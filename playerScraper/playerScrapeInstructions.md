###Requirements
1. I want to initiate scrapes of a URL from the terminal just by calling a function
2. I want to hardcode the URL to scrape within the code / function itself
3. I want the output of the function to be a csv file that I can use in Excel
4. The csv file should have three columns: Team Name, Player Name, Player Image URL. These are the three pieces of information to scrape from the URL for every player on the page.

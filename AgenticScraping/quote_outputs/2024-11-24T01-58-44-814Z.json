      "article_text": "New Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says he is happy to be the \"Smiling One\" - but is prepared to be ruthless when required.\n\nIt is more than 20 years since Amorim‚Äôs fellow Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho announced himself as \"the Special One\" to an unsuspecting Premier League audience.\n\nWhile Amorim might not be quite as charismatic as Mourinho he appears a bubbly character on first appearances.\n\nHowever, when the hard work starts at Ipswich in the league on Sunday, he knows the smiles may not last.\n\n\"I can be the Smiling One but when we have a job to do I will be a different person,\" he said.\n\n\"There are some places to have fun but I can be ruthless when I have to be.\n\n\"[I can] be the nicest guy you will ever see, but if there is someone just thinking about himself, I will be a different person.\"\n\nAmorim is still getting used to his players, although he has already expressed his \"love\" for England midfielder Mason Mount because of his attitude.\n\nAt 39, Amorim is the youngest United boss since Wilf McGuiness followed Sir Matt Busby in 1969.\n\nThe achievements of Busby and fellow Scot Sir Alex Ferguson are the basis on which the club's illustrious history is largely based.\n\nAmorim was not even two years old when Ferguson moved south to United from Aberdeen in November 1986 - and said the pair are yet to meet.\n\nHowever, United in 2024 are a world away from the one Ferguson left in 2013, let alone joined. And the former Sporting boss accepts he has to do the job his way.\n\n\"I have to be me,\" he said. \"I'm always paying attention to details, trying to focus the players on the history of the club, not just the recent history. This is a club that has to win things.\n\n\"But it's a different time. I cannot be the same guy that Alex Ferguson was - it's a different time and I need to have a different approach. But I can also be demanding.\"",

      "headline": "14:21 22 November'Dreamer' Amorim 'right guy' to revive Man Utd",
      "article_text": "**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he is the \"right man\" for the club but will need time to implement his ideas.**\n\nThe 39-year-old signed a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month to replace Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October.\n\nUnited are 13th in the Premier League table, seven points above Sunday's opponents Ipswich Town, who are fourth from bottom.\n\nWhile Amorim recognises the size of the task facing him at Old Trafford, he believes he can turn the club's fortunes around.\n\n\"I'm a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself and I believe in the club,\" he said during his first news conference as head coach.\n\n\"I think we have the same idea, the same mindset and that can help.\n\n\"I truly believe in the players, I know you don‚Äôt believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things. You guys don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible, I do.\n\n\"Call me naive, but I believe I am the right guy at the right time. I truly believe I am the right guy.\"\n\nThe Portuguese, who has joined United after four years at Sporting, insisted he will bring change in order for the club to challenge for the Premier League title again.\n\nHe added: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take.\"\n\nGiven his nationality and success in Portugal, Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho, who had spells in the Premier League with United, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nThe Fenerbahce coach spent two-and-a-half-years at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League following his appointment in 2016.\n\nAmorim, though, was keen to play down the comparisons.\n\n\"I'm different from Mourinho, I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto.\n\n\"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere. It's not the same thing. He was European champion, I am not.\n\n\"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n\n\"Their young guys were [Frank] Lampard and these kind of players, nowadays it's so much different. I think I'm right for now.\"\n\nYes, he will ultimately be judged by results on the pitch, but this was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nIn recognition of the limited time the coach has had in his new surroundings, United had chosen to stage a normal pre-match media briefing in the rather plain Jimmy Murphy building at the training ground, rather than a more formal Old Trafford unveiling of the kind previous new managers such as Erik ten Hag had held.\n\nBut this felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, the more charismatic Amorim seemed undaunted by the attention and appeared to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he was \"the right guy at the right time\", while gently accusing the media of a lack of faith.\n\nBut he also acknowledged the scale of the task he faces here after years of decline, accepting that \"we have to improve\" and \"I don‚Äôt know how long it will take\" when I asked him how long he felt he needed to repair the club.\n\nHe will also be aware that with United having spent more than half a billion pounds on new players under Ten Hag, and with Profit and Sustainability rules to comply with, he will have to largely work with the players he has got.\n\nAmorim is currently living in the same city centre hotel that Jose Mourinho used as his base during his reign at United, but is said to be close to moving into a house, and is clearly wary of being compared too closely to his compatriot.\n\nHowever, he also firmly rejected the suggestion this was 'the impossible job'. \"Of course not,\" he said.\n\nAmorim is the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford ‚Äì so a lot is resting on him. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty - a senior director at the petrochemicals company - and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it.\n\nHaving spoken for more than thirty minutes, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen.\n\nBut based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.",

      "headline": "09:33 22 NovemberPremier League clubs approve changes to APT rules",
      "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City.\n\nToday's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nAfter all, the changes the league was proposing - after a tribunal panel found elements of the APTs were unlawful - will weaken the rules. Clearly 16 clubs were loathe to loosen them even more.\n\nThe Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future.\n\nHowever, today's vote - while an emphatic defeat for City in the end - also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiralling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote.\n\nLast week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules.\n\nThey feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nClarification from the tribunal is still to be received but City feel its recommendations will end up siding with them, which will effectively make today's vote irrelevant.\n\nIn October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nManchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\n\nAfter the tribunal, City claimed the rules were \"void\" and criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion they could be swiftly amended.\n\nThe club threatened further legal action if there was a \"knee-jerk reaction\".\n\nBut following meetings of its Legal Advisory Group and Financial Controls Advisory Group, the Premier League proposed several amendments before today's vote in London.\n\nCity argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League.",

      "headline": "12:59 21 NovemberGo big or go home on Arsenal's defence - FPL tips & team of week",
      "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a ¬£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nHow did last week's team do?\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, ¬£5.5m\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, ¬£6.1m\n\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, ¬£6m\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\nLewis Hall, Newcastle, ¬£4.4m - home to West Ham\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, ¬£12.9m - away at Southampton\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, ¬£8.4m - away at Ipswich\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\nDwight McNeil, Everton, ¬£5.7m - home to Brentford\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, Fulham, ¬£5.7m - home to Wolves\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle, ¬£8.5m - home to West Ham\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa, ¬£9m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for ¬£6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nJoao Pedro, Brighton, ¬£5.5m - away at Bournemouth\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\nBernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, ¬£5m - home to Wolves\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, ¬£5.7m - home to Brighton\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\nLucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, ¬£4.7m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\nIbrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, ¬£5.4m - away at Southampton\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = ¬£98.5m\n\nTeam to target\n\nBrighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

He also sent compatriot Amorim a message to congratulate him on his appointment as successor to Erik ten Hag at United.\n\n\"I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto. \"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere.

But which players are set to benefit most?\n\nUnited fan Adam McKola tells The Football News Show why he feels Amorim sticking to his style of football can bring the best out of the likes of Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.\n\nThis was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling.

Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\nManchester United coach Darren Fletcher has been successful in reducing his touchline ban to two matches after being found guilty of misconduct against Brentford on Saturday 19 October.\n\nFletcher admitted to this misconduct, but argued that it was only towards the fourth official and the referee and that he was not abusive.\n\nHaving been sanctioned with a three-match touchline ban and ¬£7,500 fine, the independent Appeal Board has subsequently reduced the ban by one game and the fine down to ¬£6,000.\n\nNew Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.\n\nSpeaking at his first news conference, on Friday, the 39-year-old said: \"I‚Äôm a little bit of a dreamer. I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don‚Äôt believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n\n\"You guys don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible, I do.\"\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.\n\nAsked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing. \"I don‚Äôt know about repair,\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it‚Äôs a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try and win the title.\n\n\"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It‚Äôs not evolution or revolution, it‚Äôs a change in the way we play football.\"\n\nAmorim takes charge of United for the first time on Sunday, at Ipswich Town (16:30 GMT).",

He told me it‚Äôs a lovely club, big club, with lovely people and that is correct, it is.\n\n\"But a lot of things have changed.

NEVER!\"\n\nThe shock result ends City's 52-game unbeaten run at the Etihad and marks their second defeat to the London club in just 25 days having lost 2-1 to Tottenham in the EFL cup in October.\n\nThe champions' other losses in the five game slide came at the hands of Bournemouth, Sporting Lisbon and Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Guardiola said: \"In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation. Now we have to live it and break it by winning the next games, especially the next one.\n\"Now we see things in one way, maybe in a few weeks we will see it differently.\n\"Of course [the players are struggling]. We are happy when we win and concerned when we don't win. It's normal.\n\"There would be a problem if they were not worried or I am not worried.",

You heard it here first.\"\n\nWhile another joked: \"Arne Slot rocked up, hit this pose, and Pep hasn't been the same since.\"\n\nAnd one fan warned his peers not to get carried away yet, writing: \"We still have to win our game tomorrow regardless of the Manchester City result. Focus is key lads. One game at a time.\"\n\nFor their next Premier League match, Liverpool travel to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday and, should City fail to mount a comeback, the Reds will have the opportunity to go eight points clear atop the League table.\n\nAnd next weekend they will have an opportunity to extend their lead over City even further, as they welcome Pep Guardiola's side to Anfield for a mouth-watering top of the table clash.\n\nBut before the clash with City, the Merseyside team will host La Liga giants Real Madrid in a Champions League fixture at home.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the back-to-back matches against Real and City, Slot said: ‚ÄúLast season, they [players] were competitive throughout the whole season and the seasons before. So for them it is not the first time they go into a week where they face two teams that dominated football in the last four or five years in the league and Champions League.",

Literally I get out of bed, get the kids up and downstairs, get their breakfast sorted and then I'm straight into the Red Bull.\n\n\"After that we meet at the stadium for pre-match and while I'm getting changed I'll have a coffee - it's better than taking ProPlus. Red Bull, coffee and then when we get over to the pre-match lounge, I'll have my cheese and ham omelette with another can of Red Bull.\"\n\nAsked how his stomach is able to process and deal with the caffeine coming his way, Vardy replied: \"I think when you've done it for so many years I think it just gets used to it, it's not an issue whatsoever. It's one of them things, it's not going to work for everyone.\n\n\"To be fair, I've probably cut back because I'm only on a little can of Red Bull now whereas before when I was at Fleetwood I used to have the big cans of Monster - I used to have two of them as well.\"\n\nIn the past, Vardy's habits included mixing Skittles and vodka, while he also had a thing for drinking port out of a Lucozade bottle.\n\nWriting in his autobiography, Vardy said: \"I can't say why it started, because I genuinely don't know, but I decided to drink a glass of port on the eve of every game in the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"I'm not normally superstitious but from the moment I scored against Sunderland on the opening day, I didn't want to change anything.\"\n\n\"I fill a small plastic water or Lucozade bottle to halfway and just sip the port while watching television. It tastes like Ribena to me, and it helps me switch off and get to sleep a bit easier the night before a game.\"\n\nSpeaking in 2021, Vardy's former Leicester teammate, Ritchie De Laet, opened up about the time Vardy finished off a bottle of port before breaking a Premier League record.\n\n‚ÄúThe night before a game, Jamie drinks pints and only eats pizza,\" he told Belgian outlet Het Nieuwsblad.\n\n‚ÄúFor example, when he beat Ruud Van Nistelrooy‚Äôs record by scoring in 11 consecutive games; the night before, the bus driver bought us a bottle of port. We hid it in our hotel room.\n\n‚ÄúI had a glass, and Jamie made sure to finish the rest of the bottle.‚Äù",

      "article_text": "Man United supporters think they have spotted the difference between Ruben Amorim and Erik ten Hag ‚Äì and it speaks volumes.\n\nAmorim, 39, will take charge of his first match as head coach of the club when the Red Devils travel to Portman Road to face Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Portuguese oversaw first-team training this week but was without several key players due to international commitments.\n\nHe was left with just ten players on Monday, so he decided to join in the session himself.\n\nEagle-eyed fans were also trying to piece together his possible first starting XI when watching training footage released by the club earlier this week.\n\nThe United faithful also think they have spotted a ‚Äòkey difference‚Äô between former boss Ten Hag and his successor Amorim.\n\nA video compilation of the current and former United bosses emerged and directly compared the pair‚Äôs style in interviews.\n\nThe video showed Ten Hag ‚Äòawkwardly‚Äô explaining his style and philosophy before it cut to a more confident, self-assured Amorim discussing the same thing.\n\nFans weighed in with their thoughts.\n\nOne said: ‚ÄúSee the difference without playing a game yet?‚Äù\n\nA second added: ‚ÄúTen Hag's presence is rather uncomfortable. I can feel the awkwardness, and I'm not sitting there.‚Äù\n\nA third explained: ‚ÄúBoth are very different.‚Äù\n\nBut a fourth defended the former United boss, saying: ‚ÄúI still feel ten hag could be our Rodgers ..has laid a good foundation for Amorim.‚Äù\n\nWith a fifth explaining how Amorim‚Äôs mastery of the English language could possibly be the reason for coming across as more confident in his explanations, they said: ‚ÄúTen Hag is just not very good in English, and his presence is unfortunately a little awkward, that makes a bad combo.‚Äù\n\nFor most of Ten Hag‚Äôs tenure, his United sides played on the 'back-foot', utilising counterattacks as a way of punishing the opposition rather than the ‚Äòfront-foot‚Äô play United fans have been previously used to.\n\nAs for Amorim, his preferred style at his former club, Sporting, was to make use of a 3-4-3 formation with extra responsibility for the wing-backs.\n\nThe 39-year-old explained his theory on the team‚Äôs playing style during Friday‚Äôs press conference.\n\n\"As a coach, you have to choose one way or another,‚Äù he told the gathered media.\n\n‚ÄúI always, 100%, our way. I prefer to take risk but push in the first moment. Since the first moment, I believe so much in our way of playing - there‚Äôs no second way.\n\n‚ÄúWe will adapt some players because we don‚Äôt have the right profiles, as this squad was set up for a different system. When you see the team on Sunday, it will be similar players, but in the game, it will be different.",

Training, meetings, bus.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it bothered him too much though [racking up fines].\n\n‚ÄúHe will be up there [as the player with the most fines].‚Äù\n\nAfter nine years at United, Martial left the Premier League side at the end of the 2023/24 season after his contract was not renewed and signed a three-year deal with Greek giants AEK.\n\nJones played at United for the entirety of the Frenchman's time there and the pair made 68 appearances together across all competitions.\n\nAnd the English defender isn't the only one to have exposed Martial's poor timekeeping while playing at United, as the striker was spotted turning up for a training session nearly four hours early last year.\n\nA report from the Manchester Evening News states that Martial turned up at Carrington for the session at 8.56am and left four minutes later after being told the session wasn't due to take place until later in the day.\n\nHis teammates began showing up to Carrington at 11:30, with Martial himself coming back to Carrington at 12.23pm.\n\nWhile speaking to SPORTbible, Jones also revealed which of his former United teammates was the loudest in the dressing room.\n\n\"I‚Äôll go with David De Gea,\" said the ex-England international.\n\n‚ÄúJust because he always liked to play his music, his reggaeton music and he was into heavy metal, he used to put that on in the dressing room and the lads would be like: ‚Äòis he sure?‚Äô\n\n\"So I‚Äôd go with De Gea, his music was terrible.‚Äù",

Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony.\n\nQuickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to.

I will be here.\n\n\"Next year, if we are in the Conference we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now.\n\n\"I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, \"It's the last year of Pep'.

It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League‚Äôs decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n‚ÄúThe amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n‚ÄúThe Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League‚Äôs ‚Äòdatabank‚Äô is shared with a club‚Äôs advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.",

      "article_text": "Former Liverpool CEO Peter Moore has revealed what he knows about the discussions regarding Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk‚Äôs contracts.\n\nMoore, 69, was the Reds‚Äô CEO between 2017 and 2020, and his work coincided with Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs Champions League and Premier League winning success ‚Äì in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nSeveral of the players involved in the triumphs are still at the club, with Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Van Dijk‚Äôs futures still unclear.\n\nAll three players are set to see their contracts expire at the end of the season, with Moore‚Äôs fellow Liverpudlian Alexander-Arnold heavily linked with a move to La Liga outfit Real Madrid.\n\nThe former Liverpool chief was no stranger to dealing with these types of situations during his tenure at Anfield, and he explained what he knew about the situation.\n\n‚ÄúI don't know what's going to happen [with the contracts],‚Äù he told Soccerex in Miami.\n\n‚ÄúIf it's Trent, it's Virgil, it's Mo. It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool.\n\n\"Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three.\n\n‚ÄúI don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n‚ÄúEven in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.‚Äù\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had ‚Äúno idea‚Äù what the future holds when speaking to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a ¬£150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

      "article_text": "New Man United head coach Ruben Amorim could be set to hand one player his competitive debut for the club on Sunday.\n\nAmorim, 39, will take charge of his new side for the first time at Portman Road against Ipswich Town on Sunday, 24 November, having finally started in his new role on Monday, 11 November.\n\nAs expected, fans have paid close attention to training footage released by the club this week as they try to piece together his first starting XI - with the Portuguese having taken a liking to one winger in particular.\n\nDuring his successful spell at his former club, Sporting, he regularly employed a 3-4-3 formation - something that is not widely used by the current crop of Premier League managers.\n\nHis preferred tactic puts the emphasis on his defenders, with the full-backs made to work hard in both attack and defence to avoid exposing one of the three centre-backs.\n\nFormer United boss Erik ten Hag had a preferred centre-back pairing of Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez with Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof as back-up.\n\nHowever, this weekend, a forgotten man may come into the squad.\n\nAccording to reports from Daily Mail, Leny Yoro has featured during Amorim‚Äôs training drills this week and was even ‚Äòpulled out‚Äô of an Under-21 squad, who were due to face Altrincham on Tuesday.\n\nYoro, 19, joined United in a ¬£52m deal after impressing for French club Lille during the 2023/24 Ligue 1 season.\n\nFans were excited at his arrival, but he sustained a fractured metatarsal while playing a game against Arsenal in pre-season, meaning he has failed to make his competitive debut for United.\n\nThe club announced that the defender returned to full first-team training in early November.\n\nWhether he is ‚Äòmatch-fit‚Äô is still unclear, but it is possible that Yoro could play a part in Sunday‚Äôs fixture.\n\nUpon joining United in July 2024, Yoro admitted that a former Red Devils and England defender helped him make his choice of joining the club.\n\n\"He [Rio Ferdinand] called me,‚Äù Yoro told Manchester United‚Äôs official website.\n\n\"First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice.\n\n‚ÄúIt was really an honour to speak with him.\n\n\"He spoke to me about the club, and that this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there, I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. For me, it was really good to speak about this.\"",

      "article_text": "Legendary football commentator Clive Tyldesley has revealed he could be commentating on his final game on UK television next month.\n\nTyldesley is one of the most recognisable voices for football fans in the UK, having enjoyed an incredible 32-year career across TV and radio for the likes of ITV and BBC.\n\nHe is renowned for providing commentary on some of the biggest moments in the Champions League and international competitions like the World Cup and European Championships.\n\nDemoted by ITV as Sam Matterface became the lead commentator, the 70-year old commentated on Euro 2024 for the broadcaster while out in Germany before he left after not being handed a new contract.\n\nHe has continued to carry out commentary work for Amazon Prime as part of their Premier League coverage, which includes 20 games in their package. But although Amazon still have rights to some Champions League fixtures, they did not bid for the Premier League TV rights which come into effect from the 2025/26 season and lasts until the end of the 2028/29 campaign.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports will share packages after reaching a ¬£6.7billion rights agreement, the biggest in sports history.\n\nTyldesley is booked in for a clash between Brighton and Brentford on 27 December but he has admitted it could well be a final bow for him.\n\n\"What actually could be the final game I ever commentate for UK television is Brighton-Brentford,\" he told the Anfield Wrap podcast.\n\n\"That won't be dull. That's on 27 December. Amazon Prime, this is their final year, so the Premier League going forward is going back to a two-man cartel of Sky and TNT.\"\n\nGoing forward Sky Sports will show a minimum of 215 games live, with TNT slated for 52 matches. Tyldesley still has an existing deal with CBS Sports for Champions League commentary in the United States and does work for Rangers TV.\n\nBack in July, Tyldesley made it clear that he has no intention of hanging up his microphone just yet.\n\n\"All I can do is keeping reviewing my own standards, keep making myself available,\" he said on his podcast.\n\n\"If someone like CBS - who have given me a four-year contract to cover Champions League for the USA - show that sort of confidence in me then I can only assure you I will repay that faith by working bloody hard and trying to be as good as I can be.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim warned his Manchester United players he has a ruthless streak he will not be afraid to use if they fail to meet his demands. The Portuguese has a reputation as an astute man-manager as well as an innovative tactician but it will not all be sweetness and light.\n\nThe 39-year-old begins life as head coach at Ipswich on Sunday aware of the task ahead as he tries to turn United around. Amorim arrived with the team 13th in the Premier League after four wins from 11 matches and needing to improve results if they are to have ambitions of European qualification for next season.\n\n‚ÄúI can be ruthless when I have to be,‚Äù Amorim said. ‚ÄúIf you think as a team I will be the nicest guy that you have ever seen, if there is someone just thinking that, I will be a different person. I‚Äôm not that kind of guy that wants to show that he is a boss. They will feel it in the small details. I can be the smiling one, but then when you have a job to do I will be a different person, and they understand that.‚Äù\n\nAmorim insists he will take risks to change the tactics and style but will have limited training time because of United‚Äôs hectic schedule. There will be two games a week for the foreseeable future as United balance domestic and European competition. Amorim will get his first taste of Old Trafford on Thursday when Bod√∏/Glimt visit in the Europa League.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so much harder to come to a team in the middle of the season,‚Äù Amorim said, ‚Äúbecause you have to know the players during the games, so you are talking about no national-team periods to work with the players ‚Äì it‚Äôs just games. If you are winning, it‚Äôs a lot of fun having a lot of games, trying to make some changes tactically and winning. But if you are losing, you don‚Äôt have the time in training to work out everything you want to work.\n\n‚ÄúWhere you can improve a team is in training; this is the most important aspect. You can tell the players to recover and to react really fast but if you don‚Äôt make any exercise with that it‚Äôs really hard to do it on video or during recovery training but we will find ways to try to cope.‚Äù\n\nAlthough Amorim‚Äôs predecessor, Erik ten Hag, won a trophy in each of his two full seasons, that United have not secured the league title since 2013 looms large over Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson was the most recent United manager to lift the trophy. He did so 13 times and is the club‚Äôs most successful manager.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to copy someone, so I have to be me,‚Äù Amorim said when asked whether he had sought Ferguson‚Äôs advice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the best person to show the history of Manchester United. It should be the club first and also me, because I‚Äôm always paying attention to those details and try to focus our players on the history of the club, but not the recent history.\n\n‚ÄúYou have to be very demanding. This is a club that needs to win, it has to win ‚Äì we have to show that to our players. It‚Äôs a different time; I cannot be the same guy Sir Alex Ferguson was. I have to have a different approach but I can also be demanding with a different approach. That is my focus.",

      "headline": "Schooled like Mourinho: Amorim‚Äôs path from pioneering Lisbon university",
      "article_text": "Portugal‚Äôs coaches and players are all the rage in part thanks to links forged between academia and the game.\n\nThey always knew Ruben Amorim was a special one at the faculty of human kinetics. \"I interviewed him for the course and from the start it was obvious,\" says Prof Ant√≥nio Veloso, Jos√© Mourinho‚Äôs former classmate, who runs the high-performance football coaching course at the faculty, which is affiliated to the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"The students needed to do an essay on specialist topics and Ruben‚Äôs results were fantastic. He had a leadership role in the group. When we were doing tactical drills on the pitch all the other students were looking at Ruben‚Äôs and asking for his opinion. But he was very humble.\"\n\nPerhaps then he is not an exact replica of the original Special One, who also studied at the faculty and remains a close friend of Veloso. The professor recalls Mourinho as a 26-year-old, when he had dropped out of business school and conceded that becoming a professional footballer was outside of his skill set. He had signed up for the sports science course and took an especially enthusiastic interest in the university football league and the team of professors of which he was player-coach. \"The same killer instinct he showed afterwards was already there,\" Veloso says. \"I remember him telling his teammates: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt be soft! Be tough!‚Äô\"\n\nPortuguese coaches are all the rage, as Amorim‚Äôs appointment confirms. Where once the UK sent managers such as Sir Bobby Robson, Graeme Souness and John Mortimore to Portugal, a line stretching back to Arthur John in the 1920s, now there are as many Portuguese as English coaches in the Premier League. They are also the fourth-best represented nation in terms of Premier League players, after England, Brazil and France. Portugal has a population of 10.5 million and it is hard to think of a nation punching more above its weight in European football.\n\nPart of the answer as to why is perhaps found in Cruz Quebrada, the sleepy Lisbon suburb overlooking the spectacular Tagus estuary, where the faculty that helped form the current and former United managers is located. Everyone knows Mourinho got his big break as Robson‚Äôs translator at Sporting but fewer recall that Mourinho‚Äôs initial pathway into football was academic.\n\nVeloso stayed in academia after his sports science course but also remained in touch with his classmate, so when he wanted to set up a master‚Äôs degree course in football coaching, he took Mourinho‚Äôs brain and downloaded it into an academic course.\n\n\"It was exactly like that,\" Veloso says. \"Jos√© was always mentioning that he studied here and naming our faculty as his alma mater. If we were designing a finance course, we would definitely use someone [in that sector] of his level to help us. So I called him and said: ‚ÄòI think we have a unique opportunity to develop a programme based on your knowledge of football, linked with your academic background. You‚Äôre in a unique position, having a scientific view of your profession.‚Äô\"\n\nThe course they developed covers everything Mourinho considered important, though not any of his dark arts. They teach psychology that goes well beyond the superficial motivational pep talk, a deeper level of physiology and how to manage upwards to a Russian oligarch or private equity fund manager.\n\nThe EFL chair, Rick Parry, runs the module on governance, including role-playing how to respond when your player has made a racist remark, and a body language expert instructs on non-verbal communication so as to transmit positive messages to players from the bench.\n\nAmorim was accepted as one of the early intakes, in 2017, even though, as a footballer at Belenenses and Benfica, he had never been to university. Special provision is made for smart candidates who, for obvious reasons, have never completed a first degree. Whether the course will provide him with an edge in Manchester is unclear, given Carlos Vicens, Pep Guardiola‚Äôs No 2, was a star pupil the year after Amorim attended. Pedro Marques, Liverpool‚Äôs director of football development, and two of Amorim‚Äôs assistants have studied on separate courses at the faculty.\n\nIt is telling that academia and football are comfortable bedfellows in a way they have never been in England. Mutual suspicion in the Great British class war has meant those in ivory towers don‚Äôt mix with workers at the grassroots on the pitch. But Portugal is different and another Manchester United man, Carlos Queiroz, is largely responsible.\n\nIt was Prof Mirandela da Costa, who headed up the football department at the faculty and was director general of the Portuguese board of sport, who asked his best student, Queiroz, to revamp their football in the 80s. Queiroz, whose paper on youth development and coaching became a sacred text, subsequently coached what became known as the Golden Generation, starring Lu√≠s Figo, Rui Costa and Gil Gomes, to Under-20 World Cup titles in 1989 and 1991.\n\nFrom that acorn grew the mighty oaks of the country‚Äôs football, which arguably could be personified in Mourinho, Cristiano Ronaldo and their mutual agent, Jorge Mendes, whose innate understanding of the 21st century football market did so much to conquer European leagues. \"Jos√© opened the door for Portuguese coaches,\" Veloso says. \"But it was more like a gate than a door. And Ronaldo opened a door for players.\" A Portuguese player tends to come kite-marked with quality assurance.\n\n\"The starting point of the revolution was the link between academia and the Portuguese federation,\" Veloso says. \"And then we got lucky to get some people who were extremely good. But it would be difficult to imagine someone [at a British university] asking your top Manchester United coach to organise a coach education programme such as ours.\"\n\nWhen Sir Alex Ferguson retired, it was Harvard Business School that tapped into his expertise by signing him up for lectures. Oxford and Cambridge universities, both of whom had representation on the FA council until last year, probably never considered that an option. Veloso, who knows plenty of open-minded people in British academia, as well as talented graduates at Premier League clubs, says: \"You need to have both worlds together, with experienced people working at a high level.\"\n\nIf Amorim can succeed at Old Trafford, perhaps he can be part of bridging that gap.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim eyes golden chance as he enters Manchester United vortex",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim eyes golden chance as he enters Manchester United vortex | Manchester United | The Guardian\n\nDespite a torrid start to the season the club remain within touching distance of top four as new head coach arrives\n\nWith his breezy manner, shock of jet-black wavy hair and declaration that ‚Äúwe choose our way 100%‚Äù, Ruben Amorim exuded the fresh energy Manchester United need in his debut media conference at a crammed Jimmy Murphy Centre.\n\nWith only four points to third place, there is a golden chance to transform the season. Yet the issues Amorim wrestles with are the club he has walked into and the squad he has inherited.\n\nThe 39-year-old was enthusiastic about his ‚Äúmany meetings‚Äù at United and was firm regarding his belief in the players he drills on the pitches outside. Wearing a club tracksuit top with red front panels and blue sleeves, Amorim was as open under questioning as Erik ten Hag could be taciturn. But different personalities did not prevent the Dutchman, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jos√© Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r from being sucked into the black hole of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson United.\n\nIt is a vortex that cannot be comprehended until experienced. The above quintet can point to how mismanagement at executive level caused the fatal corollary of muddled player recruitment. So Amorim‚Äôs task is to work the oracle with a squad that apart from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Mart√≠nez and Marcus Rashford (if he can rediscover consistency) is average.\n\nAsked why he believed in a group that got Ten Hag the sack, Amorim said: ‚ÄúThe only thing I ask: hard work and you have to believe in the new idea. And I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players.‚Äù\n\nAs United‚Äôs new football chief, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was billed as the required boardroom reset. But after failing to axe Ten Hag in the summer, United invested ¬£200m on five footballers wanted by the manager ‚Äì Manuel Ugarte, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee ‚Äì before a puzzling Ratcliffe U-turn removed the Dutchman last month.\n\nSo a reasonable view is that the minority owner and his chief executive, Omar Berrada, and sporting director, Dan Ashworth, are yet to show spectacular improvement on the two previous power axes of Richard Arnold/John Murtough and Ed Woodward/Murtough; and that Amorim may end as the latest man in the Old Trafford hot seat ejected by dodgy decisions from above.\n\nFor now, he has a unit that includes 14 Ten Hag recruits who have to be weaved into his 3-4-3 along with Fernandes and Rashford, who predated his predecessor and whose maverick talents are vital yet tricky to fit into a cohesive unit.\n\nAmorim presented the challenge this way: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about repair but we have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas: the understanding of the game, I know it‚Äôs a different way of playing, and we are changing in the middle of the season.\n\n‚ÄúWe have to improve the physical aspect. And that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take. I know when you are in Manchester United you have to win games. So I will not tell you that I need a lot of time. It‚Äôs a great league, it‚Äôs the strongest league in the world and we have to improve a lot to try to win it. So what I can say is we have to win games to win time and then to win titles.‚Äù This is what he is being paid the thick end of ‚Ç¨10m (¬£8.3m) a year for.\n\nReviving Marcus Rashford will be a key task for Ruben Amorim. Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA\n\nTen Hag finished third in his opening season but this was achieved with a misfiring attack that managed only 58 goals and United had a goal difference of 15, the division‚Äôs sixth-best. The key then was Rashford‚Äôs 17 Premier League goals, so reviving a forward who packs pace, height, strength and verve is as high on Amorim‚Äôs list as fitting him and Fernandes into his unfamiliar shape.\n\nOf this, Amorim said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not revolution because football is not so different with five players in the back, three players in the back or four players in the back. I cannot say evolution because we will have to wait and see but we will play a different type of football.\n\n‚ÄúWe have our ideas. I‚Äôm not saying these are the best ideas, but it‚Äôs our way of seeing football. It‚Äôs not evolution or revolution, it‚Äôs a change in the way we play football. We lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball. We have to be better running back. That is clear for everybody. And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also the small things and we are here to improve on the small things, the way we see football, play as a team. Understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help these players a lot.‚Äù\n\nThe Portuguese, who fielded questions from nine journalists who flew in from his homeland, will have to if he is to achieve United‚Äôs holy grail of a 21st championship. A zesty charisma will help. It was on display again when he was asked about his compatriot Mourinho.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm different,‚Äù Amorim said. ‚ÄúYou looked at Mourinho and you felt he can win everywhere. He was European champion. I‚Äôm not European champion. I‚Äôm a different guy in a different moment.\n\n‚ÄúFootball nowadays is different and I am the right person at the moment. I am a young guy, I understand the players, so I try to use that to help my players. It is still the best club in England and we want to win.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United are years away from the title",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has denied that being Manchester United‚Äôs head coach is the impossible job but says his two-and-a-half-year contract is not long enough to win the title.\n\nAmorim is United‚Äôs sixth permanent appointment since they were last Premier League champions, under Sir Alex Ferguson, in May 2013. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jos√© Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r and Erik ten Hag failed to make them contenders. He was reminded of this and asked whether United was the impossible job.\n\n‚ÄúNo, of course not,‚Äù the 39-year-old said. ‚ÄúCall me naive but I believe I am the right guy at the right moment. I could be wrong but the Earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm not worried about that. I truly believe I‚Äôm the right guy for this job. I really don‚Äôt know the biggest challenge here ‚Äì I will find out during the next months.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little bit of a dreamer, and I believe in myself, I also believe in the club. We have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help, but I truly believe in the players also. I know you guys don‚Äôt believe a lot in these players. But I believe a lot. We have room to improve, I want to try new things. You guys think it‚Äôs not possible; I think it‚Äôs possible. We will see in the end.‚Äù\n\nAmorim is contracted until summer 2027 but believes longer is required to claim United a 21st title. ‚ÄúI have two years and a half. In two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. We will need more time ‚Äì if you look at the clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time.\n\n‚ÄúI understand we will need more than two and a half years. We have to win something, somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue this part with him or change.\n\n‚ÄúYou have here different types of coaches: the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskj√¶r, then one of the best outside the top five leagues ‚Äì Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we have to win games. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do the Ineos way, my way.‚Äù\n\nAmorim was asked why he had confidence in players whose form caused Ten Hag to be sacked. United are 13th but only four points behind third-placed Chelsea.\n\n‚ÄúYou have to believe and I believe in them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I start this week ‚Ä¶ you can say only one week training but they are open to different things. The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the idea.‚Äù\n\nHe accepts the squad has lost confidence. ‚ÄúThat is for sure but normal. When players don‚Äôt win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up if they are confident or not. I have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half they will change so they have to find that mindset.\n\nAmorim‚Äôs opening game is Sunday‚Äôs trip to Ipswich and he said he would stick with his 3-4-3 system. ‚ÄúAs a coach you have to choose one way or another,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI always choose 100% our way. I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way.\n\n‚ÄúWe will adapt some players because we don‚Äôt have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.‚Äù\n\nAmorim wants a major influence regarding recruitment. ‚ÄúWe have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. It is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.\n\n‚ÄúIt is not the final word, but I have a great responsibility when we choose the players.",

Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Est√°dio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim‚Äôs home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim‚Äôs first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim‚Äôs spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n‚ÄúWhen he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,‚Äù says the former Casa Pisa forward Jos√© Embal√≥. ‚ÄúI went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Ad√©lio C√¢ndido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n‚ÄúAd√©lio [C√¢ndido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,‚Äù says Embal√≥. ‚ÄúThey have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Ad√©lio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football ‚Äì they showed me age doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù\n\nAmorim‚Äôs 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,‚Äù Embal√≥ says. ‚ÄúAt that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n‚ÄúHe benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn‚Äôt show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‚ÄòLook, Jos√©, I know your feelings, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. Don‚Äôt worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.‚Äô That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.‚Äù\n\nEmbal√≥ has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. ‚ÄúAs a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,‚Äù says the 31-year-old. ‚ÄúI used to go to training and after I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.‚Äù\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of Jos√© Mourinho‚Äôs former assistant, Jos√© Morais.\n\n‚ÄúSometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,‚Äù Russiano says. ‚ÄúHe knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it‚Äôs very important for our intelligence as coaches.‚Äù\n\nWhen Russiano‚Äôs Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. ‚ÄúThe secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn‚Äôt have Viktor Gy√∂keres back then,‚Äù Russiano says. ‚ÄúIt was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gy√∂keres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.‚Äù\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,‚Äù says Russiano. ‚ÄúThis is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He‚Äôs ready for this.",

      "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane.\n\nSusanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n‚ÄúAt some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‚ÄòCan we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?‚Äô‚Äù Lawson said.\n\n‚ÄúWe turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think ‚Äì I lost track of time ‚Äì five or 10 minutes.‚Äù\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was ‚Äúabsolutely fine‚Äù, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. ‚ÄúWhat an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it. [The air stewards] just called for help and help came.‚Äù\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n‚ÄúI basically said to Bruno: ‚ÄòWhat you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help‚Äô,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe ridiculous thing is we‚Äôre a blue family ‚Äì we support Manchester City.‚Äù",

      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches Ren√© Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: ‚ÄúRuud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.‚Äù\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting, and although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Ad√©lio C√¢ndido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club‚Äôs training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United‚Äôs chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club‚Äôs facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is underway and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim‚Äôs toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n‚ÄúI think a back three or a back four, it‚Äôs in general the same ‚Äì the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,‚Äù De Ligt said. ‚ÄúYou can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it‚Äôs going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That‚Äôs going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.\"",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United‚Äôs head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim‚Äôs plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be difficult, I‚Äôm not under any illusions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI feel ready for the new challenge. I‚Äôm not naive, I know it‚Äôs going to be very different, very difficult. I‚Äôm at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I‚Äôm looking forward to starting tomorrow.‚Äù\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag‚Äôs dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday‚Äôs 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. ‚ÄúWe will learn what the further plan is now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].‚Äù\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United‚Äôs opener against Leicester, said: ‚ÄúRuud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.‚Äù\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn‚Äôt changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.‚Äù\n\nSteve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. ‚ÄúJamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn‚Äôt been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,‚Äù the Leicester manager said. ‚ÄúRicky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.",

      "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester\n\nEleven days after Manchester United routed Leicester under Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Carabao Cup here, the interim manager signed off with another easy-street win over the Foxes and so ends his four-game term unbeaten.\n\nIn all the Dutchman has three victories, and for this one he could thank Bruno Fernandes, who graced a 250th United appearance by scoring the first goal and causing enough trouble for the hapless Victor Kristiansen to bundle past his goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for the second.\n\nFernandes‚Äôs goal was a fourth of Van Nistelrooy‚Äôs brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain‚Äôs previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag has been replaced by R√∫ben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is due to be on Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one.\n\nFernandes said: ‚ÄúIt was a long time that I wasn‚Äôt scoring and now goals are coming in the last few games.‚Äù\n\nIn an unsurprising move, Van Nistelrooy‚Äôs one change from the XI that drew with Chelsea last Sunday was finding a place for the explosive aggression of Amad Diallo ‚Äì Alejandro Garnacho was the fall guy ‚Äì and his thrust had the visitors on their heels throughout.\n\nOne dart swept the 22-year-old deep into Leicester territory and provoked Abdul Fatawu into upending him. Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared.\n\nUnited hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped.\n\nThe first of Diallo‚Äôs double in Thursday‚Äôs match was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out.\n\nThe Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes‚Äôs opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper‚Äôs team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner.\n\nUnited were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him ‚Äì understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat Andr√© Onana at close range.\n\nCue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi. Yet overall United were akin to a boxer ahead on points keeping the opposing pugilist at arm‚Äôs length with their jab: of this, Harry Winks‚Äô hit-and-hope effort was emblematic.\n\nBut the gaps in midfield remained in quick transition and so Winks‚Äô lob into Buonanotte left United scrambling and Mazraoui appearing to take him down. This occurred on the borderline of the area but Peter Bankes gave neither penalty nor free-kick, the referee invoking the travelling faithful‚Äôs ire.\n\nA far more sour pill was theirs to swallow next, in what was a calamity of errors from those in blue. Mazraoui‚Äôs flighted delivery was missed comically by both Jannik Vestergaard and Wout Faes, and Kristiansen‚Äôs nightmare continued as the ball glanced off the marauding Fernandes‚Äô thigh and pinged in off the defender for an own goal and 2-0. The half ended with Diallo burning a hole through Leicester and shooting, though the sharp Hermansen beat his effort away.\n\nCould United close this out? Being unable to seal the deal has been one of their major faults. Manuel Ugarte was a fire-dousing dynamo who did his best to ensure they did so. A chop of Buonanotte that gave a free-kick near United‚Äôs D was due to this enthusiasm but the hash Leicester made of the dead ball let him off the hook.\n\nOn 57 minutes Van Nistelrooy removed a disappointing Rashford for Garnacho and Diogo Dalot for Jonny Evans (perhaps for a knock), Lisandro Mart√≠nez moving to left-back and Mazraoui to right-back.\n\nAfter a clip on the ankle that needed treatment, Mart√≠nez fed Garnacho but he muddled down a cul-de-sac near the left corner flag and James Justin mopped up. The winger did the precise same thing after a glorious left-footed 40-yard Ugarte parabola took him clear. As Garnacho reached the area, a cutback on Faes failed, and he fell over.\n\nBut the 20-year-old laughed last and loudest thanks to a seventh goal of the campaign created by Fernandes‚Äôs curving pass and finished by an arrow from the winger that allowed Hermansen scant chance.\n\nHis celebration was muted. Fernandes said: ‚ÄúGarnacho scored a banger but didn‚Äôt celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him: ‚ÄòPeople will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.‚Äô‚Äù",

      "headline": "Will Amorim change Manchester United or will his style alter due to the squad?",
      "article_text": "Incoming manager likes a 3-4-3 formation but the players he will have available do not look obviously suited to it.\n\nRuben Amorim has already flagged his greatest challenge when taking over Manchester United on Monday: to make the club of Billy Meredith, George Best, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo play again in the tradition of these irresistible attacking forces.\n\nThe ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor has been missing from those donning United colours for most of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r‚Äôs off-the-cuff counterattack play apart, the teams of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jos√© Mourinho and Erik ten Hag lacked the dizzying fizz of United‚Äôs finest vintages.\n\nWhen Amorim declared after Sporting‚Äôs 4-1 Champions League rout of Manchester City on Tuesday night that United cannot play as defensively as the Portuguese champions, he signalled an intent to make his iteration a front-foot, box-office proposition.\n\nHis clear challenge is how to engineer this with a side in 13th place before the weekend‚Äôs fixtures ‚Äì they host Leicester today ‚Äì and with players unaccustomed to his preferred 3-4-3 configuration. \"United cannot play the way we play, they cannot be so defensive,\" he said after his Sporting side had sat back and waited to play on the break against Pep Guardiola‚Äôs City.\n\nHowever, Amorim often harnesses the counterattack against higher-quality opposition and you have to wonder if United will be markedly more attacking than Sporting were in midweek. How the Old Trafford crowd will receive this is another matter. Even Solskj√¶r, who restored the bond between club and supporters broken by his predecessor, Mourinho, drew ire for playing on the break.\n\nUntil Amorim can start building the squad he desires, whether his United can excite in his first months in charge will depend on an inherited group of players that are not obviously suited to his direction.\n\nUnited have six central defenders so perming three for any matchday for the rearguard trident should be no problem. If his preferred lineup is Lisandro Mart√≠nez, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro (once fit), Amorim faces the question of whether they can initiate his tactics that build attacks from deep.\n\nIn the Portuguese‚Äôs middle quartet, the wing-backs at United will be called on to perform an unfamiliar role. At Sporting, Amorim has fielded the pacy Geovany Quenda on the left and Maximiliano Ara√∫jo on the right, inverted wing-backs operating on the opposing flank to their natural sides. At United Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are candidates as right-sided defenders whom Amorim could select on either flank. Beyond whether they are able to adapt to the position, it will be intriguing to see whether either has the pace required to operate expertly by sprinting back and forward in attack and defence.\n\nAmorim has a further problem regarding the reliability of two injury-plagued left-backs in Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The manager could plump for Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to patrol the corridors but neither are renowned for their defensive discipline.\n\nAntony may feel a flatlining United career has a chance of revival with a move to the position but, now in a third season at United, this seems an outside prospect. If this key part of the XI does not function, Amorim could consider a return to Sporting to sign one of Quenda and Ara√∫jo but with funds limited a January move may not be possible.\n\nCentral midfield presents another conundrum. If Amorim wishes to operate a flat four then he must find a way to fit in the two creative forces of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes. But there would be no room for either Manuel Ugarte, as a dedicated holding player, or Casemiro.\n\nA diamond formation may be the solution, with Ugarte or Casemiro at the base, plus wing-backs either side and Fernandes or Mainoo at the tip. But one of the latter two would miss out, which, for a team whose heritage demands buccaneering football, seems unlikely and contradicts Amorim‚Äôs own declaration that United should not be dour.\n\nHis front three seems the least complicated selection area. On either wing, he can pick two from Garnacho, Rashford and the ever-improving Amad Diallo, with Rasmus H√∏jlund at centre-forward. But definitely far more involved is the requirement to solve the paucity of goals, a mere nine scored in 10 Premier League games.\n\nA calling card of the elite coach is how they adapt to the players already in their squad: footballers‚Äô abilities come first, not the system. It is a mantra of City‚Äôs Guardiola, and United are about to discover whether Amorim belongs in a similar class of manager.",

I thought that through and I knew that coming to Manchester United was for me a special occasion where I felt I wanted to be part of this journey with the club in also an assistant role. I had clear ambitions to manage, I made the decision to sign a two-year deal as an assistant and I‚Äôm still in that frame of mind to be fair, to stay in that capacity.‚Äù\n\nAmorim starts work on Monday and will hold talks with Van Nistelrooy about the Dutchman‚Äôs role at United. The Portuguese will have almost a fortnight to plan for his first match in charge away against Ipswich, although most of his players will be on international duty for the majority of that period.\n\nOne key area for Amorim to address is a lack of goals. Thirteenth-placed United have scored nine times in 10 Premier League games and will need to improve that record if they are to move up the table. ‚ÄúWhen you want to be a successful side in the Premier League and in Europe, you‚Äôre going to need a certain amount of goals,‚Äù Van Nistelrooy said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the best teams in the world have those players. At the moment we have players who get a certain amount of goals or assists but obviously they are in an age when they have to be developed, and there‚Äôs potential that they will be, and the belief is they can. In this moment that‚Äôs where we are.‚Äù\n\nUnited were handed a boost on Friday with the return of Luke Shaw to training. The left-back has not played for the club since February, however he will not be available for Sunday‚Äôs game.\n\nThe United coach Darren Fletcher has been banned from the touchline for three games for his behaviour at half-time against Brentford in October. A Football Association independent regulatory commission found that he had ‚Äúacted in an improper and/or confrontational manner and/or that he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official and the referee and/or assistant referees around the tunnel area‚Äù. The club hopes to reduce the ban on appeal.",

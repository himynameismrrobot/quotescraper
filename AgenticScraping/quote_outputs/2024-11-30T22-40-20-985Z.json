        "article_text": "Noussair Mazraoui has quickly endeared himself to Man Utd fans and he is getting as much love from the coaching staff as the terraces.\n\nBy\n[Tyrone Marshall](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/authors/tyrone-marshall/) Senior Football Writer\n\n*   Until this week, Noussair Mazraoui had never played as a centre-back before. That he has taken to a specialised role in a new system with the minimum of fuss will be no surprise to the supporters who have quickly taken the Morrocan to heart at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\n\nMazraoui has only played 19 games for [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), but he's already played four different positions. In just two games, the 27-year-old looks tailor-made for the right centre-back slot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\n\nWith United building play in a back three and defending as a four, Mazraoui's versatility to switch between centre-back and right-back is invaluable. Along with Bruno Fernandes, he is the only outfield player to play every minute of Amorim's first two games in charge, and the head coach likes what he sees.\n\n\"He’s an incredible player, he’s our future,\" Amorim said of Mazraoui after the win against Bodo/Glimt. \"He played in different positions, he always looks fresh but we have to be careful. There’s a lot of games but he’s here to stay. This kind of player is what we need.\"\n\nMazraoui has looked unflustered in adapting to a new role, and although it has changed how he sees the game, he is enjoying its benefits.\n\n“ This is the first time. It’s nice. You have to view the game differently because you are not as high up the pitch like when you are the full-back,\" he said. \"But you get more time on the ball and you must make the most of that in the build-up. There are some different things I have to do but it’s still the same game.\"\n\nAmorim has road-tested 17 different starters in his first two games in charge, but Mazraoui seems someone set for a long-term role, with the Portuguese describing him as the type of player he needs.\n\n“It’s a big compliment to hear the coach say that,\" he said. \"What can I say? I try my best every day and in every game. I give my all for the team, for the coach and for the supporters.\n\n“We are all in this together. It isn’t about one player.”\n\nUnited's spending across three summer windows under Erik ten Hag hit more than £600m. Mazraoui was one of the cheaper buys, at an initial £12.8m, with a further £4.2m in add-ons, but he looks like a bargain.\n\nSupporters have already taken him to their hearts. His combative style is celebrated on social media and his low-key passion and commitment have won over a fanbase who were disappointed by the team's start to the season.\n\nMazraoui underwent minor surgery after complaining of palpitations back in September, but having initially been told he would be sidelined for a few weeks, he ended up not missing a game. That is the kind of commitment that has made him such a popular figure at Old Trafford, although when that was put to him, he was unaware of his status.\n\n“To be honest I’ve not seen a lot \\[about that\\], but it gives me a really good feeling to hear that about the fans. I love the fans and I always say in every interview that I give my all for them,\" he said. \n\n\"I hope and I think they see that, that I give my all for the badge and for the supporters. Everybody wants to go home with a win and when I can give that to them as a player and as a team that’s what you do it for.\"\n\nMazraoui has had a close-up view of Amorim's start to life at Old Trafford, with a draw against Ipswich followed by a victory against Bodo Glimt.\n\nThere have been plenty of changes as the head coach instils his 3-4-3 system into a new group of players and although Mazraoui accepts it will take time for everyone to adapt, he is confident in the player's ability to do just that.\n\n“I think always when you want to implement a new style of play that isn’t even close to how we played before then no-one can expect us to understand everything the manager has in his mind right from the start,\" he said. \n\n“So yes, of course, this is going to be a tough time - but come on, we are all top players and we play the game to win. Eventually we will get to wherever the coach wants us to be.\n\n“We have unbelievable players. Of course we can adapt and I think we are showing that. We have to get used to the new style, but I don’t think it will take too long.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United host Everton at Old Trafford in the Premier League prior to Manchester City's important trip to leaders Liverpool.\n\nBy Hannah Pinnock\n\nRuben Amorim will take charge of his first Premier League game at Old Trafford on Sunday when Manchester United host Everton.\n\nThe Portuguese coach has overseen two games so far, including a 1-1 draw away at Ipswich Town and a narrow 3-2 UEFA Europa League victory at home to Norwegian side FK Bodo/Glimt. United sit 13th and 12th in the Premier League and European standings respectively.\n\nOn Sunday, they welcome Merseyside club Everton to Old Trafford at an earlier time of 1:30pm. Typically, the two Sunday slots for the Premier League are the later times of 2pm and 4:30pm.\n\nWhile an official reason hasn't been given for the change to the earlier kick-off times, it's most likely due to the Liverpool vs Manchester City clash taking place at 4pm instead of 4:30pm.\n\nThe MEN has previously reported the decision was made at the request of Merseyside Police in light of supporter trouble in previous meetings between the two teams. Therefore, the earlier games have likely been moved to avoid any crossover of TV coverage, with Chelsea's game against Villa also set to be broadcast on Sky Sports.\n\nAmorim will hope his side can gain some ground in the top four chase with a victory over Everton this weekend as they will then travel to face title chasers Arsenal midweek in the Premier League. City meanwhile are desperate to address their slump after they went six games without a win following an unbelievable draw against Feyenoord on Tuesday night.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim brings in new Man United rule after Marcus Rashford and Casemiro decision - Manchester Evening News\nRuben Amorim has been in charge of Manchester United for a matter of days and has already implemented a new rule.\n\nManchester United boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly cracking down on squad discipline and has announced that players will no longer be able to use international breaks as an excuse for extra holidays.\n\nAmorim took up his coaching duties at the beginning of the week and found his squad depleted due to many being away playing for their nations. Two players who were not involved for their national teams were Marcus Rashford and Casemiro.\n\nBoth players took the opportunity to travel to the US; Rashford was spotted at an NBA game in Madison Square Garden, while Casemiro visited Disney World in Florida.\n\nWhilst not pointing the finger at Rashford or Casemiro for seizing their break, Amorim clearly stated: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash [Rashford] or Case [Casemiro].\"\n\nThe recent escapades of Rashford and Casemiro were met with criticism from ex-United stalwart Gary Neville, who voiced concerns about the poor optics and questioned whether trips abroad are the best way for players to recuperate amidst difficult times at the club.\n\nHe stated: \"I'm not that wound up about [Marcus] Rashford and Casemiro going over to the United States, but what I'm asking is, if you've got a four-day break, Portland is a 12-hour flight and an eight-hour time difference, your jetlag is bad, and you feel a bit [rough].\n\n\"They went to Portland, and I'm asking the question based on professionalism – you're playing badly, the team are losing, your 13th in the league, and there is a new manager coming in – would you choose that trip as a break to recharge your batteries? That's not a recharging trip. It's not right that.\"\n\nAmorim commented on the changes he plans to make: \"Us as a club have to set the standards and have to manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"\n\nAmorim, known for his attention to detail, has prohibited his coaches from giving out complex instructions. The former Sporting Lisbon boss believes that if he can't explain a particular idea in a single sentence, it shouldn't be communicated until it's simplified.",

Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\n\n\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things.\n\n\"After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\n\n\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good.\n\n\"But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\"\n\nAfter registering an incredible 124 goals or assists in 166 appearances at Arsenal, Sanchez managed only 14 in 45 appearances for United.\n\nHaving played just one season with the Red Devils, he joined Serie A side [Inter Milan](https://www.sportbible.com/inter-milan) on a season-long loan in 2018/19 before securing a permanent move to the club the following summer.",

I'm disappointed, but we will see.\"\n\nOf course, a lot has happened in the days that followed, [Jamie Carragher expressed how he was ‘disappointed’](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/champions-league/liverpool-mo-salah-contract-jamie-carragher-475131-20241125) by Salah’s remarks, and the Egyptian started in Liverpool’s 2-0 win against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday – Salah missed a second-half penalty.\n\nHowever, on Friday, his latest social media post got Liverpool fans thinking.\n\nThe former Chelsea man posted a story to Instagram which showed him walking towards Liverpool’s ‘AXA Training Centre’ located in Kirkby, Liverpool.\n\nOf course, exactly what the photograph means is up for debate, but Liverpool fans were quick to give their thoughts on social media.\n\nOne said: “Sign the contract, big boy.”\n\nAnother added: “Ready to sign a new contract.”\n\nWith a third saying: “Mo just has that aura around him. This man needs to be paid!”\n\nA fourth explained: “He’s trying to use leverage to get the best deal. Both sides are clearly signalling they want to make a deal so it will very likely happen.”\n\nSalah will likely start the Premier League match against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday – a win would send the Reds 11 points clear of Pep Guardiola’s side.",

        "article_text": "Leny Yoro has been sidelined for four months and is still yet to make his debut from Man United since arriving from Lille.\n\nManchester United defender Leny Yoro is still not training in every first team session.\n\nYoro was involved in new head coach Ruben Amorim's first team training session last Monday but he was absent from the travelling squad for the Premier League draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 19-year-old was missing again for United's session on Wednesday ahead of their Europa League tie against Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford tomorrow night.\n\nUnited sources say Yoro was on a designated recovery day as he continues his rehabilitation from a fractured metatarsal. Yoro has been sidelined since he was forced off in United's pre-season friendly defeat to Arsenal on July 26.\n\nYoro was provisionally due to start for the Under 21s in their National League Cup win at Altrincham last Tuesday but he was withdrawn from the squad.\n\nUnited signed Yoro from Lille for £52.18million rising to £58.91m in July but he only played 80 minutes in the friendlies with Rangers and Arsenal.\n\nFellow centre back Jonny Evans also did not train as his conditioning is carefully managed. Evans, who turns 37 in January, started at Portman Road and came off early in the second half.\n\n16-year-old centre back Godwill Kukonki trained with United again on Wednesday and the squad welcomed back Harry Maguire (calf) and Lisandro Martinez (back) from injury.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United could be set for a busy start to the New Year when the transfer window officially opens.\n\nUnited have already been linked with several potential new signings ahead of the January window. Ruben Amorim is the club's new head coach and will be busy assessing the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag over the next few weeks.\n\nIt remains to be seen what players, if any, United will try and sign in January to strengthen their squad for the second half of the season. For the time being, though, rumours are continuing to swirl that it could be a busy month at Old Trafford.\n\nHere, MEN Sport takes a look at some of the latest United transfer news and gossip that have generated headlines over the last 24 hours.\n\n**READ MORE:** **Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**\n\n**READ MORE:** Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update\n\nUnited are being linked with a move for Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. According to Sport Mediaset, the Reds are preparing to submit a contract offer to the Georgia international ahead of a potential move in 2025.\n\nThe report claims that United want to offer Kvaratskhelia a five-year contract that would see him earn approximately £128,000 per week plus bonuses. However, it has not been reported how much United would be prepared to offer Napoli to try and sign the winger.\n\nThe Serie A club are reportedly valuing Kvaratskhelia at €100million (£83.5million). United will apparently face competition from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain for the 23-year-old's signature.\n\nElsewhere, United have reportedly joined the race to sign Wolves star Rayan Ait-Nouri. According to The Sun, United have placed the left-back high on their shortlist of potential transfer targets heading into the January window.\n\nThe report claims that United target Ait-Nouri is weighing up whether or not to pursue a move away from Molineux in 2025. It has been reported that United are determined to sign a left-back in the New Year and that Ait-Nouri fits the bill of the player that would suit Amorim's system.",

        "article_text": "Why Erik ten Hag is in a more secure position than previous Manchester United managers - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.\n\nBy\n\nSamuel Luckhurst Chief Manchester United writer\n\n06:00, 22 DEC 2023\n\nOf the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.\n\nThe misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.\n\nOf the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.\n\nDe Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.\n\nAs costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games. That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.\n\nThere are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.\n\nOnly one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.\n\nThe difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.\n\nTen Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.\n\nThere is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.\n\nPotter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.\n\nFan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.\n\nUnited bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.\n\nHalf-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.\n\nThat was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United transfer pattern emerges as Ruben Amorim searches for dream signing - Sean McCormick - Manchester Evening News\n\nUnited are in the market for a new left-wing-back and a pattern is emerging on their search\n\nAs Manchester United continue to get to grips with Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 formation, it is clear that certain positions will need to be strengthened in the transfer market.\n\nDiogo Dalot started as a left-wing-back in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town and United have been without a natural left-sided full-back since February.\n\nHowever, despite both Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia returning to the squad on Sunday after lengthy injury absences, it is clear that United need to add competition at left-wing-back so they do not need to rely on either of those players given their injury records.\n\nBoth could yet thrive under Amorim but a new left-wing-back has emerged as a clear transfer priority for the new United manager.\n\nAs such, the links are already pouring in over who United could make a move for. Having been linked with the likes of Ben Chilwell, Milos Kerkez and Marcos Alonso in the summer, the profile of left-wing-back United are now said to be targeting is a lot different.\n\nBayern Munich's Alphonso Davies has emerged as the most ambitious target. The Canada international is available on a free transfer next summer and all signs suggest he won't pen a new deal at the Allianz Arena.\n\nReal Madrid have long been linked with the 24-year-old and they remain favourites for his signature. But United have been credited with an interest and it remains to be seen whether the Amorim project can tempt him to make the move to the Premier League.\n\nSimilarly, AC Milan's French international left-back Theo Hernandez has also been linked with a move to United today. The 27-year-old is out of contract in 2026 and while he does not commit his future to the San Siro he could well be available for a cut-price fee.\n\nBenfica's Alvaro Carreras has been linked with a sensational return to Old Trafford, too, just months after making the move to the Portuguese giants from United on a permanent basis.\n\nThe Spanish under-21 international has impressed in Portugal and is a player Amorim knows well. His £16.7million buyback clause would hardly break the bank but would improve United with a player who has now proven himself at the top level of European football.\n\nUnlike the summer links with Chilwell and Alonso, players whose best years are arguably behind them, United are now being linked with the best and most promising left-wing-backs in Europe.\n\nAll three players would be prudent signings, too, given their contract status, and if United can take advantage to sign just one of their purported targets, it would send a sign that they are no longer a club that overspends on talent but are a club that identifies opportunities in the market and exploits them.",

Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n    *   On fellow defender Lenny Yoro's availability: \"He is available to train but we are working on his fitness, which is important. He is a young guy. We believe in him a lot and we are trying to prepare the best way.\"\n    *   On his first match at Old Trafford: \"Everybody has said it will be a special time. Before the match it will be like a new sensation, but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that match.\"\n    *   Amorim confirmed that there will be squad rotation for Thursday's match: \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games. We are in the beginning of something. They have to feel that they are part of the team.\"\n    *   On Thursday's opponents: \"I'm expecting a very good team, they can win the Norwegian league this week. They run a lot and that is a very good thing for us because we need to improve that. They have some special players on the wings and they can play in the pockets very well.\"\n    *   Amorim was asked if he will ever change his formation: \"We have to do it. When I talk about our structure, I believe we can play in different systems. Nowadays, every team changes their dynamic so we will adapt to that. Right now, we are starting with the beginning and after that we will change different things.\"\n    *   On the lack of goalscorers in recent years: \"Of course there is a concern, but we have to improve as a team. But we have quality players who can score lots of goals. Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Rashford will score more goals.\"\n    *   On helping Rashford find his best form: \"I will try to help him. It wasn't the best position for him, we will try to find the right solution for him. He has to be the first one to really want it.\"\n\n2.  **Pat Nevin**  \n    Former footballer and presenter\n\n    After Liverpool's win at Southampton, all eyes shifted to the real story on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond.\n\n    Certainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\n\n    The fact that they were not demonstrably better than promoted Ipswich, after a fabulous start, shows the road is long, and he will need some time, probably quite a lot.\n\n    Will it be a match made in heaven? It has more chance than Steve Cooper had at Leicester. If ever there was a poisoned chalice, this was it for the former Nottingham Forest manager, that was a union doomed to failure.",

(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images.)\n\nManchester United supporters group The 1958 have announced they will stage a peaceful protest against increased ticket prices alongside Everton supporters ahead of Sunday's Premier League fixture at Old Trafford.\n\nAs a member of the Football Supporters' Association (FSA), The 1958 will stand side-by-side with Everton supporters to protest against the decision that saw 19 of the 20 Premier League clubs increase their season ticket prices for this campaign.\n\nA campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty' has been created, and United and Everton fans will display an FSA banner on the Old Trafford forecourt, next to the United Trinity statue, at 12.30pm on Sunday lunchtime.\n\nThe 1958 have also confirmed that both Liverpool and Manchester City supporters will stage their own protest ahead of their respective clubs going head-to-head at Anfield later in the day.\n\nA statement issued by The 1958 said: \"With 19 out of 20 Premier League clubs increasing ticket prices this season, FC58, Everton, Liverpool and City supporters will display the FSA banner to raise awareness that any future season ticket price increases, removal of concessions and treating match-going supporters as an easy target to make quick revenues will not be tolerated.\n\n\"With the discussions around the rebuild or redevelopment of Old Trafford, we need to send a message to the club that we are laser-focused on keeping football affordable and looking after our loyal match-going fanbase.\n\n\"Manchester United have announced that they will be selling tickets to members for the remainder of the season at a minimum of £66 irrespective of whether you are under 16, youth, OAP or disabled. Which is a clear exploitation of the loyal fan base and their first move towards dynamic pricing.\"\n\nFC58 added that meaningful changes will 'only happen if supporters work together'.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n*   [Man arrested over viral 'Manchester nightlife' clips after Manchester Evening News investigation](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/man-arrested-over-viral-manchester-30460922?int_source=nba)\n*   [Woman found dead in house as detectives make murder arrests](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/woman-found-dead-house-detectives-30461697?int_source=nba)\n*   [Hotel Chocolat Christmas chocolate heavily reduced at one online retailer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/hotel-chocolat-christmas-chocolate-heavily-30447966?int_source=nba)\n*   [Giant bags of Lindt truffles reduced to cheaper than Tesco price are 'perfect' for Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/giant-bags-lindt-truffles-reduced-30431593?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United get double injury boost ahead of Europa League fixture vs Bodo/Glimt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-double-injury-boost-30461917?int_source=nba)",

        "article_text": "Man United handed unlikely Viktor Gyokeres transfer boost after Gabriel celebration drama - Jack Flintham - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have been linked with a move for Viktor Gyokeres since Ruben Amorim's move to Old Trafford was confirmed at the beginning of November.\n\nFine lines often secure transfers in football and Manchester United are no strangers to this practice.\n\nWho could forget Dimitar Berbatov choosing United when seemingly certain to move to Manchester City after Sir Alex Ferguson's last-minute intervention? Or, Alan Shearer shopping for houses in Manchester only to pull the plug on a United move and return to Newcastle instead.\n\nOver the course of a club's history, they will be the beneficiaries or the victims of these fine lines over and over again. However, it is rare that a team can benefit passively from the acts of a third party but United could become the exception to that rule.\n\nIt is no secret that United and Arsenal both have Viktor Gyokeres on their radars. The Gunners' interest is more long-term having been interested in him since the summer while speculation surrounding the Reds arose following the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mikel Arteta's side were able to witness Gyokeres' talents first-hand in the Champions League but it was a night for him to forget as the Swede's side lost 5-1. Insult would be added to injury for the striker in first-half stoppage time when Arsenal defender Gabriel chose to perform the striker's celebration as the Gunners raced into a 3-0 lead.\n\nGyokeres did not notice it at the time but seemed less than impressed when informed of it. \"Gabriel’s celebration? He’s welcome to steal it if he can’t create his own celebration,\" he told reporters post-match.\n\nThe actions of both players may have come in the heat of the moment but it is unlikely that Gabriel's actions will have done anything to warm the Swede towards signing for Arsenal. Footballers can be overly protective about their celebrations and players stealing them can often be seen as disrespectful. As such, United could use the Arsenal defender's actions to prove to Gyokeres that Old Trafford would be a better home for him come next summer. They were already the favourites prior to Gabriel's gesture, now Amorim's hand has been strengthened further.",

        "article_text": "Beautiful, elegant and ready to rock and roll - Man United can unleash Ruben Amorim's dream player - Manchester Evening News\n\nLeny Yoro is set for his Manchester United debut under Ruben Amorim.\n\nBy Alex James 09:12, 27 NOV 2024\n\nRuben Amorim can't change too much too quickly at Manchester United but it's clear the future will have a different look to the present.\n\nA lack of training time hampered Amorim's ability to make wholesale changes for his first game in charge at Ipswich but his favoured 3-4-3 set-up was on show and the personnel will surely be amended over the coming weeks.\n\nThe likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, and Lisandro Martinez will surely feature regularly but it's a Premier League rookie generating perhaps the most excitement. Leny Yoro arrived at Old Trafford in the summer from Lille where he had forged a reputation that belied his tender years. Still only 19, he has more than 50 senior games under his belt and attracted the attention of Real Madrid before moving to Old Trafford.\n\nAn injury in pre-season has hampered his progress but he is now fit and could be included in a matchday squad for the first time as a United player when Bodo Glimt visit in the Europa League on Thursday. Indeed, a first start surely isn't too far away for a player who possesses the characteristics Amorim strives for in his defence.\n\nHis passing range and technical ability mark him out as a player who can help United progress from the back in the way Amorim's Sporting often did. Physically, he will only improve with age and experience and mentally he has already proven he is ready for the top having broken through at Lille as a 16-year-old.\n\n“In all my years as a coach, I’ve never seen such a young player with so much maturity,” said his Lille manager Paolo Fonseca. “He has so much class. So much elegance. He’s a beautiful player.\n\n“Leny at that time was still 16 and the idea then was that it would just be for pre-season. After just two days I said, ‘No, no he will stay with us here’. For me, players don’t have age if they have talent. In some cases, like with Leny, it was so easy to understand that he would be important to the team.”\n\nExpectations are high for Yoro but he will be afforded patience to settle into a new environment and new league. But that shouldn't temper excitement around a player who could be a mainstay of the United backline for years to come.\n\nIndeed a man who fulfilled that exact role is predicting big things of Yoro. \"You've got all the potential, you've got all the tools, man, you've got everything there, ready to rock and roll to go and make a big impact at this club.\"",

        "article_headline": "Ruben Amorim must include two benched players in his Manchester United strongest XI",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim must include two benched players in his Manchester United strongest XI - Steven Railston - Manchester Evening News\n\nThe games are about to come quick and fast for Man Utd and Ruben Amorim must settle on his best midfield.\n\nConsidering Ruben Amorim wants to play \"intense football\", it was a surprise to see him start two 32-year-old midfielders in his first game in charge of Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nChristian Eriksen and Casemiro received the nod against Ipswich Town and Jamie Carragher pointed out the latter's lack of intensity in his analysis on Monday Night Football. You'll rarely hear United fans listening to Carragher but his analysis segments on Sky Sports are informative and he broke down Amorim's tactics from the draw against Ipswich Town.\n\nCarragher showed why having players who produce intensity in midfield is so important to his system - they are needed to press - and also outlined good and bad examples of the players attempting to deliver Amorim's vision against Ipswich.\n\nThe expectation was Amorim would start Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte, who seemed like the logical pairing, so the decision to start Casemiro and Eriksen seemed a tad strange.\n\nBefore the game, Amorim explained his team and said: \"I have tried to use all the training [sessions] that we had during this week. So we had, for example, more time to train with Casemiro - we had Ugarte one day to train. So we try to use the players that I have passed more information to.\n\n\"I think that is key. You will see some changes, not big changes. It is impossible to do it in two trainings, but you will see some details in the team, I hope, that can show a little bit of the new idea.\"\n\nThat interview with Amorim helped clarify his midfield selection but United's new head coach will have overseen another three sessions by the time of the Bodo/Glimt game at Old Trafford on Thursday night, which means Ugarte and Mainoo have to come into the side.\n\nAlthough there were some positives to take from Sunday's draw against Ipswich, the performance in the second half was poor and Amorim can't start Casemiro and Eriksen again. He needs to make changes to face Bodo/Glimt and starting Mainoo and Ugarte is logical. Mainoo returned to training after recovering from a muscle injury nine days ago - he is fit and ready to start - and Ugarte has had a few more training sessions after returning from international duty.\n\nUgarte came on from the bench at the weekend but Mainoo was an unused substitute and looked quite disappointed as he strolled through the mixed zone to leave Portman Road.\n\nAnyone suggesting Mainoo is facing a fight to get back into the line-up has succumb to recency bias. Mainoo didn't have the best start to the campaign, that is true, but he was playing in a flawed tactical system and clearly needed a rest after a gruelling first full season in senior football.\n\nAfter Mainoo made his full Premier League debut at Goodison Park last term, he was involved in practically every game and was then called up to England's squad for Euro 2024. His injury was probably seen as a blessing in disguise because it gave him time to recharge. The 19-year-old should get back to his best in the coming weeks and it's a no-brainer to start him against Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League, which should be the perfect fixture to return in.\n\nMainoo is one of the finest young midfielders in the world, United are lucky to have him and he is expected to thrive working with Amorim, who favoured young players at Sporting Lisbon. Ugarte played the best football of his career under Amorim at Sporting and should start alongside him.\n\n**The XI that Amorim should pick against Bodo/Glimt**: Onana, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dalot; Fernandes, Rashford, Garnacho.",

        "article_headline": "Man United 'plotting move' for £50m star who Mo Salah's made his feelings clear about",
        "article_text": "Manchester United are reportedly ready to rival Liverpool for the signature of Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who has been labelled \"incredible\" by Mohamed Salah.\n\nManchester United are looking to hijack Liverpool's move for Omar Marmoush, who Mohamed Salah has already hailed as \"incredible\".\n\nThe Eintracht Frankfurt goalscorer has been turning heads this season, netting 11 times in as many Bundesliga games. His prowess in front of goal has catapulted Frankfurt into the thick of an unexpected title race, with the team currently breathing down the neck of table-toppers Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 25-year-old's scintillating run of form hasn't gone unnoticed, with heavyweight clubs across Europe keeping track of his progress. Liverpool are thought to be front-runners, especially with Marmoush's Egyptian team-mate Salah reportedly recommending him to his club – but United are now seemingly in the hunt too.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports Germany, United are monitoring Marmoush's situation closely and are contemplating an approach for him in the January transfer window bid. Frankfurt's asking price reportedly hangs around £50million, but this valuation is poised to inflate if a tug-of-war ensues.\n\nForward Marmoush could be seen as a cheaper alternative to United-linked Viktor Gyokeres, who reportedly has a release clause of £83m. Many are tipping the Red Devils to be active in the January market to afford newly-appointed head coach Ruben Amorim the opportunity to sculpt the squad more to his liking, especially considering his fondness for three-at-the-back systems.\n\nMarmoush can play anywhere across the front three, potentially offering Amorim additional options and adaptability in attack. United could also use his goalscoring prowess, particularly given the recent struggles of Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, and Joshua Zirkzee in front of goal.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, may decide to step up their pursuit of Marmoush should Salah's contract situation worsen. Following Liverpool's 3-2 triumph over Southampton on Sunday, 32-year-old Salah dropped a bombshell by revealing he hadn't been presented with a new contract and felt \"more out than in\".\n\nSalah's future at Anfield has been the subject of speculation for quite some time now. With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, Liverpool could see him leave on a free transfer if they don't tie him down to a new deal soon. However, he's reportedly earning £350,000-a-week and the club are, understandably, reluctant to offer a multi-year deal with the same terms.\n\nWhile Liverpool's interest in Marmoush isn't solely tied to Salah's situation, the prospect of Salah not extending his stay may push the club to secure the Frankfurt star's services sooner rather later. Speaking about his Pharaohs team-mate, Salah told Win Win: \"Omar Marmoush, incredibly talented and currently a key player for his club and the national team.\n\n\"I hope he can stay away from comparisons [to me] because they will keep putting him under constant pressure. People need to stop comparing him to me, saying he's 'the new Salah' and that he'll do what I did or even better, this doesn't help him.\n\n\"You can't compare him to a player who has achieved so much over the years while he's just starting out. Let him live his own experience and enjoy it. He's doing something different, in his own unique way.\"\n\nMarmoush kicked off his career at Egyptian outfit Wadi Degla before joining Wolfsburg in 2017. Following loan spells at St Pauli and Stuttgart, he made a move to Frankfurt in 2023, and scored 17 goals in his debut season.\n\nHe's started the current campaign at even faster pace, with 14 goals in all competitions so far. Marmoush has also been an Egypt regular since 2021, and has 35 caps and six international goals to his name.",

Neville highlighted ongoing issues within the team during a discussion with David Jones and Jamie Carragher in the Sky Sports studio before Monday Night Football, pointing out that these problems haven't suddenly appeared but have been present for months and even the last season and a half.\n\nHe said: \"It's a team that is very difficult to actually like watching, and I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game.

They don't want criticism.\"\n\nDespite acknowledging international duty had limited Amorim's preparation time, Neville was candid in his opinion that Ipswich, struggling near the bottom of the Premier League without any home wins this season, seemed better coached than United. He concluded by expressing his distress over Manchester United's appearance, even within the new system applied for the match.\n\n\"But you watch them play, even yesterday, in the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league,\" Neville added. \"They looked more organised, [like they had a] better coach, they looked like they had more appetite for the game and more enthusiasm.\n\n\"And that's a constant, and it has been a constant, not just, obviously, on Sunday, but a constant for the last year and a half, two years, three years. So we've got a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\"\n\nNeville did not hide his concerns, stressing that the issues at Manchester United weren't new. He continued: \"And it wasn't just a red flag yesterday because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, 10 months, we saw yesterday.\n\n\"With Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well. I think he obviously knew how big a job this was. I think he recognised that yesterday. It will get better in the next few weeks because, like you say, that back five that he picks, and I'm not talking about the actual wing-backs here.\n\n\"I'm talking about the three at the back and the two in midfield. That will become more energetic and better when the personnel changes occur but there's a long way to go. I think Roy [Keane] yesterday said that Manchester United were an average team, and that's being kind.\"",

        "article_text": "Plymouth head coach and former Reds icon Wayne Rooney said his side got what they deserved after they were hammered 6-1 by Norwich.  \nPlymouth head coach Wayne Rooney conceded that his team fully merited their crushing 6-1 defeat at the hands of Norwich. Borja Sainz was in scintillating form, netting a hat-trick as Argyle suffered their third significant away loss in the Championship this season, following previous setbacks at Sheffield Wednesday and Cardiff.\n\n\"We were nowhere near good enough we are down to the bare bones with injuries but that is no excuse,\" Manchester United icon Rooney acknowledged. \"We were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time. You then hope for a reaction in the second half but once they made it 3-1 I thought we went under, which is very disappointing. The players just didn't look like they thought they could get back in it.\"\n\nRooney then didn't mince words about the performance, adding: \"We need to be a lot better than that the next 24-48 hours are not going to be very nice for the players.\" \"I have praised them a lot this season for their performances at home but away needs to much better than this and we have got to get to the bottom of why it keeps happening it can't carry on like this.\"\n\nExpressing empathy for the supporters, he added: \"I just feel sorry for the fans who have come all this way they will be not be pleased with what they have seen tonight.\" The match began with Norwich dominating early on, seizing the lead within two minutes as Sainz scored while Plymouth's offside appeals were ignored.\n\nAfter relentless pressure, Sainz extended his team's lead with a composed finish at the 17-minute mark, but Mustapha Bundu clawed one back for his side just before the break following an intercepted risky pass. The second half saw dominance resume.\n\nShane Duffy notched the third goal with a header from a corner, and Sainz sealed his hat-trick by expertly curling the ball past goalkeeper Daniel Grimshaw later in the half. Subs Anis Ben Slimane and Ante Crnac added gloss to the scoreline with fine strikes towards the end, compounding a tough evening for Rooney's squad.",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has clarified the comments he made after Manchester City’s 3-3 draw against Feyenoord on Tuesday evening.\n\nGuardiola, 53, was visibly frustrated as his side surrendered a three-goal lead in just 15 minutes to continue their poor run of form.\n\nThe draw saw City go 15th in the 36-team Champions League group phase having already dropped points against Inter Milan and Sporting this term.\n\nThe Premier League champions are without a win in their last six games – including five defeats.\n\nPep Guardiola explains face scratches\n\nAfter last night’s game, the Spaniard had visible scratches on his head and nose. He explained how he had got them in his post-match press conference.\n\n\"I cut it with my finger, my nail,” explained the City boss.\n\nHe then continued saying he wanted to “hurt himself”, before laughing.\n\nNow, he has taken to X to address his comments.\n\n\"I was caught off guard with a question at the end of a press conference last night about a scratch which had appeared on my face and explained that a sharp fingernail had accidentally caused this,” read a post to his official X account.\n\n“My answer was in no way intended to make light of the very serious issue of self harm.\n\n“I know that many people struggle with mental health issues every day, and I would like to take this moment to highlight one of the ways in people can seek help, by calling the Samaritans hotline on 116 123 or emailing jo@samaritans.org.”\n\nGuardiola was less than pleased with his side's lacklustre performance but stressed how his players were \"desperate\" to win against Sporting.\n\n“They feel it, they are desperate to win, that’s why they play the way they play,” the City boss said.\n\n“They played really good in many aspects. How many chances we conceded but again three goals. We made 26 shots against Spurs and lost 4-0.\n\n“We are a team that has conceded so few goals in eight or nine years. We are always so stable and able to defend well and now it’s not happening.\n\n“The game was 3-0 and even more, I don’t remember much - maybe one shot. We cannot close the games and every time they arrive they score.”\n\nThe 53-year-old will no doubt already be planning for his side's trip to Anfield, where they will face Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday afternoon.\n\nCity currently trail Arne Slot's side by eight points and will hoping to reduce the gap this weekend.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim could be set to reunite with four of his former Sporting players, according to reports.\n\nAmorim, 39, took charge of his first game as United head coach last Sunday as he saw his side play out a 1-1 draw at Portman Road against Ipswich.\n\nAlthough he employed his usual 3-4-3 formation, it was clear that the Red Devils’ players had not been entirely well-drilled in his playing style as of yet.\n\nBut, as he said in his first interview when he arrived at Old Trafford, this may take “time” to work.\n\nWhen speaking after Sunday’s match, Amorim even said that his team will need to “suffer”.\n\n“They need time to have some fluidity,” he explained.\n\n“I know it’s frustrating for the fans, but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period. This will take time.”\n\nBut this ‘suffering’ may well be eased in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Mail, United had scouts at Sporting’s 5-1 defeat against Arsenal on Tuesday, with Manchester City among several Premier League clubs 'watching' at the Estadio Jose Alvalade stadium.\n\nThe report suggests that United have ‘made it their priority’ to sign in form Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nThe Swede has netted 67 times in 69 appearances for Sporting since signing from Coventry City in 2023, having scored 24 times in just 20 games so far this term.\n\nAmorim has ‘promised’ not to take players from his old club in January, but this could depend on how United are performing come the transfer window.\n\nPSG left-back Nuno Mendes may also be an option for United.\n\nMendes played under Amorim at Sporting between 2020 and 2022.\n\nGeovany Quenda, 17, and Pedro Goncalves, 26, have also been linked with a potential move to United.\n\nAmorim’s former club are ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign Quenda, according to A BOLA.\n\nAs for Goncalves, he mostly played on the left of a front-three under Amorim – the position Alejandro Garnacho was used in during the draw at Ipswich. The Portugal international’s Sporting contract is set to run until June 2027 with the player valued at around €32.00m (£26.7m) by Transfermarkt.",

        "article_text": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991) | Manchester United | The Guardian\n===============\n\nIt may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul\n\nYes, this story is free\n-----------------------\n\nWhy the Guardian has no paywall\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. \n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than _that_!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

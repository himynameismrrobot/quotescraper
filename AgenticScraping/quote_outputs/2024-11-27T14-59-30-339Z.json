        "article_text": "### Manchester United\n\n#### Latest updates\n\n**Josh Lobley**  \nBBC Sport Journalist\n\nManchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Europa League game against Bodo/Glimt.\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\n- He was asked if Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez will be available for Thursday's match: \"Not Harry. Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n\n- On fellow defender Lenny Yoro's availability: \"He is available to train but we are working on his fitness, which is important. He is a young guy. We believe in him a lot and we are trying to prepare the best way.\"\n\n- On his first match at Old Trafford: \"Everybody has said it will be a special time. Before the match it will be like a new sensation, but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that match.\"\n\n- Amorim confirmed that there will be squad rotation for Thursday's match: \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games. We are in the beginning of something. They have to feel that they are part of the team.\"\n\n- On Thursday's opponents: \"I'm expecting a very good team, they can win the [Norwegian] league this week. They run a lot and that is a very good thing for us because we need to improve that. They have some special players on the wings and they can play in the pockets very well.\"\n\n- Amorim was asked if he will ever change his formation: \"We have to do it. When I talk about our structure, I believe we can play in different systems. Nowadays, every team changes their dynamic so we will adapt to that. Right now, we are starting with the beginning and after that we will change different things.\"\n\n- On the lack of goalscorers in recent years: \"Of course there is a concern, but we have to improve as a team. But we have quality players who can score lots of goals. Rasmus [Hojlund] Joshua [Zirkzee] and Rashford will score more goals.\"\n\n- On helping Rashford find his best form: \"I will try to help him. It wasn't the best position for him [against Ipswich], we will try to find the right solution for him. He has to be the first one to really want it.\"\n\n**Pat Nevin**  \nFormer footballer and presenter\n\nAfter Liverpool's win at Southampton, all eyes shifted to the real story on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond.\n\nCertainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\n\nThe fact that they were not demonstrably better than promoted Ipswich, after a fabulous start, shows the road is long, and he will need some time, probably quite a lot.\n\nWill it be a match made in heaven? It has more chance than Steve Cooper had at Leicester. If ever there was a poisoned chalice, this was it for the former Nottingham Forest manager, that was a union doomed to failure.\n\n**Dale O'Donnell**  \nFan writer\n\nAmad Diallo has been working his way into Manchester United’s plans, but now is the time for the winger to stake his importance to Ruben Amorim.\n\nLast Sunday, we saw Amad deployed as one of two wing-back options in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town.\n\nAmorim had just two training sessions with his matchday squad to prepare his players for their first game.\n\nThe Portuguese coach wasted no time implementing his preferred 3-4-3 formation, with Diogo Dalot named as the opposite wing-back.\n\nAfter the first two minutes, I thought ‘right, this is clicking instantly’ as Amad went on a sublime driving solo run down the right flank before setting up Marcus Rashford with a brilliant cross.\n\nThe end result didn’t go United’s way but this was an instant example of the damage Amad can inflict in wide areas as he beat two Ipswich players on his travels.\n\nWhen I watch United, I want our wide players hurting teams down the flanks, and Amad has the energy to be a threat throughout games. That is why Amorim will have a place for the 22-year-old.\n\nAs a wing-back, Amad is also expected to carry out defensive duties, and he was kept busy in that department at Portman Road with 71 touches of the ball. He won five of his eight duels and made five clearances against the Tractor Boys.\n\nAmad could be used as a number 10 in Amorim’s system – alongside Bruno Fernandes – as he has energy in abundance to carry out that role if required, as seen during his stint at Sunderland under Tony Mowbray.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international has been knocking on the door at United for some time, but he deserves the opportunities he’s got this season.\n\nAfter a match-winning display against PAOK in the Champions League earlier this month, there is reason to believe Amad will become an important player under Amorim at United.\n\nFurther proof that hard work pays off.\n\n**Henry Brownsey**  \nBBC Sport journalist\n\nAs Ed Sheeran made some headlines this week.\n\nManchester United fans hope Ruben Amorim will be 'The Man' but he was hoping for more points than just 'One'.\n\nLeicester are looking for a 'New Man' as Cooper's reign lasted 157 days.\n\nWolves' ended their 'Bad Habits' with their first away win since February.\n\nTottenham achieved a nearly 'Perfect' performance and an even better 'Photograph'.\n\nLiverpool fans wonder what life could be like without the 'Shape of You'.\n\nDespite Alexander Isak not asking the Newcastle fans to 'Give me Love' they clearly showed that they 'Remember the Name.'\n\nAnd the Toon Army will be hoping Monday's loss was just a 'Small Bump'.\n\n**Alex Turk**  \nFan writer\n\nWhy did Manchester United not look as good as Sporting against Ipswich Town on Sunday? Can this Ruben Amorim fella walk the walk as well as he talks the talk? How is this 3-4-3 system going to click?\n\nThose would be questions of an individual needing to understand the reality of the situation Amorim has inherited from Erik ten Hag.\n\nSuch a drastic change of vision would have been challenging to instil with a full pre-season at his disposal. United visited Portman Road with two training sessions in the tank.\n\nAmorim understands that only wins will buy him time, but that has not deterred his repeated cries for patience.\n\nAs long as he persists with his three-at-the-back philosophy and his guarantee of a clear identity - something United have missed for far too long - supporters will offer the patience he desires.\n\nNot much sense is required to understand why the Red Devils did not enjoy a winning start to life under Amorim at Ipswich.\n\nIt was simple. The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\n\nAmorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\n\nUnited lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\n\nAmorim cannot be judged this early on.\n\nI loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\n\nTen Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\n\nThis time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\n\n**Simon Stone**  \nChief football news reporter\n\nManchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been given the Player Impact Award by international players' union Fifpro for his charity work.\n\nOnana set up the Andre Onana Foundation to provide free medical care and surgeries for underprivileged children and adults in Cameroon and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Doctors have performed more than 1,200 operations in the past three years.\n\nOnana, 28, said he felt \"a responsibility to give back and help others\".\n\n**22 November 2024**\n",

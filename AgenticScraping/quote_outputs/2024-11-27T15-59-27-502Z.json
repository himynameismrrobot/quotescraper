Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes says he is confident of fitting in to Ruben Amorim's new system at Old Trafford.\n\nHis fellow countryman is the third permanent manager Fernandes has played under since signing for the Red Devils in 2020, plus nine months under interim Ralf Rangnick.\n\n\"You always have to adapt to different ideas and positions, even sometimes playing in the same system you have to adapt to different ideas of playing,\" said Fernandes before Thursday's Europa League game against Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt.\n\n\"It is not difficult for me to adapt in any position. I am really well aware of that.\n\n\"During training I try to absorb everything, from every position. I try to have an understanding of the game because being the captain, the manager cannot always give the message from the bench to the pitch. As captain, you have to try to resolve the situation together with your team-mates. Having knowledge of every position is my role.\"\n\n3.  **Josh Lobley**  BBC Sport Journalist\n\nManchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Europa League game against Bodo/Glimt.\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\n*   He was asked if Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez will be available for Thursday's match: \"Not Harry. Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready.\"\n*   On his first match at Old Trafford: \"Everybody has said it will be a special time. Before the match it will be like a new sensation, but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that match.\"\n*   Amorim confirmed that there will be squad rotation for Thursday's match: \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games. We are in the beginning of something. They have to feel that they are part of the team.\"\n*   On Thursday's opponents: \"I'm expecting a very good team, they can win the [Norwegian] league this week. They run a lot and that is a very good thing for us because we need to improve that. They have some special players on the wings and they can play in the pockets very well.\"\n*   On the lack of goalscorers in recent years: \"Of course there is a concern, but we have to improve as a team. But we have quality players who can score lots of goals. Rasmus [Hojlund] Joshua [Zirkzee] and Rashford will score more goals.\"\n*   On helping Rashford find his best form: \"I will try to help him. It wasn't the best position for him [against Ipswich], we will try to find the right solution for him. He has to be the first one to really want it.\"\n\n4.  **Phil McNulty** BBC Sport's chief football writer has been answering your questions.\n\nRuben Amorim made a lot of comments after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \"suffer\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\n\nSo yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\n\nWhat we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\n\nI think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw by Ipswich Town on Sunday as Ruben Amorim's side were pegged back in the Premier League.\n\nBy Jack Flintham Sport Central Audience Writer\n\n12:00, 27 NOV 2024\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim reportedly continued to push for a left-back in the January transfer window following the draw with Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe Reds got off to the best possible start in Suffolk with Marcus Rashford scoring inside 90 seconds at Portman Road. However, United struggled to regain a hold of the fixture after that with the Tractor Boys coming close on a number of occasions before Omari Hutchinson's deflected strike finally beat Andre Onana.\n\nIn the end, the Reds had to settle for a point with expectations high that the forthcoming clashes at Old Trafford against Bodo/Glimt and Everton will see Amorim bag his first victory. From Amorim's perspective, it appears he believes there is plenty of work to be done in the transfer market to return better results for United.\n\nSpeaking to GiveMeSport, journalist Fabrizio Romano understands that Amorim insisted upon a new left-back in January to strengthen his squad. \"Now I am in the position to confirm, once again, that Manchester United will sign a new left-back, left wing-back, let's call him as you prefer, now Ruben Amorim is playing with the back three,\" he explained.\n\n\"From what I'm hearing, even after the Ipswich game, the message from Ruben Amorim to Manchester United management is, we need a player in that position in 2025. Could be January, could be summer, based on opportunities, based on price, based on several factors, but Man United want to go for a player in that position.\"\n\nCurrently, United have two recognised left-backs on their books. Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia have both struggled with long-term injuries in recent years and there are question marks as to whether they can remain fit to play long-term under Amorim.\n\nNoussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot have both been used on the left in their absence but they would prefer to play on the right of defence. On Sunday, Dalot was used on the left while Amad was utilised on the right.",

        "article_text": "Geovany Quenda has quickly made his mark at Sporting Lisbon. (Image: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images.)\n\nFormer Sporting Lisbon academy coach Fabio Roque has compared Manchester United transfer target Geovany Quenda with Arsenal ace Bukayo Saka.\n\nAs reported by the _Manchester Evening News_ earlier this month, United have been tracking the 17-year-old since the beginning of the season. It is understood Sporting are already anticipating receiving a bid from the Reds for his signature.\n\nQuenda was promoted to the Sporting first-team at the start of this season by now-United head coach Ruben Amorim. The teenager quickly established himself as a regular starter, occupying the right-sided wing-back role.\n\nQuenda, who is left-footed, is perfect for the role, meaning he would be comfortable with stepping into it at Old Trafford should United swoop for his signature in the coming months. And for Roque, Quenda has the potential to put a stamp on football unlike anyone else has done previously.\n\n\"He is so committed in defensive moments and defensive duels,\" Roque told Sky Sports. \"He plays so well there because the space that he covers on the field is huge.\n\n\"Geo is so demanding with himself in the defensive moments. To close, to recover fast, to win the defensive duels for his teammates. It reminds me of Bukayo Saka in the beginning of his career when he played as a full-back.\"\n\nQuenda, who was named in the senior Portugal squad for the very first time during the international break earlier this month, is considered as one of the best players of his generation by Roque.\n\nRoque continued: \"There is only one Geovany Quenda. He is different from any other player I trained. He can create a mark on football that is totally different.\n\n\"We are talking about, with Lamine Yamal and Estevao Willian, probably the best players in that generation born in 2007.\"\n\nRoque has also said that Quenda's character and mentality has been key in his sharp rise, adding: \"His personality is one of the biggest reasons he is doing what he is doing now.\n\n\"The talent has to be there, but having the capacity to understand where you are and to seek out those challenges all the time is what makes the difference for Quenda.\"",

        "article_text": "**A significant update in the case surrounding Manchester City's alleged 115 breaches of financial rules has been released.**\n\nCity, who strenuously deny any wrongdoing, were charged by the Premier League with the breaches - a minority of which also relate to UEFA rules - back in February 2023.\n\nA private hearing into the case began in September after lengthy delays, and was expected to take around 10 weeks.\n\nAs a result, there have been few updates on the case in recent weeks as both sides argue their positions out of the public eye.\n\nPenalties for City if found guilty include significant fines, points deductions or even relegation, with a verdict not expected before the end of the season.\n\nBut a fresh update on the timescale for the final decision has been released.\n\nAccording to [The Lawyer](https://www.thelawyer.com/the-hearing-the-end-is-in-sight-for-manchester-city-case/), there are said to have been private admissions that a verdict may not be reached by the end of the 2024/25 season, with the case potentially dragging on into the beginning of the 2025/26 campaign.\n\nIt is claimed that a judgment and possible appeal relating to the hearing, which is scheduled to be completed in mid-December, could now '[take months](https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/manchester-city-115-financial-charges-beyond-end-season-8qds5d0nk)'.\n\nThat is because the hearing, which is taking place at a centre in London, has been paused while both City and the Premier League prepare closing arguments.\n\nIt is added that once those arguments start in early to mid-December, it could take three months or more before the three-man commission reaches a verdict. Time would then be allotted for the preparation of appeals.\n\n**More to follow...**",

        "article_text": "Lionel Messi admits Barcelona 'hated' one Premier League club even more than Real Madrid - Premier League - SPORTbible\n===============\n\n**Lionel Messi has previously admitted that Barcelona players \"hated\" a Premier League club more than bitter rivals Real Madrid – and it was something he \"never thought\" he would say.**\n\nThe Argentine was only a teenager when he decided to go public with the comments during an interview with the News of the World in 2005.\n\nAt the time, there was bad blood between [Barcelona](https://www.sportbible.com/barcelona) and [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) after the Blues produced a memorable comeback at Stamford Bridge in what was a dramatic Champions League last-16 clash.\n\nA week earlier, [Jose Mourinho](https://www.sportbible.com/jose-mourinho) made some not-so-subtle comments about referee Anders Frisk after Didier Drogba was controversially sent off in the first leg.\n\nThe two-legged clash left a bitter taste in the mouth of Barcelona players. In fact, ahead of their last-16 clash in 2006, an 18-year-old [Messi](https://www.sportbible.com/lionel-messi) was vocal about Chelsea.\n\n\"There are \\[Barcelona\\] players here who hate Chelsea more than [Real Madrid](https://www.sportbible.com/real-madrid),\" he said.\n\n\"I never thought I would hear myself say that. I also never thought I would see something worse than the Boca and River Plate rivalry or Brazil vs Argentina - but this is.\n\n\"We would rather play Arsenal, [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"\n\nMessi would go on to produce a superb display for the Catalan side, despite being hacked down by Chelsea defender Asier Del Horno, who was sent off for a shocking challenge on the Argentine.\n\nAn own goal from John Terry and a late strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a first leg advantage before they knocked Jose Mourinho's side out following a 1-1 draw at the Camp Nou.\n\nBarca would lift the [Champions League](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league) that year after Juliano Belletti scored a late winner at the Stade de France against Arsenal.\n\nMessi later recalled a 2012 Champions League defeat to Chelsea as being one of his biggest regrets in a Barcelona shirt.\n\n“I would have liked to have tried to win another Champions League,\" he said in 2021, when he announced his decision to leave Barca.\n\n“We got knocked out in the semi-final's by Liverpool which stopped us getting to another final. We got to the semi-final with Chelsea with Pep \\[Guardiola\\], they prevented us from getting to another final.\n\n“And I think there could have been another time where we could have won another Champions League.”",

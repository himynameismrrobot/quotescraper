      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho given his nationality and success in Portugal, but the new Manchester United boss was keen to play down comparisons when he met the British media on Friday.\n\nMourinho spent two-and-a-half-years at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League following his appointment in 2016. He also sent compatriot Amorim a message to congratulate him on his appointment as successor to Erik ten Hag at United.\n\n\"I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto. \"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere. It's not the same thing. I'm different to Mourinho. He was European champion, I am not.\n\n\"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n\n\"Their young guys were [Frank] Lampard and these kind of players. Nowadays it's so much different. I think I'm the right person for now.\"\n\nRuben Amorim's arrival as Manchester United head coach is expected to see tactical changes, including a switch to three at the back. But which players are set to benefit most?\n\nUnited fan Adam McKola tells The Football News Show why he feels Amorim sticking to his style of football can bring the best out of the likes of Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.\n\nThis was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\".\n\nBut he also acknowledged the scale of the task he faces here after years of decline, and the need for his team to improve. However, he also firmly rejected the suggestion that this was \"the impossible job\". \"Of course not,\" he said.\n\nHe has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required. As the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it.\n\nAt the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\nNew Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.\n\nSpeaking at his first news conference as United boss, on Friday, the 39-year-old said: \"I’m a little bit of a dreamer. I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n\n\"You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\"\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag. Asked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing.\n\n\"I don’t know about repair,\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try and win the title. It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\n\nAmorim takes charge of United for the first time on Sunday, at Ipswich Town (16:30 GMT).",

      "headline": "'I can be ruthless' - Ruben Amorim fires warning that cannot be ignored at Manchester United",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim held his first Man Utd press conference on Friday and made a strong impression at Carrington. \"I can be ruthless when I have to be,\" said Ruben Amorim on Friday afternoon. Manchester United's new head coach was introduced to the press for the first time and made a convincing start to his media duties. Amorim usually has a smile on his face but warned he is not a soft touch. \"There is some places to have fun and some places to work hard,\" he explained. \"I’m not like that kind of guy who wants to show he’s the boss. I think they will feel it in the small details, that I can be the smiling one but then when we have a job to do, I will be a different person and they understand that.\"\n\nAlthough there has been a wide smile on Amorim's face in almost every photo since he touched down in Manchester, his time at Old Trafford won't be all sunshine and rainbows. The winter frost has coincided with his arrival and he must produce results in a busy festive period, but the 39-year-old strongly believes he is the \"right man at the right time.\"\n\nAmorim needs to transform the fortunes of a side that sit 13th in the Premier League, so he is bound to encounter challenges along the way, but he doesn't lack self-confidence. United believe they have hired one of the finest young coaches in European football and a club source recently admitted his outstanding communication skills will be a helpful asset.\n\nAmorim made a strong impression in his first press conference ahead of facing Ipswich Town this weekend and demonstrated his savvy communication skills. \"It’s so much harder to come to a team in the middle of a season because you have to know the players during the games,\" he said. \"You’re talking about no national team periods to work with the players, it’s just games. It depends if you are winning it’s a lot of fun having a lot of games and trying to make some changes tactically and winning games. But if you’re losing, you don’t have the time in training to work on everything you want to work.\n\n\"I think where you can improve a team is in training. This is the most important aspect. You can get the players to recover and react really fast, but if you don’t make any exercise with that, it’s really hard to do that on video or in recovery trainings. So it’s really hard in this way but we will find ways to try cope with that.\"\n\nAmorim's appointment has generated huge excitement and the feel-good factor around the club has returned. United fans are hoping the Portuguese is different from his predecessors, who have all struggled under the shadow of the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson in the last 11 years. \"No, not yet. I didn’t have that opportunity,\" said Amorim when asked if he'd had a chance to meet Ferguson.\n\n\"It’s hard to copy someone, so I have to be me. Of course I’m not the best person in here to show the history of Manchester United; it should be the club first and also me.\n\n\"I’m always paying attention to those details and trying to focus our players on the history of the club, not the recent history, so you have to be very demanding. This is a club that has to win.\n\n\"So we have to show that [history] to our players but it’s a different time. I cannot be the same guy Sir Alex Ferguson was. I need to have a different approach, but I can also be demanding.\"\n\nAmorim vowed to be his own man but has something in common with Ferguson: a trust in young players. Amorim's success at Sporting Lisbon was underpinned by talented players from the Portuguese club's academy and he is expected to use a similar formula at United.\n\n\"It’s the project of Manchester United,\" he said. \"Nowadays, you need young guys from the academy for everything, to bring that history of the club because they feel the club in a different way.\n\n\"But also because you have all these rules with financial fair play when a player from our academy is so much different [worth more in FFP] to the players we sell - that we bought and that we sell. So everything is connected, I will try to help all the players and especially the young ones.\"\n\nThe last question was about Pep Guardiola. The Manchester City boss has just signed a new two-year contract but was defeated by Amorim in the Champions League earlier in the month, with City suffering a 4-1 defeat to Sporting away from home.\n\n\"I think it's a problem for everyone here,\" said Amorim. \"But we have so much to do, we can't focus on anyone. We just have to focus on our club, improving our club and not focusing on the other clubs. It's amazing if you can beat that team, it's a good sign, but let's focus on United.\"",

      "headline": "Matheus Cunha has already given Ruben Amorim his first key transfer decision at Man United",
      "article_text": "Matheus Cunha has caught the eye for his impressive form at Wolves. When Wolverhampton Wanderers signed Matheus Cunha from Atletico Madrid, it was perhaps not anticipated how crucial he would become in their fight to avoid Premier League relegation. Despite Wolves' struggles, the 27-year-old is flourishing on the pitch and has continued to prove critics wrong, game after game - his form has been impossible to ignore. He already has 10 goal involvements in 12 league games this season and added to his tally during Wolves' 4-1 win over Fulham on Saturday. Cunha scored two of those four goals and also provided an assist to Joao Gomes in the process.\n\nWhile losing him in the January transfer window would be a major blow for the club, it might prove to be a rather difficult task come January. Manchester United themselves, are one of the clubs linked with Cunha and have been following him since his days at Atletico Madrid. At the time, he was mooted as a potential replacement for Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nPreviously addressing the interest from United, he admitted it was a 'real honour' to be linked with the Reds. \"You know it's a real honour to have your name linked to Manchester United,\" the Wolves star said. \"One of the biggest clubs in the world. But I'm happy at Wolves. If I'm lucky, I play another good season, but the window is open, you never know. I always want to show that (the affection) is reciprocated. Then we see that talk (Manchester United). But I’m very happy at Wolves. The focus now is on having better seasons and helping the club. God willing, I'll continue on this path.\"\n\nAfter Wolves beat United to Cunha's signature, he only needed a short period of time to really show his impact - becoming a mainstay for the Molineux team. Should a move come to fruition in the near future, the Brazilian could fit in as one of the two forwards alongside a striker at Old Trafford.\n\nWith that said, United would benefit from having a versatile player. In addition, the Brazilian's recent performances should have also been worthy of an international call-up, especially as Brazil continue to struggle in their World Cup qualifying games. Brazil are currently in dire need of more attack prowess - having won just five of their 12 World Cup qualifiers.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United starlet Chido Obi-Martin has reacted after scoring his fourth goal of the season for the Under-18 side since joining from Arsenal over the summer. Still only 16, the Danish youth international has hit top form immediately in Manchester. Bagging the first in a 3-0 win over Everton on Saturday, Obi-Martin once again started up front and impressed in a dominant team display. Alongside other notable names James Scanlon, Tyler Fletcher, and Amir Ibragimov, Obi-Martin showed just why United were so delighted to land him earlier this year.\n\nHaving generated serious attention following hauls of goals for the Arsenal academy - including 32 from 18 Under-18 Premier League matches last season with six hat-tricks, hitting four on two occasions, five on another, and seven in one match - he has taken no time getting used to his new surroundings. The form on the pitch has been reflected in his joy coming off it.\n\nPosting to his Instagram story after the match, Obi-Martin added a happy face emoji to United's full-time post. Obi-Martin is pictured in the act of scoring his early goal, the No.9 shirt on his back.\n\nHe will next be hoping to add to his goals this season when United visit Stoke City next weekend. Adam Lawrence's side have continued where they left off in 2023/24, winning all nine of their matches so far, scoring 43 and conceding just four. They were crowned Under-18 National champions last season after winning the Northern league stage. Obi-Martin will be aiming to repeat that success and is also in a strong position to thrive for his country. He scored his first goal for Denmark's Under-18s over the international break having first been selected for a squad in September.",

      "headline": "Chido Obi-Martin scores again in Man United U18s win but another 16-year-old shines to please Ruben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Manchester United Under-18s beat Leeds United Under-18s 3-0 on Saturday.\n\nChido Obi-Martin was again among the goals as Manchester United's Under-18s continued their stunning form and a new star emerged. The young Reds secured a 3-0 victory over Leeds United on Saturday to continue their incredible form. United had beaten the same opponents 8-0 a matter of weeks ago and when Jaydan Kamason struck with an arrowed finish just moments into the game a repeat scoreline looked a possibility.\n\nIndeed James Scanlon and Obi-Martin, with a simple close-range finish, struck before the break. Teenage sensation Obi-Martin is considered an exceptional prospect and he's been prolific in the academy since signing from Arsenal in the summer, a move that was seen as a significant coup.\n\nAll three goals were set up by Amir Ibragimov, who scored a hat-trick against Leeds in the previous meeting. The versatile forward, still only 16, is an England youth international who was born in Russia and joined United from Sheffield United having moved to the UK aged 11.\n\nHe is one of a number of exciting prospects in the Under-18 side who have been sensational this season and lead the league with nine wins from nine. Saturday's contest was in Group B of the U18 Premier League Cup but after finishing the first half strongly, it was a more even second period in testing conditions.\n\nThe home side saw out the contest to secure the win and claim top spot in their group. They take next on AZ in the UEFA Youth League next week aiming to continue their fine form.\n\nThe impressive performances of the club's Under-18 side will be music to the ears of new boss Ruben Amorim who is a keen advocate of promoting from the Academy. And while it is too soon to speak about this crop for first team chances in the coming months, the progress being made at youth level can only be a good sign for Amorim and United.",

      "headline": "Every word from Ruben Amorim press conference as Man United boss spoke to media for first time",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim faced the media as Manchester United head coach for the very first time at Carrington this afternoon to look ahead to Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on November 1, arrived in England on November 11 and started work on the training ground with his players at the beginning of this week.\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon chief, who is keen to install a new identity at Old Trafford, will be itching to make a winning start at Portman Road this weekend and begin the process of turning United's fortunes around.\n\nUnited did not present Amorim to the media at an official unveiling after his arrival in England last week, meaning his pre-match press conference this afternoon was his first meeting with the British media.\n\nHe was quizzed on a wide range of topics, including his style of football, his timeline for success, how involved he will be in United's recruitment, and messages he has exchanged with Jose Mourinho.\n\nHere is a full recap of how his first United press conference unfolded.\n\n### What Jose Mourinho told Ruben Amorim after he joined Manchester United\n\nJose Mourinho sent Ruben Amorim a message after he took over as the inaugural head coach of Manchester United.\n\n> \"He sent me a message,\" Amorim said. \"He told me it’s a lovely club, big club, with lovely people and that is correct, it is. But a lot of things have changed. We are in a different building now (at Carrington), we are building a new one. I’m a different guy. I was learning at the time and I hope to teach my players but the club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win.\"\n\n### Ruben Amorim criticises Manchester United players over three things\n\nRuben Amorim criticised Manchester United players' lack of work rate and stressed they have to \"be better running back\". In a bullish and blunt summation of the United squad, Amorim stressed United had to \"improve the physical aspect\" and expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's ball retention.\n\n> \"I think if you want to speak about the team, the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball,\" Amorim opined. \"We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody. And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things. I think it’s the small things and we are here to improve on the small things. The way we see football, play as a team, understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help a lot these players.\"\n\n### It shouldn't be impossible - Ruben Amorim confirms stance on Manchester United transfer strategy\n\n> \"We have to improve the process on recruitment. The data, the profile of players we want, but I have to have a strong position on that because I am the coach, I know how to play, so I think it’s all together but the final word should be the manager. Not just because it’s your right but your responsibility.\"\n\n### Ruben Amorim reveals how long it will take to judge him as Manchester United manager\n\nAmorim stressed he can be fairly judged within his first two years whether he is a credible enough coach to make United a force again.\n\n> \"I have two and a half years of contract and you guys talk about that! I think two years, you can understand if I’m the right manager to go in this process. I think we will need more time because if you look to the other clubs that are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time but they are winning, that is why they have time to do this project. I understand that we will need more than two and a half years, we will have to win something somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue in this path or you change. We will see how long it will be.\"\n\n> \"I don’t know about repair but, like I said, we have space to grow as a team. I think we have to improve in a lot of areas, the understanding of the game, I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing in the middle of the season. We have to improve the physical aspect of the team - it's something we want to improve. And that’s it. I don’t know how long it will take, I know when you are in Manchester United you have to win games. So I will not tell you that I need a lot of time. It’s a great league, it’s the strongest league in the world and we have to improve a lot to try to win it.\"\n\n> \"So what I can say is we have to win games to win time and then to win titles.\"\n\n### Amorim on the confidence of players\n\n> \"When you don't win games you start to get suspicious of the way of playing. You start feeling it in the players when they walk to the warmup. You can feel if they are confident or not. That is normal. I will help them and it will take time but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League.\"\n\n### Amorim on players changing positions\n\n> \"They want to play. In the future we will see but you have to train with them to see if they can cope with different positions. Everybody wants to play and are open to change some positions.\"",

      "article_text": "The Football Association (FA) has confirmed that Darren Fletcher's ban and fine have been reduced to two matches and £6,000 respectively.\n\nIt was alleged that around the tunnel area during United's 2-1 win over Brentford, the coach acted in an 'in an improper and/or confrontational manner and/or that he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official and the referee and/or assistant referees'.\n\nThe flashpoint occurred after United fell behind with Matthijs de Ligt off the pitch and receiving treatment. Fletcher was in the press box with the Old Trafford analysts before he made his way down to the tunnel before half-time.\n\nBoth then-manager Erik ten Hag and assistant coach Ruud van Nistelrooy were booked for their protests. However, in a judgement from the FA, the former United midfielder and Scotland international was initially charged £7,500 and handed a three-match extended touchline ban after admitting to the charge but argued it was only towards the fourth official.\n\nThe referee Samuel Barrott also denied that the first-team coach was abusive and an independent appeal board has reduced the touchline ban and fine. As a result, Fletcher has been hit with a £6,000 sanction and a two-match ban.\n\nIn a statement, the FA said: \"An independent Appeal Board has allowed an appeal by Darren Fletcher in relation to misconduct at Manchester United’s fixture against Brentford on Saturday 19 October in the Premier League.\n\n\"The FA alleged that around the tunnel area at half time the coach acted in an improper and/or confrontational manner and/or that he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official and the referee and/or assistant referees.\n\n\"Darren Fletcher admitted to this misconduct, but argued that it was only towards the fourth official and the referee, and also denied that he was abusive.\n\n\"An independent Regulatory Commission found these charges to be proven, and it imposed a three-match extended touchline ban and £7,500 fine following a hearing.\n\n\"The independent Appeal Board has reduced the extended touchline ban and fine to two matches and £6,000 respectively, and its written reasons will be published in due course.\"\n\nFletcher avoided the culling of United staff after Ten Hag's dismissal with new head coach Ruben Amorim bringing in his own backroom team. The 40-year-old is still behind the scenes at Old Trafford and despite Fletcher's long-standing association with the club, where he made 342 appearances, some fans expressed dissatisfaction over his retention instead of Van Nistelrooy.",

      "headline": "Scoring 100 goals a season and sharing a Roy Keane trait - Dan Gore's United journey",
      "article_text": "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.\n\nDan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.\n\nGore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.\n\n“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"\n\nGore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.\n\nHe trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.\n\nAlthough Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.\n\n\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.\n\n\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.\n\n\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.\n\n\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f***** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"\n\nGore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.\n\n\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.\n\n\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.\n\n\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"\n\nMike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.\n\n\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.\n\n\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.\n\n\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.\n\n\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"\n\nHargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.\n\n\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.\n\n\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"\n\nThe burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.\n\n\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.\n\n\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.\n\n\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"\n\nGore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.\n\n\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.\n\n\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"\n\nHargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.\n\n\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.\"\n\nGore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.\n\n\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.\n\n\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"\n\nHargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"\n\nGore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "article_text": "I left Man City because I had no future - now I would be perfect for Manchester United.\n\nOnce a Manchester City academy player, Jeremie Frimpong would have been in with a chance of thriving under Ruben Amorim at Man United had a deal been struck earlier this year.\n\nNobody is ever likely to forget the Bayer Leverkusen side that so nearly went the entirety of the 2023/24 season unbeaten. After winning their maiden Bundesliga title at a canter, winning 28 and drawing six of their 34 matches, Xabi Alonso's team had every right to feel confident about their chances of winning the Europa League as well. However, a hat-trick from Ademola Lookman sentenced them to their first defeat of the season in their penultimate game of it, securing Atalanta their first-ever European trophy.\n\nDespite that crushing blow in Dublin, Leverkusen responded three days later by beating FC Kaiserslautern 1-0 in the DFB-Pokal final, meaning they ended the season with 43 victories and two trophies to their name. Alonso had suddenly become the most coveted coach in Europe.\n\nCountless players produced the season of their careers, reflected by the fact five of them got into double figures for goals. One member of that quintet was former Manchester City academy product Jeremie Frimpong, who scored 14 goals across all competitions. Only Florian Wirtz (18) and Victor Boniface (21) scored more than him.\n\nArriving at Leverkusen from Celtic in January 2021 having played almost all of his senior football as a right-back, the prospect of getting into double figures in a single season must never have crossed the Netherlands international's mind. However, he was moulded into an attack-minded wing-back by Alonso.\n\nThe 23-year-old has been transformed into one of the best wing-backs in the world under his coaching methods, just years after he was left wondering what the future would hold for him after being informed by City that he had no future at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nSpeaking to SportBible earlier this year, Frimpong said: \"I kept playing an age group down and I think when I was under-23s at City, I remember going in for a new contract and that's when I knew my path at City was different. They were talking about how I couldn't get into the team and were comparing me to other players in the academy that were doing better than me. I thought, 'Yeah, I clearly don't have a future here,' so I’ve got to take a different step.\n\nThe answer was Celtic. He moved to the Glasgow club in September 2019, signing a four-year deal. However, he made his mark so quickly in Scotland that he moved to Germany less than two years later, joining Leverkusen, who were under the stewardship of Peter Bosz at the time.\n\nIt was under Alonso, appointed Leverkusen chief in October 2022, that Frimpong started to blossom. He ended the 2022/23 season with 20 direct goal contributions to his name, 16 of which were registered after Alonso's appointment. The 2023/24 campaign - Alonso's first full season in charge - saw Frimpong reach loftier heights. In addition to his 14 goals, he also registered 12 assists, playing a starring role in Leverkusen's league and cup double.\n\nHowever, long before that period in Frimpong's career, Manchester United had already touched base with his representatives, speaking to them ahead of the 2023 summer transfer window. United, as Frimpong's outstanding 2023/24 campaign unfolded, kept tabs on him and mulled over the prospect of moving for him in the 2024 summer window.\n\nPerforming so well in Germany at the time, United supporters purred at the prospect of him being signed by Erik ten Hag. He was in the form of his life, cementing himself as the best wing-back in the world at that juncture. He reportedly had a £33.5million release clause in his contract that would be active until mid-July. That made swooping for him ahead of this season all the more tempting.\n\nOf course, no move ever came to fruition, meaning Frimpong is still residing in Germany, continuing to play a key role for Leverkusen. In truth, signing the soon-to-be 24-year-old would have made little sense in the summer. United had made the decision to stick with Ten Hag, who played with a back-four, and Frimpong is a wing-back. He would have been wasted as a natural right-back. \n\nHowever, had new United head coach Ruben Amorim been appointed in the summer, moving for Frimpong would have made every sense. The recently appointed 39-year-old, who will take charge of the Reds for the first time this weekend, is expected to implement his trademark 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford. The system relies on wing-backs to provide width and support the attackers. Frimpong would be tailor-made for the role, such is the way Alonso has evolved his individual game in Germany. Not the strongest or most convincing defensively, he is much better when attacking, hence his tally of 26 direct goal contributions last season. When he goes forward, the right-sided centre-back slides across to cover any big gaps he leaves exposed.\n\nScoring one goal and registering six assists in 16 games so far this season, Frimpong is still proving to be a creative source for Leverkusen, once again causing problems from the right side of the pitch. Had Amorim been in situ at United in the summer, signing Frimpong should have been a primary mission. Under Ten Hag, however, signing him would not have made any sense.\n\nUnder Amorim, United are expected to play with a similar blueprint, with the wing-backs poised to be key to the system that is set to be implemented. Frimpong is rapid, meaning he is capable of getting up and down the pitch, even if his primary responsibility is to attack. \n\nHad Amorim been in situ at United in the summer, signing Frimpong should have been a primary mission. Under Ten Hag, however, signing him would not have made any sense. \n\nFrom there, many fans are envisioning a fruitful future. Ruben Amorim, it is believed, will look to improve his squad over the next few transfer windows, and Frimpong is certainly a name worth considering.",

      "headline": "Goncalo Gregorio exclusive: 'I played under Ruben Amorim at Casa Pia and Braga and couldn’t stop scoring… everybody loved him’",
      "article_text": "**Six months and six days.**\n\nThat's how long Ruben Amorim had spent at third-tier Portuguese side Casa Pia when he made an announcement that would leave a dressing room in tears.\n\n\"I looked across and the player next to me was crying,\" recalls Goncalo Gregorio, who was Casa Pia's top scorer at the time. \"Then I looked around the room and others were in tears.  \n\"Most of these guys had played in the top division under a lot of different managers... they were experienced. Ruben tried hiding it by looking over his shoulder but he was emotional. He likes to camouflage his feelings but as always, he ended up smiling.\"\n\nHaving guided the Lisbon-based club to unprecedented heights, Amorim reluctantly resigned from his post at the Estadio Pina Manique in early January 2019.\n\nIt was a decision that came shortly after the Portuguese Football Federation suspended him for a year for delivering in-game instructions without having the appropriate UEFA badges. Officially, he was only registered as a coaching intern.\n\nAfter the club were threatened with a points deduction and a significant fine, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturned Amorim's suspension but, to the surprise of many, the man in charge decided to leave.\n\n\"The captain and those with more power were trying to get him to stay,\" Gregorio tells _SPORTbible_. \"I remember my teammates saying, 'You should stay with us and battle. We are on this ship together.' Three or four guys tried to get him to reconsider, including myself.  \n\"I was playing so well at the time. Last year, for example, I was playing for Dinamo Bucharest, one of the biggest clubs in Romania. We had a really good connection with the coach. He left and nobody was crying. With Ruben, it was different. He is not just a manager. He is like a father. A friend.\"\n\nThose who would run through brick walls for their manager tried putting a stop to the escalating situation but deep down, Amorim knew it was the right time to leave. He thought it was unfair that people were trying to damage his reputation.\n\n\"Honestly, we were playing great and the atmosphere was so good but we couldn't change his final decision,\" Gregorio says. \"He was upset with numerous things. We had to respect it.\"\n\nMore than four years on from Amorim's resignation and the amount of respect Gregorio has for the now-Manchester United manager is palpable; even if they haven't been in touch for a while. It's easy to understand why when you peel away the layers of their relationship.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Goncalo Gregorio was stuck in a rut.\n\nWith just five goals to his name across the 2017/18 campaign – a run of form that brought criticism from fans – his confidence was at an all-time low when the charismatic figure of Ruben Amorim walked through the weathered doors of Casa Pia's training ground.\n\nAfter accepting a contract that was less than half the minimum wage, Amorim got to work on improving every aspect of the club. One of his first demands was to reschedule training from 7pm to an early morning slot.  \n\nHe also insisted that the grass be cut and watered regularly to encourage a fast-paced style of play. Amorim wanted a professional set-up.\n\n\"He was really demanding,\" Gregorio says. \"Ruben wanted the best conditions for us to prepare; whether that was organising ice baths or doing more gym work to prevent injuries. He introduced physical tests that we didn't have beforehand. He did so much.  \n\"Directors and other people in higher positions didn't want to change these things as other processes had been put in place for a long time but he went against them. He thought it was important.\"\n\nGregorio smiles as he reminisces about those times. \"We wanted to give absolutely everything for him. He felt so passionate about the job and football itself. You just want to pay him back.\"\n\nDespite his intentions, however, Amorim's reign got off to a disastrous start. In fact, after Casa Pia suffered defeats in their opening two games of the season, Amorim told sporting director Carlos Pires that he would quit if they lost the following week.\n\n“We managed to calm him down, convince him to keep working and it would bring results,” Pires told The Athletic. “There was no chance he could leave.”\n\nThankfully for all involved, Casa Pia recorded a 4-0 win over Pinhalnovense as a certain Goncalo Gregorio scored a hat-trick. Amorim experimented with a 3-4-3 formation that has become all too familiar at Braga and Sporting in recent years, and an eight-game unbeaten run followed thanks, in part, to Gregorio, who couldn't stop scoring.\n\n\"I just felt really confident playing under him,\" the 29-year-old says.  \n\"His passion to work every day with a smile is infectious. Football can be an exhausting profession, and sometimes a player doesn't want to train or move. He won't have any of that. We all wanted to get up and give everything for him. He created a family.\"\n\nWhen asked which of his teammates improved most under Amorim, the Lisbon-born striker grins.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, all of the team, but the main example was me. I went from scoring five goals in the previous season to scoring 25 goals in a few months. I flourished in his 3-4-3 system. The striker has to focus on playing between the lines, but I was supported by both the wingers and full-backs. We had solutions all of the time, in any situation.  \n\"One of the best things about Ruben is the way he gets the best out of every single player,\" says Gregorio, who now plays for Armenian Premier League side FC Noah. \"Whether you're in the academy or a regular in the first-team, he'll treat you the same.\"\n\nAmorim is widely renowned as a great tactician. His teams will sit deep when required and push high at the right moment but time and time again, it's his character that shines through.\n\nBruno Simao, a childhood friend of Amorim, recently told the story of a player at Casa Pia who couldn't afford to pay rent or look after his children and as a result, the authorities threatened to take his kids away from him.\n\nAmorim stepped in and promised to find a solution.\n\n\"I remember he paid an entire year of his rent for the house,\" says Gregorio. \"The player had some difficulties. He was working at McDonald's and playing at the same time, so he didn't have a great deal of money. It meant so much to him. He'd often say that Ruben was like a father to him.  \n\"And here's the thing. This guy almost never played in our team but Ruben said he was important, like the rest of us. He wasn't even in the 18-man squad. Ruben had money to do it but there are a lot of people who have money and wouldn't do such a thing… It sums him up as a man.\"\n\nA handful of players felt that kind of support from Amorim, even after he left Casa Pia.\n\nAndre Paulo, his first-choice goalkeeper, suffered a season-ending knee injury, just two weeks after Amorim's departure.\n\nGregorio recalls him being out for several months as Casa Pia secured promotion to the second tier. In fact, the club decided to let him leave after a lack of minutes, so Paulo returned to the third division with Real Sport Clube.  \n\nA year later, when Amorim took over at Sporting, his first signing was the goalkeeper who was so integral at the start of his coaching career. Paulo, who said he was \"eternally grateful\" to Amorim for the opportunity, made his first-team debut for one of Portugal's biggest clubs in 2021.\n\nGregorio goes on to share his favourite memory from working under Amorim at Casa Pia, and it might just give you an idea as to why he was suspended by the Portuguese Football Federation. Still, you can’t fault his passion.\n\n\"He wasn't allowed to stand up from the bench because he was an intern but on one occasion, the referee wasn't blowing up after I was the target of some hard tackles,\" he begins.\n\n\"We lost and he went crazy. He wanted to speak to the official and it took four or five of us to drag him away. He just wanted to defend me. It's a memory that still touches me. He cares about his players. His will to win was massive, and we needed that in the third division. We needed that to earn our salary; to live. He felt that.\"\n\nNine months after leaving Casa Pia, Amorim was appointed head coach of Braga reserves, where he would pick up seven wins from a possible eight. Amorim spent just three months with the B team before being promoted to the senior side in December 2019 but that period was special for Goncalo Gregorio.\n\nBy sheer coincidence, he was on loan at Braga B when the Portuguese coach walked through the doors. After such an impressive campaign under Amorim at Casa Pia, Gregoria was snapped up by soon-to-be Primeira Liga side Ferreira Palace.\n\n\"I needed to go out on loan to prove myself; to show I wasn't just a one-season wonder,\" he recalls. \"Braga B called me and said they were interested. After five games of the season, the coach was fired and Amorim took over.\n\n\"I said to all of my teammates, 'Hey, this guy will come and you're going to love him'. They asked why, which was understandable as I'd only been with him for four months. I said, 'Believe me, you will love him too much.' It was true. Everybody loved him.\"\n\n\"Three or four months later, he got promoted to Braga's first-team. He told me that the president was going to buy me and I'd soon be a first-team player. But then Sporting bought him for €10 million, so our paths went in different directions.”\n\nAmorim went on to become one of Europe's most exciting and highly-rated coaches across a four-year spell at Sporting, where he would lift five trophies, including two league titles. Gregorio would soon play for Zaglebie Sosnowiec in Poland and Dinamo Bucharest; one of Romania's biggest clubs.\n\nBut he struggled to replicate the form that made him one of Portugal’s most clinical strikers. That short but prolific spell under Amorim took his game to another level.\n\n\"I mentioned it before but I just felt so confident playing under him,\" the striker says. \"He brings an incredible aura to the team.\"\n\nSo what can Manchester United players expect from Amorim in the coming weeks and months?\n\n\"Everything will be different under Ruben,\" says Gregorio. \"Right now, United are fragile. They aren't in a good way but he has the power and authority to change everything. He will put every process in place. Gym, training, tactics. You name it. He will change everything.\"\n\nIn his first training session at Carrington, the energy and intensity was clear, and so were the patterns of play imported straight from the Casa Pia training ground all those years ago.\n\nUnited lined up in his favoured 3-4-2-1 setup, featuring a compact back three, overlapping wingbacks and inside forwards. Somebody who Gregorio believes will flourish under Amorim is Marcus Rashford.\n\nHe said: \"Rashford has the potential to be his striker. He can make diagonals because he's very fast and has a good shot. I can imagine Bruno Fernandes playing at number 10, like Pedro Gonçalves at Sporting. Amad could take Francisco Trincão's position.\n\n\"But if he doesn't have the right players, then Ruben will scout the market. [Viktor] Gyokeres will be a target, for sure. He's scoring a lot of goals right now.\"\n\nOn the subject of Rashford, who has struggled for consistency in recent times, Gregorio is convinced Amorim can help turn things around, just like he did with him at Casa Pia.\n\n\"This is one of the best things about Ruben,\" says Gregorio. \"He'll clear everything in their minds. It's a new life for them. Even Antony, I see criticism but what about giving him a chance to play behind the striker? If he works hard, that is... If he doesn't, he'll kick him out for sure.\"\n\nHe has only taken a handful of training sessions ahead of Sunday's anticipated clash against Ipswich Town but Amorim has \"guaranteed\" to give United fans an idea of what's to come.\n\n\"I will definitely be watching that game,\" Gregorio says. \"It'll be midnight here in Armenia but I'll try and stay up. He will win, for sure. This process will require some time but you'll see a difference in terms of the character of the team.\"\n\nAs we wrap up our lengthy chat, Gregorio has one last thing to say about his former manager's next challenge. \"Ruben will not be known as the Special One, but the Smiley One,\" he grins. \"I think he'll be remembered for his smile.\"",

      "headline": "Schooled like Mourinho: Amorim’s path from pioneering Lisbon university",
      "article_text": "Portugal’s coaches and players are all the rage in part thanks to links forged between academia and the game\n\nThey always knew Ruben Amorim was a special one at the faculty of human kinetics. “I interviewed him for the course and from the start it was obvious,” says Prof António Veloso, José Mourinho’s former classmate, who runs the high-performance football coaching course at the faculty, which is affiliated to the University of Lisbon.\n\n“The students needed to do an essay on specialist topics and Ruben’s results were fantastic. He had a leadership role in the group. When we were doing tactical drills on the pitch all the other students were looking at Ruben’s and asking for his opinion. But he was very humble.”\n\nPerhaps then he is not an exact replica of the original Special One, who also studied at the faculty and remains a close friend of Veloso. The professor recalls Mourinho as a 26-year-old, when he had dropped out of business school and conceded that becoming a professional footballer was outside of his skill set. He had signed up for the sports science course and took an especially enthusiastic interest in the university football league and the team of professors of which he was player-coach. “The same killer instinct he showed afterwards was already there,” Veloso says. “I remember him telling his teammates: ‘Don’t be soft! Be tough!’”\n\nPortuguese coaches are all the rage, as Amorim’s appointment confirms. Where once the UK sent managers such as Sir Bobby Robson, Graeme Souness and John Mortimore to Portugal, a line stretching back to Arthur John in the 1920s, now there are as many Portuguese as English coaches in the Premier League. They are also the fourth-best represented nation in terms of Premier League players, after England, Brazil and France. Portugal has a population of 10.5 million and it is hard to think of a nation punching more above its weight in European football.\n\nPart of the answer as to why is perhaps found in Cruz Quebrada, the sleepy Lisbon suburb overlooking the spectacular Tagus estuary, where the faculty that helped form the current and former United managers is located. Everyone knows Mourinho got his big break as Robson’s translator at Sporting but fewer recall that Mourinho’s initial pathway into football was academic.\n\nVeloso stayed in academia after his sports science course but also remained in touch with his classmate, so when he wanted to set up a master’s degree course in football coaching, he took Mourinho’s brain and downloaded it into an academic course.\n\n“It was exactly like that,” Veloso says. “José was always mentioning that he studied here and naming our faculty as his alma mater. If we were designing a finance course, we would definitely use someone in that sector of his level to help us. So I called him and said: ‘I think we have a unique opportunity to develop a programme based on your knowledge of football, linked with your academic background. You’re in a unique position, having a scientific view of your profession.’”\n\nThe course they developed covers everything Mourinho considered important, though not any of his dark arts. They teach psychology that goes well beyond the superficial motivational pep talk, a deeper level of physiology and how to manage upwards to a Russian oligarch or private equity fund manager.\n\nThe EFL chair, Rick Parry, runs the module on governance, including role-playing how to respond when your player has made a racist remark, and a body language expert instructs on non-verbal communication so as to transmit positive messages to players from the bench (Thomas Tuchel, take note).\n\nAmorim was accepted as one of the early intakes, in 2017, even though, as a footballer at Belenenses and Benfica, he had never been to university. Special provision is made for smart candidates who, for obvious reasons, have never completed a first degree. Whether the course will provide him with an edge in Manchester is unclear, given Carlos Vicens, Pep Guardiola’s No 2, was a star pupil the year after Amorim attended. Pedro Marques, Liverpool’s director of football development, and two of Amorim’s assistants have studied on separate courses at the faculty.\n\nIt is telling that academia and football are comfortable bedfellows in a way they have never been in England. Mutual suspicion in the Great British class war has meant those in ivory towers don’t mix with workers at the grassroots on the pitch. But Portugal is different and another Manchester United man, Carlos Queiroz, is largely responsible.\n\nIt was Prof Mirandela da Costa, who headed up the football department at the faculty and was director general of the Portuguese board of sport, who asked his best student, Queiroz, to revamp their football in the 80s. Queiroz, whose paper on youth development and coaching became a sacred text, subsequently coached what became known as the Golden Generation, starring Luís Figo, Rui Costa and Gil Gomes, to Under-20 World Cup titles in 1989 and 1991.\n\nFrom that acorn grew the mighty oaks of the country’s football, which arguably could be personified in Mourinho, Cristiano Ronaldo and their mutual agent, Jorge Mendes, whose innate understanding of the 21st century football market did so much to conquer European leagues. “José opened the door for Portuguese coaches,” Veloso says. “But it was more like a gate than a door. And Ronaldo opened a door for players.” A Portuguese player tends to come kite-marked with quality assurance.\n\n“The starting point of the revolution was the link between academia and the Portuguese federation,” Veloso says. “And then we got lucky to get some people who were extremely good. But it would be difficult to imagine someone at a British university asking your top Manchester United coach to organise a coach education programme such as ours.”\n\nWhen Sir Alex Ferguson retired, it was Harvard Business School that tapped into his expertise by signing him up for lectures. Oxford and Cambridge universities, both of whom had representation on the FA council until last year, probably never considered that an option. Veloso, who knows plenty of open-minded people in British academia, as well as talented graduates at Premier League clubs, says: “You need to have both worlds together, with experienced people working at a high level.”\n\nIf Amorim can succeed at Old Trafford, perhaps he can be part of bridging that gap.",

      "headline": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester",
      "article_text": "Eleven days after Manchester United routed Leicester under Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Carabao Cup here, the interim manager signed off with another easy-street win over the Foxes and so ends his four-game term unbeaten.\n\nIn all the Dutchman has three victories, and for this one he could thank Bruno Fernandes, who graced a 250th United appearance by scoring the first goal and causing enough trouble for the hapless Victor Kristiansen to bundle past his goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for the second.\n\nFernandes’s goal was a fourth of Van Nistelrooy’s brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain’s previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag has been replaced by Rúben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is due to be on Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one.\n\nFernandes said: “It was a long time that I wasn’t scoring and now goals are coming in the last few games.”\n\nIn an unsurprising move, Van Nistelrooy’s one change from the XI that drew with Chelsea last Sunday was finding a place for the explosive aggression of Amad Diallo – Alejandro Garnacho was the fall guy – and his thrust had the visitors on their heels throughout.\n\nOne dart swept the 22-year-old deep into Leicester territory and provoked Abdul Fatawu into upending him. Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared.\n\nUnited hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped.\n\nThe first of Diallo’s double in Thursday’s Europa League victory over Paok was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out.\n\nThe Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes’s opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper’s team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner.\n\nUnited were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him – understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat André Onana at close range.\n\nCue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi. Yet overall United were akin to a boxer ahead on points keeping the opposing pugilist at arm’s length with their jab: of this, Harry Winks’ hit-and-hope effort was emblematic.\n\nBut the gaps in midfield remained in quick transition and so Winks’ lob into Buonanotte left United scrambling and Mazraoui appearing to take him down. This occurred on the borderline of the area but Peter Bankes gave neither penalty or free-kick, the referee invoking the travelling faithful’s ire.\n\nA far more sour pill was theirs to swallow next, in what was a calamity of errors from those in blue. Mazraoui’s flighted delivery was missed comically by both Jannik Vestergaard and Wout Faes, and Kristiansen’s nightmare continued as the ball glanced off the marauding Fernandes’ thigh and pinged in off the defender for an own goal and 2-0. The half ended with Diallo – who else? – burning a hole through Leicester and shooting, though the sharp Hermansen beat his effort away.\n\nCould United close this out? Being unable to seal the deal has been one of their major faults. Manuel Ugarte was a fire-dousing dynamo who did his best to ensure they did so. A chop of Buonanotte that gave a free-kick near United’s D was due to this enthusiasm but the hash Leicester made of the dead ball let him off the hook.\n\nOn 57 minutes Van Nistelrooy removed a disappointing Rashford for Garnacho and Diogo Dalot for Jonny Evans (perhaps for a knock), Lisandro Martínez moving to left-back and Mazraoui to right-back.\n\nAfter a clip on the ankle that needed treatment, Martínez fed Garnacho but he muddled down a cul-de-sac near the left corner flag and James Justin mopped up. The winger did the precise same thing after a glorious left-footed 40-yard Ugarte parabola took him clear. As Garnacho reached the area, a cutback on Faes failed, and he fell over.\n\nBut the 20-year-old laughed last and loudest thanks to a seventh goal of the campaign created by Fernandes’s curving pass and finished by an arrow from the winger that allowed Hermansen scant chance.\n\nHis celebration was muted. Fernandes said: “Garnacho scored a banger but didn’t celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him: ‘People will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.’”",

      "headline": "Ruud van Nistelrooy admits future desire to manage Manchester United",
      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has said he would like to take charge of Manchester United on a permanent basis in the future but is committed to stay as an assistant to incoming head coach, Rúben Amorim, after a four-game spell in caretaker charge.\n\nVan Nistelrooy heads into his final match as interim head coach unbeaten after two wins and a draw and will be optimistic of adding three more points to his tally when Leicester visit Old Trafford on Sunday having already beaten them there 5-2 in the Carabao Cup.\n\n“Of course,” Van Nistelrooy said when asked if he would want to return to the United hot seat one day. “I thought this through well when I made the decision to come to Manchester United as an assistant manager or assistant coach. I thought that through and I knew that coming to Manchester United was for me a special occasion where I felt I wanted to be part of this journey with the club in also an assistant role. I had clear ambitions to manage, I made the decision to sign a two-year deal as an assistant and I’m still in that frame of mind to be fair, to stay in that capacity.”\n\nAmorim starts work on Monday and will hold talks with Van Nistelrooy about the Dutchman’s role at United. The Portuguese will have almost a fortnight to plan for his first match in charge away against Ipswich, although most of his players will be on international duty for the majority of that period.\n\nOne key area for Amorim to address is a lack of goals. Thirteenth-placed United have scored nine times in 10 Premier League games and will need to improve that record if they are to move up the table. “When you want to be a successful side in the Premier League and in Europe, you’re going to need a certain amount of goals,” Van Nistelrooy said. “That’s why the best teams in the world have those players. At the moment we have players who get a certain amount of goals or assists but obviously they are in an age when they have to be developed, and there’s potential that they will be, and the belief is they can. In this moment that’s where we are.”\n\nUnited were handed a boost on Friday with the return of Luke Shaw to training. The left-back has not played for the club since February, however he will not be available for Sunday’s game.\n\nThe United coach Darren Fletcher has been banned from the touchline for three games for his behaviour at half-time against Brentford in October. A Football Association independent regulatory commission found that he had “acted in an improper and/or confrontational manner and/or that he used abusive and/or insulting words towards the fourth official and the referee and/or assistant referees around the tunnel area”. The club hopes to reduce the ban on appeal.",

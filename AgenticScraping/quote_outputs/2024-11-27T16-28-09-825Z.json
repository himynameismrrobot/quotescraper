Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n        \n    *   On fellow defender Lenny Yoro's availability: \"He is available to train but we are working on his fitness, which is important. He is a young guy. We believe in him a lot and we are trying to prepare the best way.\"\n        \n    *   On his first match at Old Trafford: \"Everybody has said it will be a special time. Before the match it will be like a new sensation, but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that match.\"\n        \n    *   Amorim confirmed that there will be squad rotation for Thursday's match: \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games. We are in the beginning of something. They have to feel that they are part of the team.\"\n    \n    *   On Thursday's opponents: \"I'm expecting a very good team, they can win the [Norwegian] league this week. They run a lot and that is a very good thing for us because we need to improve that. They have some special players on the wings and they can play in the pockets very well.\"\n    \n    *   On the lack of goalscorers in recent years: \"Of course there is a concern, but we have to improve as a team. But we have quality players who can score lots of goals. Rasmus [Hojlund] Joshua [Zirkzee] and Rashford will score more goals.\"\n    \n    *   On helping Rashford find his best form: \"I will try to help him. It wasn't the best position for him [against Ipswich], we will try to find the right solution for him. He has to be the first one to really want it.\"\n\n3.  **Henry Brownsey**  \n    BBC Sport journalist\n    \n    Manchester United fans hope Ruben Amorim will be 'The Man' but he was hoping for more points than just 'One'.",

        "article_headline": "Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his Manchester United plan",
        "article_text": "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim will have learnt a lot from his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nToday (Tuesday) marks exactly a year to the day since Kobbie Mainoo made his first Premier League start, starring in a 3-0 win for Manchester United over Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nThe midfielder had missed the start of the season after suffering an ankle injury in pre-season, and after three appearances on the bench, former United manager Erik ten Hag made the decision to unleash him from the start against the Toffees.\n\nThat particular trip to Merseyside will always be remembered most for Alejandro Garnacho's stunning acrobatic effort just three minutes in. However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\n\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th Premier League start and not his first.\n\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of United's 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\n\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make Ruben Amorim's first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\n\nOf that midfield trio, Mainoo was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\n\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\n\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and Amad in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\n\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\n\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\n\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on Monday Night Football, where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\n\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\n\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\n\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\n\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\n\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\n\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\n\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.",

        "article_text": "**Lionel Messi has previously admitted that Barcelona players \"hated\" a Premier League club more than bitter rivals Real Madrid – and it was something he \"never thought\" he would say.**\n\nThe Argentine was only a teenager when he decided to go public with the comments during an interview with the News of the World in 2005.\n\nAt the time, there was bad blood between [Barcelona](https://www.sportbible.com/barcelona) and [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) after the Blues produced a memorable comeback at Stamford Bridge in what was a dramatic Champions League last-16 clash.\n\nA week earlier, [Jose Mourinho](https://www.sportbible.com/jose-mourinho) made some not-so-subtle comments about referee Anders Frisk after Didier Drogba was controversially sent off in the first leg.\n\nThe two-legged clash left a bitter taste in the mouth of Barcelona players. In fact, ahead of their last-16 clash in 2006, an 18-year-old [Messi](https://www.sportbible.com/lionel-messi) was vocal about Chelsea.\n\n\"There are \\[Barcelona\\] players here who hate Chelsea more than [Real Madrid](https://www.sportbible.com/real-madrid),\" he said.\n\n\"I never thought I would hear myself say that. I also never thought I would see something worse than the Boca and River Plate rivalry or Brazil vs Argentina - but this is.\n\n\"We would rather play Arsenal, [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"\n\nMessi would go on to produce a superb display for the Catalan side, despite being hacked down by Chelsea defender Asier Del Horno, who was sent off for a shocking challenge on the Argentine.\n\nAn own goal from John Terry and a late strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a first leg advantage before they knocked Jose Mourinho's side out following a 1-1 draw at the Camp Nou.\n\nBarca would lift the [Champions League](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league) that year after Juliano Belletti scored a late winner at the Stade de France against Arsenal.\n\nMessi later recalled a 2012 Champions League defeat to Chelsea as being one of his biggest regrets in a Barcelona shirt.\n\n“I would have liked to have tried to win another Champions League,\" he said in 2021, when he announced his decision to leave Barca.\n\n“We got knocked out in the semi-final's by Liverpool which stopped us getting to another final. We got to the semi-final with Chelsea with Pep \\[Guardiola\\], they prevented us from getting to another final.\n\n“And I think there could have been another time where we could have won another Champions League.”",

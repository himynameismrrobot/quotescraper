      "headline": "'Dreamer' Amorim 'right guy' to revive Man Utd, published at 14:21",
      "article_text": "New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he is the \"right man\" for the club but will need time to implement his ideas.\n\nThe 39-year-old signed a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month to replace Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October.\n\nUnited are 13th in the Premier League table, seven points above Sunday's opponents Ipswich Town, who are fourth from bottom.\n\nWhile Amorim recognises the size of the task facing him at Old Trafford, he believes he can turn the club's fortunes around.\n\n\"I'm a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself and I believe in the club,\" he said during his first news conference as head coach.\n\n\"I truly believe in the players, I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things. You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\n\n\"Call me naive, but I believe I am the right guy at the right time. I truly believe I am the right guy.\"\n\nThe Portuguese, who has joined United after four years at Sporting, insisted he will bring change in order for the club to challenge for the Premier League title again.\n\nHe added: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take.\"\n\nGiven his nationality and success in Portugal, Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho, who had spells in the Premier League with United, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nAmorim, though, was keen to play down the comparisons.\n\n\"I'm different from Mourinho, I remember that time,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n\n\"I think I'm right for now.\"\n\nYes, he will ultimately be judged by results on the pitch, but this was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nHowever, he also firmly rejected the suggestion this was 'the impossible job'. \"Of course not,\" he said.\n\nAmorim is the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford – so a lot is resting on him. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty - a senior director at the petrochemicals company - and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance.\n\nBased on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.",

      "headline": "Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules, published at 09:33",
      "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City.\n\nToday's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nAfter all, the changes the league was proposing - after a tribunal panel found elements of the APTs were unlawful - will weaken the rules. Clearly 16 clubs were loathe to loosen them even more.\n\nThe Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future.\n\nHowever, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiralling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote.\n\nLast week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules.\n\nThey feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nClarification from the tribunal is still to be received but City feel its recommendations will end up siding with them, which will effectively make today's vote irrelevant.\n\nBackground\n\nIn October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nManchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\n\nAfter the tribunal, City claimed the rules were void and they criticised the Premier League's misleading suggestion they could be swiftly amended.\n\nThe club threatened further legal action if there was a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nBut following meetings of its Legal Advisory Group and Financial Controls Advisory Group, the Premier League proposed several amendments before today's vote in London.\n\nCity argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League.",

      "headline": "Go big or go home on Arsenal's defence - FPL tips & team of week, published at 12:59",
      "article_text": "**We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.**\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\n_The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit._\n\nHow did last week's team do?\n----------------------------\n\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n----------------------\n\n**David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m**\n\n**Gabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m**\n\n**William Saliba, Arsenal, £6m**\n\n**All home to Nottingham Forest**\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\n**Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n--------\n\n**Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton**\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\n**Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich**\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\n**Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford**\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\n**Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves**\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n--------\n\n**Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\n**Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\n**Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth**\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n-----------\n\n**Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves**\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\n**Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton**\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\n**Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\n**Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton**\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\n**Total team cost = £98.5m**\n\nTeam to target\n--------------\n\n**Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)**\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

      "headline": "'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
      "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One'\n\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\n\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\n\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\n\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\n\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\n\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\n\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United? Morais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.",

      "article_text": "New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.\n\nSpeaking at his first news conference as United boss, Amorim said: \"I’m a little bit of a dreamer. I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n\n\"You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\"\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.\n\nAsked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing.\n\n\"I don’t know about repair.\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try and win the title.\n\n\"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\n\nAmorim takes charge of United for the first time on Sunday, at Ipswich Town (16:30 GMT).\n\nIn his first media briefing, he outlined the challenges ahead, stating: \"It’s bigger - you feel here’s a global club. There’s so much to do not just coaching the team. I’ve had a lot of help. I feel at home.\"\n\nOn where he sees scope for improvement at United, he underscored: \"We have to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing the way we play. We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. We have to improve a lot to try and win the title.\"\n\nWith the focus on recruitment, Amorim expressed a desire for a collaborative process, emphasizing the importance of the manager's role in player selection.\n\nAs his tenure begins, Amorim's optimistic outlook could bring renewed energy and hope to the Manchester United squad, reflecting the highs and lows experienced in the past seasons as they aim for resurgence in the Premier League.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim criticised Manchester United players' lack of work rate and stressed they have to \"be better running back\".\n\nAmorim was filmed during his first team training session at Carrington on Monday timing United's attacks and urging the players to run back faster.\n\nA number of United players have been accused of refusing to muck in in recent years. Former club captain Gary Neville questioned wingers Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho's willingness to track back earlier this month.\n\nIn a bullish and blunt summation of the United squad, Amorim stressed United had to \"improve the physical aspect\" and expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's ball retention.\n\n\"I think if you want to speak about the team, the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball,\" Amorim opined. \"We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody.\n\n\"And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things. I think it’s the small things and we are here to improve on the small things. The way we see football, play as a team, understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help a lot these players.\"\n\nAmorim also confirmed there is a willingness among the players to adapt to his favoured 3-4-3 formation. \"I think they want to play, in this first moment, they just want to play, so it’s easy.\n\n\"In the future, we will see. I have to understand. You can watch on TV, but you have to train with them to understand if they can cope with different positions. So we are in that phase.\n\n\"Everybody wants to play now, if they have an opportunity to play as a goalkeeper they will play in the moment! In the future, they will see. But they are open to change some positions.\n\n\"That’s for sure (that the players have lost belief) but this is normal in every team. When you don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. I cannot control the ball with pressure, so these small things, you start feeling in the players.\n\n\"You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up, you can feel if they are confident or not. So that is a normal thing. I think I have to help them to feel that. It will take time, but they are ready to cope with the demands of the Premier League because they have proved that.\n\n\"You can see even this year and last year sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half without any tactical change, they will turn up and change things. They have to find the mindset to play this way through all the game.\"\n\nAmorim admitted some players would have to be reinvented to adjust to his system but suggested there would not be radical changes to the starting XI in his first match in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\n\"As a coach, you have to choose one way or another. I choose always 100 per cent our way. I prefer to risk a little bit but to push in the first moment. Since the first day, I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe, too.\n\n\"So there is no second doubts, no second way. It’s one way and we are going to do it. We will adapt some players because we don't have the right profile. This team was built for a different system.\n\n\"But it's the same thing playing with five or four, the principles are the same. The positioning is a little bit different. But maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change. But you will feel it in the game during the positioning in the way they receive the ball, covering the ball, you will see some changes.",

Multi-hazard storm system Storm Bert will hit the United Kingdom this weekend as football matches in Manchester and beyond face the threat of strong winds, heavy rain as well as snow and blizzards. \n\nManchester City host Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League at 5:30pm on Saturday, while games across the North West are set to take place amid an amber warning for snow and ice from the Met Office with numerous yellow warnings issued for rain and wind. \n\nIt is rare for Premier League matches to be postponed due to the advanced technology and state-of-the-art frost covers to prevent pitches from freezing when the temperatures drop and waterlogged pitches. \n\nThere is a full compliment of fixtures scheduled in each tier of England's football pyramid with the top-flight, second division and some League One fixtures returning following the international break. \n\nYellow warnings in place from 5am to 7pm on Saturday have been issued with winds of up to 60 miles per hour expected across Scotland and parts of northern England. While, southern England is expected to feel the gale forces later on Saturday with gusts of up to 70mph around the south coast until 9pm on Sunday. \n\nThe environment agency has warned heavy rain could lead to localised flooding with a yellow warning in place across the south-west and central England and Wales for rainfall up to 70mm. In parts of Dartmoor and south Wales, it has been suggested that the average rainfall for the whole of November could fall in just a day. \n\nKeep up to date with the Manchester Evening News live-blog for updates on the latest news and updates regarding football across the country. \n\nNational League match between Halifax Town and Sutton United has been postponed due to a frozen pitch.  \n\nAn amber cold alert is also in place for much of England until 6pm on Saturday, meaning there is an increased health risk to vulnerable people. \n\nMet Office spokesman Oli Claydon said Storm Bert: \"Because of the different nature of the weather across the UK, people really need to have an idea of what the forecast is for them specifically.

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has held his inaugural press conference as Man United head coach.\n\nRuben Amorim faced the media as Manchester United head coach for the very first time at Carrington this afternoon to look ahead to Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on November 1, arrived in England on November 11 and started work on the training ground with his players at the beginning of this week.\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon chief, who is keen to install a new identity at Old Trafford, will be itching to make a winning start at Portman Road this weekend and begin the process of turning United's fortunes around.\n\nUnited did not present Amorim to the media at an official unveiling after his arrival in England last week, meaning his pre-match press conference this afternoon was his first meeting with the British media.\n\nHe was quizzed on a wide range of topics, including his style of football, his timeline for success, how involved he will be in United's recruitment and messages he has exchanged with Jose Mourinho.\n\nJose Mourinho sent Ruben Amorim a message after he took over as the inaugural head coach of Manchester United.\n\n\"He sent me a message,\" Amorim said. \"He told me it’s a lovely club, big club, with lovely people and that is correct, it is.\nBut a lot of things have changed. We are in a diff building now (at Carrington), we are building a new one. I’m a different guy. I was learning at the time and I hope to teach my players but the club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win.\"\n\nRuben Amorim criticised Manchester United players' lack of work rate and stressed they have to \"be better running back\".\n\nIn a bullish and blunt summation of the United squad, Amorim stated that United had to \"improve the physical aspect\" and expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's ball retention.\n\n\"I think if you want to speak about the team, the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball,\" Amorim opined.\n\n\"We have to be better running back.

I can tell you in the small things I can help a lot these players.\"\n\nAmorim stressed he can be fairly judged within his first two years whether he is a credible enough coach to make United a force again.\n\n\"I have two and a half years of contract and you guys talk about that!\nI think two years, you can understand if I’m the right manager to go in this process. I think we will need more time because if you look to the other clubs that are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time but they are winning, that is why they have time to do this project.\nI understand that we will need more than two and a half years, we will have to win something somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue in this path or you change. We will see how long it will be.\n\nWe have space to grow as a team and we need to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing in the middle of the season with a different way of playing. We need to improve the physical aspect of the team. I don't know how long it will take but I know we need to win games at Manchester United. I will not tell you we need a lot of time but we need to improve a lot to win titles.\"\n\nAmorim feels aligned with the views of Manchester United and believes in the club's potential.\n\n\"I am a dreamer and I believe in myself. I believe in the club and we have the same idea and same mindset. I think we have room to improve and I want to try new things.\"\n\nHe confirmed, \"We will play our way. As a coach you have to choose one way or another. I choose always 100% our way. If they feel like since the first day that I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. It is one way and we are going to do it. We may need to adapt some players who were bought to play a different system but on Sunday you will see the starting XI and you will feel a lot of change in the positioning and the way they receive the ball.\"\n\nAmorim also commented on maintaining player confidence, stating, \"When you don't win games you start to get suspicious of the way of playing. You start feeling it in the players when they walk to the warm-up. You can feel if they are confident or not. That is normal.\"\n\nIn summary, Amorim is set to instill change at Manchester United, focusing on physicality, player development, and a distinct playing style as he prepares for his Premier League debut this weekend. \n\nKey events from the press conference included his focus on player recruitment, performance improvement, and confidence building among players as they adapt to his management style.",

Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony.\n\nQuickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to. They're not ready.\"\n\nRodri has been out of action since sustaining a knee ligament injury in a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on September 22.\n\nNow, the Spanish midfielder has finally spoke out about the Ballon d’Or debacle.\n\n“I think he’s a smart guy and with time you’ll realize that the more you pay attention on the field, the better he [Vini Jr] will be,\" Rodri told Spanish TV programme [El Largeuro](https://x.com/ellarguero).\n\n“Athletes are not just what you represent on the field, but also off it.”\n\nBut it was Vini Jr's Brazil teammate Neymar who could not help but give his thoughts on Rodri's words with a five-word dig in the comment section of [Futeousadia](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCp5PtCoSBm/?igsh=MXc5dzJ1aDJpOHVmOQ%3D%3D)'s Instagram post.\n\nThe Al Hilal man commented: \"Virou falador agora (he becomes a talker now - in English).\"\n\nNeymar previously referred to the Real Madrid man as a \"great idol\" and \"hero\" for the people of Brazil even explaining how he didn't \"think there's anyone but him [Vini Jr] to win it [Ballon d'Or]\" when speaking to SNTV [Via [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/neymar-brazil-vinicius-jr-award_sto20046022/story.shtml)] in October.\n\nThe former Barcelona man has also never won the Ballon d’Or despite arguably being one of the best players over the last 15 years.\n\nIn Neymar’s case, he was up against the seemingly unstoppable Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with this year’s nominee list being the only one to not feature one of the pairing since 2003.",

      "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?\" by the club’s social media channels when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability\".\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “Kai Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention “striker” qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fan’s claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference.\n\n“The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations. I think he’s an amazing example of that.”",

According to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

      "article_text": "A decision has been reached on APT rule amendments after Manchester City challenged the Premier League.\n\nIn June City launched unprecedented legal action against the Premier League in a bid to stop Associated Party Transaction rules which were brought in back in 2021.\n\nThe club claimed that previous rules were \"unlawful\" and submitted 165-page legal document ahead of a legal hearing where City achieved some success and were victorious in seven of their key arguments.\n\nIn order for the rules to be updated, 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs needed to be in favour of the proposed changes. However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n“Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens.\n\n\"You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds when speaking to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

      "article_text": "New Man United head coach Ruben Amorim could be set to hand one player his competitive debut for the club on Sunday.\n\nAmorim, 39, will take charge of his new side for the first time at Portman Road against Ipswich Town on Sunday, 24 November, having finally started in his new role on Monday, 11 November.\n\nAs expected, fans have paid close attention to training footage released by the club this week as they try to piece together his first starting XI - with the Portuguese having taken a liking to one winger in particular.\n\nDuring his successful spell at his former club, Sporting, he regularly employed a 3-4-3 formation - something that is not widely used by the current crop of Premier League managers.\n\nHis preferred tactic puts the emphasis on his defenders, with the full-backs made to work hard in both attack and defence to avoid exposing one of the three centre-backs.\n\nFormer United boss Erik ten Hag had a preferred centre-back pairing of Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez with Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans, and Victor Lindelof as back-up.\n\nHowever, this weekend, a forgotten man may come into the squad.\n\nAccording to reports from Daily Mail, Leny Yoro has featured during Amorim’s training drills this week and was even ‘pulled out’ of an Under-21 squad, who were due to face Altrincham on Tuesday.\n\nYoro, 19, joined United in a £52m deal after impressing for French club Lille during the 2023/24 Ligue 1 season.\n\nFans were excited at his arrival, but he sustained a fractured metatarsal while playing a game against Arsenal in pre-season, meaning he has failed to make his competitive debut for United.\n\nThe club announced that the defender returned to full first-team training in early November.\n\nWhether he is ‘match-fit’ is still unclear, but it is possible that Yoro could play a part in Sunday’s fixture.\n\nUpon joining United in July 2024, Yoro admitted that a former Red Devils and England defender ‘helped’ him make his choice of joining the club.\n\n\"He [Rio Ferdinand] called me,” Yoro told Manchester United’s official website. \"First of all, I was really impressed to speak with him and, yeah, we spoke like 10 minutes about Man United, so he helped me a lot to make my choice.\n\n“It was really an honour to speak with him. He spoke to me about the club, and that this is a historic club with a big story, and if I go there, I need to fight for the club, to be ready, because this is the biggest club in the world. For me, it was really good to speak about this.",

But although Amazon still have rights to some Champions League fixtures, they did not bid for the Premier League TV rights which come into effect from the 2025/26 season and lasts until the end of the 2028/29 campaign.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports will share packages after reaching a £6.7 billion rights agreement, the biggest in sports history.\n\nTyldesley is booked in for a clash between Brighton and Brentford on 27 December but he has admitted it could well be a final bow for him.\n\n\"What actually could be the final game I ever commentate for UK television is Brighton-Brentford,\" he told the Anfield Wrap podcast.\n\n\"That won't be dull. That's on 27 December. Amazon Prime, this is their final year, so the Premier League going forward is going back to a two-man cartel of Sky and TNT.\"\n\nGoing forward Sky Sports will show a minimum of 215 games live, with TNT slated for 52 matches. Tyldesley still has an existing deal with CBS Sports for Champions League commentary in the United States and does work for Rangers TV.\n\nBack in July, Tyldesley made it clear that he has no intention of hanging up his microphone just yet.\n\n\"All I can do is keeping reviewing my own standards, keep making myself available,\" he said on his podcast.\n\n\"If someone like CBS - who have given me a four-year contract to cover Champions League for the USA - show that sort of confidence in me then I can only assure you I will repay that faith by working bloody hard and trying to be as good as I can be.",

He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals.

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won.

Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge. \n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.",

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer.

      "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up. If you let up, it's over, then you'll go under.\"",

      "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
      "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\"\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n“If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

      "article_text": "**Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.**\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe.\"\n\nPorro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

      "article_text": "Real Madrid are ‘concerned’ that their pursuit of a Champions League winner could be hijacked by Manchester United.\n\nUnited are currently 13th in the Premier League but will be hoping their fortunes improve under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nHe will take charge of his game as head coach of the Red Devils when his side faces Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November.\n\nAs for Madrid, they have started the season in poor form by their high standards, with Los Blancos currently trailing league leaders Barcelona by six points, having sustained an embarrassing 4-0 loss against the Catalans on October 26.\n\nThe 15-time European Champions also sit 18th in the 36-team Champions League group phase, having suffered shock defeats against Lille and AC Milan.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s options have been ravaged by injuries in recent months, with key players Dani Carvajal and Eder Miltao both sustaining anterior cruciate ligament injuries, which will keep them out for the foreseeable future. David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option. Any reports suggesting otherwise are incorrect.”",

      "headline": "Man Utd players have already come up with a 'nickname' for Ruben Amorim after first training sessions",
      "article_text": "Manchester United’s players already have a ‘nickname’ for head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim, 39, arrived at the club’s Carrington Training Centre on Monday and was greeted by several members of the Red Devils’ hierarchy – including sporting director Dan Ashworth, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nOn the same day, he took charge of training for the first time, with the Portuguese having just ten senior players available due to the ongoing international break. As a result, several academy players joined in the session.\n\nAmad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town.\n\nFans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up.\n\nThe Sun reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence.\n\n“Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained. “Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence.\n\n“There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own. The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal. The 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, from day one, we will start with our identity. The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

      "headline": "Roy Keane reveals why he chose to wear 16 on his shirt at Man Utd after Sir Alex Ferguson offered him a different number",
      "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United. Keane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight. He also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play. Traditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993. \"Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,\" Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet. \n\n\"When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,\" he explained. \"Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.’ \n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].”\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t fucking want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along. The group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016. “Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

She’s human.\n\n“When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.”",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the [Liverpool Echo](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/trent-alexander-arnold-billboard-truth-30411807) explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.\n\n",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United are years away from the title",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has denied that being Manchester United’s head coach is the impossible job but says his two-and-a-half-year contract is not long enough to win the title.\n\nAmorim is United’s sixth permanent appointment since they were last Premier League champions, under Sir Alex Ferguson, in May 2013. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag failed to make them contenders. He was reminded of this and asked whether United was the impossible job.\n\n“No, of course not,” the 39-year-old said. “Call me naive but I believe I am the right guy at the right moment. I could be wrong but the Earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn’t matter, I’m not worried about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job. I really don’t know the biggest challenge here – I will find out during the next months.\n\n“I’m a little bit of a dreamer, and I believe in myself, I also believe in the club. We have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help, but I truly believe in the players also. I know you guys don’t believe a lot in these players. But I believe a lot. We have room to improve, I want to try new things. You guys think it’s not possible; I think it’s possible. We will see in the end.”\n\nAmorim is contracted until summer 2027 but believes longer is required to claim United a 21st title. \"I have two years and a half. In two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. We will need more time – if you look at the clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time.\n\n\"I understand we will need more than two and a half years. We have to win something, somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue this part with him or change.\n\n\"You have here different types of coaches: the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjær, then one of the best outside the top five leagues – Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we have to win games. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do the Ineos way, my way.”\n\nAmorim was asked why he had confidence in players whose form caused Ten Hag to be sacked. United are 13th but only four points behind third-placed Chelsea.\n\n“You have to believe and I believe in them,” he said. “When I start this week … you can say only one week training but they are open to different things. The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the idea.”\n\nHe accepts the squad has lost confidence. “That is for sure but normal. When players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up if they are confident or not. I have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half they will change so they have to find that mindset.”\n\nAmorim’s opening game is Sunday’s trip to Ipswich and he said he would stick with his 3-4-3 system. “As a coach you have to choose one way or another,” he said. “I always choose 100% our way. I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way.\n\n“We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.”\n\nAmorim wants a major influence regarding recruitment. “We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. It is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.\n\n“It is not the final word, but I have a great responsibility when we choose the players.”",

Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far.\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was at Casa Pia where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff were also formed there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier, and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach, you just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais. \n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

      "headline": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991)",
      "article_text": "It may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul.\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than _that_!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

      "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Ruben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!",

      "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane.\n\nSusanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it. \\[The air stewards\\] just called for help and help came.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

      "headline": "Ruud van Nistelrooy leaves Manchester United as Ruben Amorim checks in",
      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That’s going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim yet to be granted visa despite starting Manchester United job on Monday",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty, the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues about the future, so I expect to hear today or tomorrow.”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”\n\nSteve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. “Jamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn’t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,” the Leicester manager said. “Ricky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.",

      "headline": "Will Amorim change Manchester United or will his style alter due to the squad?",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has already flagged his greatest challenge when taking over Manchester United on Monday: to make the club of Billy Meredith, George Best, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo play again in the tradition of these irresistible attacking forces.\n\nThe “wow” factor has been missing from those donning United colours for most of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s off-the-cuff counterattack play apart, the teams of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Erik ten Hag lacked the dizzying fizz of United’s finest vintages.\n\nWhen Amorim declared after Sporting’s 4-1 Champions League rout of Manchester City on Tuesday night that United cannot play as defensively as the Portuguese champions, he signalled an intent to make his iteration a front-foot, box-office proposition.\n\nHis clear challenge is how to engineer this with a side in 13th place before the weekend’s fixtures – they host Leicester today – and with players unaccustomed to his preferred 3-4-3 configuration. \"[United cannot play the way we play](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/manchester-united-cannot-play-the-way-sporting-do-warns-ruben-amorim), they cannot be so defensive,\" he said after his Sporting side had sat back and waited to play on the break against Pep Guardiola’s City.\n\nHowever, Amorim often harnesses the counterattack against higher-quality opposition and you have to wonder if United will be markedly more attacking than Sporting were in midweek. How the Old Trafford crowd will receive this is another matter. Even Solskjær, who restored the bond between club and supporters broken by his predecessor, Mourinho, drew ire for playing on the break.\n\nUntil Amorim can start building the squad he desires, whether his United can excite in his first months in charge will depend on an inherited group of players that are not obviously suited to his direction.\n\nUnited have six central defenders so perming three for any matchday for the rearguard trident should be no problem. If his preferred lineup is Lisandro Martínez, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro (once fit), Amorim faces the question of whether they can initiate his tactics that build attacks from deep.\n\nIn the Portuguese’s middle quartet, the wing-backs at United will be called on to perform an unfamiliar role. At Sporting, Amorim has fielded the pacy Geovany Quenda on the left and Maximiliano Araújo on the right, inverted wing-backs operating on the opposing flank to their natural sides. At United Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are candidates as right-sided defenders whom Amorim could select on either flank. Beyond whether they are able to adapt to the position, it will be intriguing to see whether either has the pace required to operate expertly by sprinting back and forward in attack and defence.\n\nAmorim has a further problem regarding the reliability of two injury-plagued left-backs in Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The manager could plump for Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to patrol the corridors but neither are renowned for their defensive discipline.\n\nAntony may feel a flatlining United career has a chance of revival with a move to the position but, now in a third season at United, this seems an outside prospect. If this key part of the XI does not function, Amorim could consider a return to Sporting to sign one of Quenda and Araújo but with funds limited a January move may not be possible.\n\nCentral midfield presents another conundrum. If Amorim wishes to operate a flat four then he must find a way to fit in the two creative forces of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes. But there would be no room for either Manuel Ugarte, as a dedicated holding player, or Casemiro.\n\nA diamond formation may be the solution, with Ugarte or Casemiro at the base, plus wing-backs either side and Fernandes or Mainoo at the tip. But one of the latter two would miss out, which, for a team whose heritage demands buccaneering football, seems unlikely and contradicts Amorim’s own declaration that United should not be dour.\n\nHis front three seems the least complicated selection area. On either wing, he can pick two from Garnacho, Rashford and the ever-improving Amad Diallo, with Rasmus Højlund at centre-forward. But definitely far more involved is the requirement to solve the paucity of goals, a mere nine scored in 10 Premier League games.\n\nA calling card of the elite coach is how they adapt to the players already in their squad: footballers’ abilities come first, not the system.

I think we've done very well so far.'\n\nRúben Amorim will subsequently take over as permanent United manager but Van Nistelrooy is keen to stay at the club and work under the new head coach.

      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th of 36 in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now [to see if Amorim has messaged] – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want [for] my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me, it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea, and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room, it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put a big performance in.\n\n“The first half [against Paok] wasn’t good. We hardly created anything and Paok neither. We didn’t get going and our possession wasn’t good enough and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good, it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

        "headline": "'Dreamer' Amorim 'right guy' to revive Man Utd",
        "article_text": "New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he is the \"right man\" for the club but will need time to implement his ideas.\n\nThe 39-year-old signed a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month to replace Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October.\n\nUnited are 13th in the Premier League table, seven points above Sunday's opponents Ipswich Town, who are fourth from bottom.\n\nWhile Amorim recognises the size of the task facing him at Old Trafford, he believes he can turn the club's fortunes around.\n\n\"I'm a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself and I believe in the club,\" he said during his first news conference as head coach.\n\n\"I truly believe in the players, I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things. You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\n\n\"Call me naive, but I believe I am the right guy at the right time. I truly believe I am the right guy.\"\n\nThe Portuguese, who has joined United after four years at Sporting, insisted he will bring change in order for the club to challenge for the Premier League title again.\n\nHe added: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take.\"\n\nGiven his nationality and success in Portugal, Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho, who had spells in the Premier League with United, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nAmorim, though, was keen to play down the comparisons.\n\n\"I'm different from Mourinho, I remember that time,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n\n\"I think I'm right for now.\"\n\nYes, he will ultimately be judged by results on the pitch, but this was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nHowever, he also firmly rejected the suggestion this was 'the impossible job'. \"Of course not,\" he said.\n\nAmorim is the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford – so a lot is resting on him. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty - a senior director at the petrochemicals company - and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance.\n\nBased on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.",

        "headline": "Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules, published at 09:33",
        "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City.\n\nToday's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nAfter all, the changes the league was proposing - after a tribunal panel found elements of the APTs were unlawful - will weaken the rules. Clearly 16 clubs were loathe to loosen them even more.\n\nThe Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future.\n\nHowever, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiralling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote.\n\nLast week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules.\n\nThey feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nClarification from the tribunal is still to be received but City feel its recommendations will end up siding with them, which will effectively make today's vote irrelevant.\n\nBackground\n\nIn October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nManchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\n\nAfter the tribunal, City claimed the rules were void and they criticised the Premier League's misleading suggestion they could be swiftly amended.\n\nThe club threatened further legal action if there was a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nBut following meetings of its Legal Advisory Group and Financial Controls Advisory Group, the Premier League proposed several amendments before today's vote in London.\n\nCity argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League.",

        "article_text": "**We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.**\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\n_The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit._\n\nHow did last week's team do?\n----------------------------\n\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n----------------------\n\n**David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m**\n\n**Gabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m**\n\n**William Saliba, Arsenal, £6m**\n\n**All home to Nottingham Forest**\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\n**Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n--------\n\n**Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton**\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\n**Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich**\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\n**Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford**\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\n**Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves**\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n--------\n\n**Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\n**Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\n**Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth**\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n-----------\n\n**Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves**\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\n**Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton**\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\n**Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\n**Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton**\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\n**Total team cost = £98.5m**\n\nTeam to target\n--------------\n\n**Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)**\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

        "headline": "'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
        "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One'\n\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\n\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\n\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\n\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\n\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\n\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\n\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United? Morais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim criticises Manchester United players over three things",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim criticised Manchester United players' lack of work rate and stressed they have to \"be better running back\".\n\nAmorim was filmed during his first team training session at Carrington on Monday timing United's attacks and urging the players to run back faster.\n\nA number of United players have been accused of refusing to muck in in recent years. Former club captain Gary Neville questioned wingers Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho's willingness to track back earlier this month.\n\nIn a bullish and blunt summation of the United squad, Amorim stressed United had to \"improve the physical aspect\" and expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's ball retention.\n\n\"I think if you want to speak about the team, the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball,\" Amorim opined. \"We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody.\n\n\"And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things. I think it’s the small things and we are here to improve on the small things. The way we see football, play as a team, understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help a lot these players.\"\n\nAmorim also confirmed there is a willingness among the players to adapt to his favoured 3-4-3 formation. \"I think they want to play, in this first moment, they just want to play, so it’s easy.\n\n\"In the future, we will see. I have to understand. You can watch on TV, but you have to train with them to understand if they can cope with different positions. So we are in that phase.\n\n\"Everybody wants to play now, if they have an opportunity to play as a goalkeeper they will play in the moment! In the future, they will see. But they are open to change some positions.\n\n\"That’s for sure (that the players have lost belief) but this is normal in every team. When you don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. I cannot control the ball with pressure, so these small things, you start feeling in the players.\n\n\"You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up, you can feel if they are confident or not. So that is a normal thing. I think I have to help them to feel that. It will take time, but they are ready to cope with the demands of the Premier League because they have proved that.\n\n\"You can see even this year and last year sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half without any tactical change, they will turn up and change things. They have to find the mindset to play this way through all the game.\"\n\nAmorim admitted some players would have to be reinvented to adjust to his system but suggested there would not be radical changes to the starting XI in his first match in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\n\"As a coach, you have to choose one way or another. I choose always 100 per cent our way. I prefer to risk a little bit but to push in the first moment. Since the first day, I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe, too.\n\n\"So there is no second doubts, no second way. It’s one way and we are going to do it. We will adapt some players because we don't have the right profile. This team was built for a different system.\n\n\"But it's the same thing playing with five or four, the principles are the same. The positioning is a little bit different. But maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change. But you will feel it in the game during the positioning in the way they receive the ball, covering the ball, you will see some changes.",

        "article_text": "In Manchester and across the UK, pitch inspections are being scheduled after Storm Bert threatens football postponements. Multi-hazard storm system Storm Bert will hit the United Kingdom this weekend as football matches in Manchester and beyond face the threat of strong winds, heavy rain as well as snow and blizzards. \n\nManchester City host Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League at 5:30pm on Saturday, while games across the North West are set to take place amid an amber warning for snow and ice from the Met Office with numerous yellow warnings issued for rain and wind. \n\nIt is rare for Premier League matches to be postponed due to the advanced technology and state-of-the-art frost covers to prevent pitches from freezing when the temperatures drop and waterlogged pitches. \n\nThere is a full compliment of fixtures scheduled in each tier of England's football pyramid with the top-flight, second division and some League One fixtures returning following the international break. \n\nYellow warnings in place from 5am to 7pm on Saturday have been issued with winds of up to 60 miles per hour expected across Scotland and parts of northern England. While, southern England is expected to feel the gale forces later on Saturday with gusts of up to 70mph around the south coast until 9pm on Sunday. \n\nThe environment agency has warned heavy rain could lead to localised flooding with a yellow warning in place across the south-west and central England and Wales for rainfall up to 70mm. In parts of Dartmoor and south Wales, it has been suggested that the average rainfall for the whole of November could fall in just a day. \n\nKeep up to date with the Manchester Evening News live-blog for updates on the latest news and updates regarding football across the country. \n\nNational League match between Halifax Town and Sutton United has been postponed due to a frozen pitch.  \n\nAn amber cold alert is also in place for much of England until 6pm on Saturday, meaning there is an increased health risk to vulnerable people. \n\nMet Office spokesman Oli Claydon said Storm Bert: \"Because of the different nature of the weather across the UK, people really need to have an idea of what the forecast is for them specifically.

        "headline": "Every word from Ruben Amorim press conference as Man United boss spoke to media for first time",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has held his inaugural press conference as Man United head coach.\n\nRuben Amorim faced the media as Manchester United head coach for the very first time at Carrington this afternoon to look ahead to Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on November 1, arrived in England on November 11 and started work on the training ground with his players at the beginning of this week.\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon chief, who is keen to install a new identity at Old Trafford, will be itching to make a winning start at Portman Road this weekend and begin the process of turning United's fortunes around.\n\nUnited did not present Amorim to the media at an official unveiling after his arrival in England last week, meaning his pre-match press conference this afternoon was his first meeting with the British media.\n\nHe was quizzed on a wide range of topics, including his style of football, his timeline for success, how involved he will be in United's recruitment and messages he has exchanged with Jose Mourinho.\n\nJose Mourinho sent Ruben Amorim a message after he took over as the inaugural head coach of Manchester United.\n\n\"He sent me a message,\" Amorim said. \"He told me it’s a lovely club, big club, with lovely people and that is correct, it is. But a lot of things have changed. We are in a diff building now (at Carrington), we are building a new one. I’m a different guy. I was learning at the time and I hope to teach my players but the club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win.\"\n\nRuben Amorim criticised Manchester United players' lack of work rate and stressed they have to \"be better running back\".\n\nIn a bullish and blunt summation of the United squad, Amorim stated that United had to \"improve the physical aspect\" and expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's ball retention.\n\n\"I think if you want to speak about the team, the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball,\" Amorim opined.\n\n\"We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody. And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things. I think it’s the small things and we are here to improve on the small things. The way we see football, play as a team, understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help a lot these players.\"\n\nAmorim stressed he can be fairly judged within his first two years whether he is a credible enough coach to make United a force again.\n\n\"I have two and a half years of contract and you guys talk about that! I think two years, you can understand if I’m the right manager to go in this process. I think we will need more time because if you look to the other clubs that are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time but they are winning, that is why they have time to do this project. I understand that we will need more than two and a half years, we will have to win something somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue in this path or you change. We will see how long it will be.\n\nWe have space to grow as a team and we need to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing in the middle of the season with a different way of playing. We need to improve the physical aspect of the team. I don't know how long it will take but I know we need to win games at Manchester United. I will not tell you we need a lot of time but we need to improve a lot to win titles.\"\n\nAmorim feels aligned with the views of Manchester United and believes in the club's potential.\n\n\"I am a dreamer and I believe in myself. I believe in the club and we have the same idea and same mindset. I think we have room to improve and I want to try new things.\"\n\nHe confirmed, \"We will play our way. As a coach you have to choose one way or another. I choose always 100% our way. If they feel like since the first day that I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. It is one way and we are going to do it. We may need to adapt some players who were bought to play a different system but on Sunday you will see the starting XI and you will feel a lot of change in the positioning and the way they receive the ball.\"\n\nAmorim also commented on maintaining player confidence, stating, \"When you don't win games you start to get suspicious of the way of playing. You start feeling it in the players when they walk to the warm-up. You can feel if they are confident or not. That is normal.\"\n\nIn summary, Amorim is set to instill change at Manchester United, focusing on physicality, player development, and a distinct playing style as he prepares for his Premier League debut this weekend. \n\nKey events from the press conference included his focus on player recruitment, performance improvement, and confidence building among players as they adapt to his management style.",

Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony.\n\nQuickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to. They're not ready.\"\n\nRodri has been out of action since sustaining a knee ligament injury in a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on September 22.\n\nNow, the Spanish midfielder has finally spoke out about the Ballon d’Or debacle.\n\n“I think he’s a smart guy and with time you’ll realize that the more you pay attention on the field, the better he [Vini Jr] will be,\" Rodri told Spanish TV programme [El Largeuro](https://x.com/ellarguero).\n\n“Athletes are not just what you represent on the field, but also off it.”\n\nBut it was Vini Jr's Brazil teammate Neymar who could not help but give his thoughts on Rodri's words with a five-word dig in the comment section of [Futeousadia](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCp5PtCoSBm/?igsh=MXc5dzJ1aDJpOHVmOQ%3D%3D)'s Instagram post.\n\nThe Al Hilal man commented: \"Virou falador agora (he becomes a talker now - in English).\"\n\nNeymar previously referred to the Real Madrid man as a \"great idol\" and \"hero\" for the people of Brazil even explaining how he didn't \"think there's anyone but him [Vini Jr] to win it [Ballon d'Or]\" when speaking to SNTV [Via [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/neymar-brazil-vinicius-jr-award_sto20046022/story.shtml)] in October.\n\nThe former Barcelona man has also never won the Ballon d’Or despite arguably being one of the best players over the last 15 years.\n\nIn Neymar’s case, he was up against the seemingly unstoppable Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with this year’s nominee list being the only one to not feature one of the pairing since 2003.",

        "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?\" by the club’s social media channels when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability\".\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “Kai Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention “striker” qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fan’s claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference.\n\n“The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations. I think he’s an amazing example of that.”",

        "article_text": "Ally McCoist has opened up on living with Dupuytren’s contracture; an incurable condition that causes his fingers to bend towards his palms.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Rangers striker, who recently received an OBE for services to football and broadcasting, is arguably one of the most popular pundits in the game through his work with Amazon Prime, TNT Sports and ITV.\n\nHe is also a regular on radio station talkSPORT and this week, McCoist revealed that he is suffering from an incurable condition that impacts his everyday life.\n\nDupuytren's contracture, also known as Viking disease, is an abnormal thickening of the skin in the palm of the hand which can cause the fingers to curl towards the palm or pull sideways.\n\nIt has been given the name Viking disease due to its prevalence in the north of Europe and those of Northern European descent. According to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“...the amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“...the Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

But although Amazon still have rights to some Champions League fixtures, they did not bid for the Premier League TV rights which come into effect from the 2025/26 season and lasts until the end of the 2028/29 campaign.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports will share packages after reaching a £6.7 billion rights agreement, the biggest in sports history.\n\nTyldesley is booked in for a clash between Brighton and Brentford on 27 December but he has admitted it could well be a final bow for him.\n\n\"What actually could be the final game I ever commentate for UK television is Brighton-Brentford,\" he told the Anfield Wrap podcast.\n\n\"That won't be dull. That's on 27 December. Amazon Prime, this is their final year, so the Premier League going forward is going back to a two-man cartel of Sky and TNT.\"\n\nGoing forward Sky Sports will show a minimum of 215 games live, with TNT slated for 52 matches. Tyldesley still has an existing deal with CBS Sports for Champions League commentary in the United States and does work for Rangers TV.\n\nBack in July, Tyldesley made it clear that he has no intention of hanging up his microphone just yet.\n\n\"All I can do is keeping reviewing my own standards, keep making myself available,\" he said on his podcast.\n\n\"If someone like CBS - who have given me a four-year contract to cover Champions League for the USA - show that sort of confidence in me then I can only assure you I will repay that faith by working bloody hard and trying to be as good as I can be.",

        "article_text": "**Lyon winger Rayan Cherki's stats have been compared to Premier League talents Cole Palmer and Phil Foden amid his transfer links to Liverpool.**\n\nLast week it was reported that Liverpool were considering making a move for French winger Cherki as a potential replacement to superstar Mohamed Salah if they are unable to agree on a new deal for the Egyptian.\n\nThe 21-year-old has impressed in recent years, drawing attention from some of the biggest clubs across Europe, including Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBut how would Cherki compare with the links of some of the best young talents in the Premier League if he were to secure a move to Liverpool in the summer?\n\nThroughout his career, the 21-year-old attacker has been compared to Eden Hazard due to his style of play, abilities with both feet and his physical build, but when considering his stats against players like Palmer and Foden, we learn a lot about Cherki.\n\nSo far this season, stars provided by Opta, via Squawka, show that Cherki has made seven domestic appearances for the Ligue One side, scoring one goal and assisting another, while averaging 0.8 shots on target per 90 minutes played.\n\nMeanwhile Foden is yet to score a Premier League goal this season despite featuring in eight matches for reigning champions Manchester City.\n\nThe Englishman, who has over 100 minutes more than Cherki this season, has one assist in the League so far and averages just 0.2 shots on target per 90.\n\nFar in front of both Cherki and Foden in terms of stats this season is Chelsea superstar Palmer, who has scored an impressive seven goals and assisted five in 11 Premier League appearances.\n\nAnd, while the 22-year-old has enjoyed considerably more minutes than either Cherki or Foden, he boasts the most shots on target per 90 minutes with an average of 1.3.\n\nDespite this, according to FBref, Cherki ranks very well when compared with other wingers and attacking midfielders across Europe's top five leagues for expected assists and shot-creating actions.\n\nHe also sits in the 97th percentile for progressive passes and compares well against players like Leroy Sane and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHowever, Cherki is very low in terms of defensive metrics, but this could be due to Lyon's style of play.",

        "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to the Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not typical goal scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create the space for them.”",

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won.

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge. \n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper.

        "headline": "Man Utd 'make contact' with European giants for first January signing as Ruben Amorim stamps his mark",
        "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up. If you let up, it's over, then you'll go under.\"",

        "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\"\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n“If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

        "article_text": "**Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.**\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe.\"\n\nPorro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid?

As a result, several academy players joined in the session.\n\nAmad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town.\n\nFans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up.\n\nThe Sun reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence.\n\n“Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained. “Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence.\n\n“There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own. The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal. The 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, from day one, we will start with our identity.

        "headline": "Roy Keane reveals why he chose to wear 16 on his shirt at Man Utd after Sir Alex Ferguson offered him a different number",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United. Keane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight. He also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play. Traditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993. \"Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,\" Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.  \n\n\"When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,\" he explained. \"Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.’  \n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].”\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t fucking want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along. The group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016. “Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

        "article_text": "**Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.**\n\nAn official statement from the BBC confirmed that Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\nJenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'.\n\nAnd now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family.\n\n“My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy.\n\n“Now I just want to move forward.\n\n“Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.”\n\nDespite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future.\n\n\"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added.\n\n\"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future.\n\n“He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.”\n\nWhen details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie.\n\nHe said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault.\n\n“The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family.\n\n“There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.”\n\n“Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human.\n\n“When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.”",

        "article_text": "***Liverpool fans have made their mind up about Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid after seeing what just appeared in the Spanish capital.***\n\n[Alexander-Arnold](https://www.sportbible.com/trent-alexander-arnold), 26, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be able to start talks with foreign clubs from January 1, 2025.\n\nThe [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) man has played an integral part in the club's early season success under new boss Arne Slot - the Reds currently sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, arguably the biggest negative surrounding the club is the contractual situation of Alexander-Arnold, [Mohamed Salah](https://www.sportbible.com/football/transfer-news/liverpool-arne-slot-premier-league-889266-20241120), and [Virgil van Dijk](https://www.sportbible.com/virgil-van-dijk) – all three are out of contract at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nAlthough there is no doubting the ability of Van Dijk and Salah, the ages – 33 and 32, respectively – of the players could be a sticking point in contract negotiations.\n\nHowever, with Alexander-Arnold at 26 and arguably approaching his peak, losing him, especially without receiving a transfer fee, would be far from ideal for the Reds.\n\nAlthough the situation is still unclear, Liverpool supporters were shocked when they came across a giant advert of the player in Madrid, posted to X by [Anfield Wrap](https://x.com/TheAnfieldWrap/status/1859185827655385505).\n\nThe Liverpool defender was pictured alongside model and actress Iris Law for a shoot for fashion brand 'Guess' on a billboard, which was emblazoned on the side of a building located at Plaza Felipe II – the place where thousands of Liverpool fans gathered ahead of their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final held in the city.\n\nWhat do Liverpool fans think?\n\nFans were quick to offer their thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOne fan said: “If he goes, he goes, [it] won't go down well with LFC fans if he walks away for nothing. I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the [Liverpool Echo](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/trent-alexander-arnold-billboard-truth-30411807) explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.\n\n",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United are years away from the title",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has denied that being Manchester United’s head coach is the impossible job but says his two-and-a-half-year contract is not long enough to win the title.\n\nAmorim is United’s sixth permanent appointment since they were last Premier League champions, under Sir Alex Ferguson, in May 2013. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag failed to make them contenders. He was reminded of this and asked whether United was the impossible job.\n\n“No, of course not,” the 39-year-old said. “Call me naive but I believe I am the right guy at the right moment. I could be wrong but the Earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn’t matter, I’m not worried about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job. I really don’t know the biggest challenge here – I will find out during the next months.\n\n“I’m a little bit of a dreamer, and I believe in myself, I also believe in the club. We have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help, but I truly believe in the players also. I know you guys don’t believe a lot in these players. But I believe a lot. We have room to improve, I want to try new things. You guys think it’s not possible; I think it’s possible. We will see in the end.”\n\nAmorim is contracted until summer 2027 but believes longer is required to claim United a 21st title. \"I have two years and a half. In two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. We will need more time – if you look at the clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time.\n\n\"I understand we will need more than two and a half years. We have to win something, somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue this part with him or change.\n\n\"You have here different types of coaches: the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjær, then one of the best outside the top five leagues – Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we have to win games. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do the Ineos way, my way.”\n\nAmorim was asked why he had confidence in players whose form caused Ten Hag to be sacked. United are 13th but only four points behind third-placed Chelsea.\n\n“You have to believe and I believe in them,” he said. “When I start this week … you can say only one week training but they are open to different things. The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the idea.”\n\nHe accepts the squad has lost confidence. “That is for sure but normal. When players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up if they are confident or not. I have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half they will change so they have to find that mindset.”\n\nAmorim’s opening game is Sunday’s trip to Ipswich and he said he would stick with his 3-4-3 system. “As a coach you have to choose one way or another,” he said. “I always choose 100% our way. I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way.\n\n“We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.”\n\nAmorim wants a major influence regarding recruitment. “We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. It is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.\n\n“It is not the final word, but I have a great responsibility when we choose the players.”",

        "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Ruben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim’s rise in management has been rapid in a relatively short time. Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far.\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was at Casa Pia where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff were also formed there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier, and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach, you just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais. \n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

        "headline": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991)",
        "article_text": "It may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul.\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than _that_!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

        "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Ruben Amorim",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!",

After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it. [The air stewards] just called for help and help came.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That’s going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim yet to be granted visa despite starting Manchester United job on Monday",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty, the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues about the future, so I expect to hear today or tomorrow.”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”\n\nSteve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. “Jamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn’t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,” the Leicester manager said. “Ricky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.",

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th of 36 in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now [to see if Amorim has messaged] – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want [for] my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me, it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea, and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room, it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put a big performance in.\n\n“The first half [against Paok] wasn’t good. We hardly created anything and Paok neither. We didn’t get going and our possession wasn’t good enough and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good, it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

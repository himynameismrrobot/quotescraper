He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him.

I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and heâd beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didnât have that instinctive finish in him every time. But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. Heâs developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, itâs similar to how he played back then.",

Heâs dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and Iâm not even exaggerating. There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him. He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that.

He would have played for Burnleyâs first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background.

Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents stadiums, whether the game was in England. Europe or during the summer tours. I always enjoyed meeting Manchester United fans throughout the world. Walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in England, Europe, Asia, Australia, the USA - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity. That's what makes United supporters so special. I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad. We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end. I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.",

It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.

I feel Carreras is doing well at Benfica because of the trust Lage has put in him, and because he has been able to win the hearts of the fans with his performances. Playing at Old Trafford, where he didn't have the best of times, endured rejection, albeit normal for the process of a young player, may be something that will weigh on his psyche, but we are also talking about a 21 year old Carreras who has evolved mentally with the experiences he's had.",

Although he was a great striker, I didnât think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher. I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and heâd beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didnât have that instinctive finish in him every time. But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. Heâs developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, itâs similar to how he played back then.",

Some of the things Iâve seen him do for United, heâs been doing since back then. Heâs dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and Iâm not even exaggerating. There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him. He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I canât think of many times he didn't have a good day.",

We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.

If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasnât a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability. He would have played for Burnleyâs first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background.

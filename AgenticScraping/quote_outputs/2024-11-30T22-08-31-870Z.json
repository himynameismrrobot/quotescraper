Ruben Amorim has become the latest manager to be tasked with restoring Manchester United's on-pitch fortunes.\n    \n    The club paid £11m to Portuguese club Sporting to recruit the 39-year-old and his staff, making him the sixth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year reign ended with his retirement in 2013.\n    \n    After a draw at Ipswich and a win against Bodo/Glimt in his first two games, his side host Everton on Sunday (13:30 GMT).\n    \n    BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman caught up with the Portuguese manager on Football Focus, firstly asking him if he is already feeling a connection with the Manchester United fans.\n    \n    \"Yes for sure, I feel that\" Amorim revealed. \"Maybe because I'm a little bit of an emotional person.

Gabriel flicked home a brilliant corner to score his fourth of the campaign.\n\nWith Arsenal 4-2 up, Gabriel looked to grab a brace from yet another corner but was instead caught with a flying arm by West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski as he tried to clear his lines. It was clear that the Brazilian was in some pain as Anthony Taylor awarded the penalty.\n\nThings would become even more concerning for Arsenal when Gabriel was substituted at half-time. Jakub Kiwior came on in his place as the Gunners saw out the victory.\n\nMikel Arteta will no doubt be concerned that Gabriel will have suffered a concussion after the clash with Fabianski particularly with Manchester United on the horizon for the Gunners next. The 26-year-old did return to the pitch after the final whistle all smiles as he clapped the travelling away supporters.\n\nHowever, this is by no means confirmation that he will be able to feature against United in midweek. Before Ruben Amorim can look at who may or may not be available for Arsenal next week, he has to focus on the Reds' next opponent, Everton.\n\nAfter Saturday's results, victory over Sean Dyche's men could see the Reds move to within four points of the Champions League spots. Following Arsenal, the Reds will return to Old Trafford to host Nottingham Forest.",

        "article_text": "I fired Manchester United to the Treble - but Sir Alex Ferguson told me I was a failure\n\nMan United's historic 1998/99 Treble-winning campaign was made possible by the goals of Dwight Yorke - but the moment his standards dropped, Sir Alex Ferguson made him know about it.\n\nBy George Smith Senior Football Writer\n\n04:00, 30 NOV 2024\n\nAfter winning back-to-back Premier League titles in 1996 and 1997, imagine the frustration Manchester United must have felt at missing out on a third successive crown in 1998 by a single point.\n\nUnited had won four of the first five Premier League titles, scooping two either side of being pipped to the 1995 crown by Blackburn Rovers. The Lancashire outfit, who were under the stewardship of Sir Kenny Dalglish at the time, beat United to top spot by a single point. It was the exact same scenario when Arsenal pipped United to the summit in 1998.\n\nUnited ended the 1997/98 season having won just the Community Shield. They exited the FA Cup at the fifth round stage, bowed out of the League Cup at the third round stage and said farewell to the Champions League at the quarter-final stage.\n\nIt meant United, during the summer of 1998, had to come up with the plan for how they could wrestle back the Premier League title and become a stronger force in Europe. Sir Alex Ferguson decided loosening the purse strings in the transfer market would help his team's case.\n\nJaap Stam was the first statement signing of the summer, arriving from PSV Eindhoven to strengthen the defence, before Trinidad and Tobago international Dwight Yorke arrived from Aston Villa. United signed the striker in a deal worth north of £12.5million two days before their second Premier League game of the campaign.\n\nYorke had established himself as one of the Premier League's most reliable goalscorers, scoring 46 times across the three proceeding Premier League campaigns prior to moving to Old Trafford. He scored 17 goals apiece in 1995/96 and 1996/97. and netted 12 in 1997/98.\n\nUnited, understandably, felt Yorke was what was the missing link in their quest to try and reclaim the Premier League title. The now-53-year-old soon hit the ground running in Manchester, scoring twice on his home debut in a 4-1 win over Charlton Athletic.\n\nThose two strikes were the first of 29 goals Yorke plundered in his maiden season at United - and 18 of them were scored in the Premier League. His goals contributed to United reclaiming the Premier League title, beating Arsenal to it by a single point.\n\nOf Yorke's 18 league goals that season, a third of them directly earned United 11 points. Without them, they would have finished fourth.\n\nAs well as scoring 18 goals en route to United reclaiming the Premier League crown, the striker, who spent four years at United, also netted eight goals to help the club win the Champions League, and plundered three to help them scoop the FA Cup.\n\nTo say United got their money's worth is an understatement. Yorke ended the season as the club's leading goalscorer, netting five more than his nearest rival, Andy Cole.\n\nHaving blossomed in his first season at Old Trafford, helping United clinch a famous Treble, Ferguson challenged Yorke to build on his 1998/99 tally of 29 goals the following season. However, the former Sunderland man fell short of reaching the target Ferguson set him, resulting in him being given a response you came to expect from Ferguson, whose demands were sky-high.\n\n\"In the first season I scored 29 goals, in the second year I scored 26, and the gaffer said to me 'you're a failure',\" Yorke recalled. \"I was top scorer again and we won the Premier League, but he said I was a failure.\n\n\"But you look back and I get where he was coming from. This is where you need to push yourself even further by getting more than 29.\n\n\"You look at [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo and that's the kind of levels he's trying to push you to, but I didn't see it then. Finishing as the top scorer with 26 goals was very rewarding for me, but the gaffer wasn't too pleased.  \n  \n\"Then in my third year I had 14 goals from 22 starts, which is not a bad return. But that wasn't good enough at United. That was the level the manager was demanding of you and I get it now.\"\n\nFresh from winning the Treble in 1998/99, United won the Premier League crown again the following season, winning it at a canter. They won 28 of their 38 matches, amassing 91 points to finish 18 clear of second-placed Arsenal.\n\nYorke was once again their leading marksman in the league, scoring 20 goals in 32 appearances. He was, as his numbers demonstrated, often reliable in front of goal.\n\nHowever, Ferguson, just as Yorke has documented, was not pleased by the fact the now-Trinidad and Tobago boss allowed his overall output to slip. Yorke, though, felt he could have scored even more goals than the 29 he did get in his first season in M16.\n\n\"I should have scored more goals,\" he continued. \"I was disappointed I only scored 29 goals, even though that was unbelievable in my first year.\n\n\"I think the manager robbed me of a few games when I felt I should have played and could have scored goals! He substituted me when I was on the verge of scoring a hat-trick. I was on two goals and he takes me off to have a rest! You look back and think 'bloody hell, gaffer, you robbed me of a few goals over the years'.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Yorke, he never managed to replicate the standards he hit in his first season at United, with his attacking output declining year-on-year. His final season at Old Trafford (2001/02) saw him score just one goal. It resulted in him being offloaded in July 2002 and sealing a move to Blackburn Rovers. He spent two years at Ewood Park before going on to have spells at Birmingham City, Sydney FC and Sunderland.\n\nAlthough his career fizzled out towards its conclusion, his exploits in the 1998/99 Treble-winning campaign will never be forgotten in M16.",

According to journalist Alfredo Pedulla, United are still monitoring the Brazilian ahead of a potential move either in January or next summer.\n\nThe report claims that United would prefer to sign Ederson at the end of the season when the summer transfer window opens. Atalanta are reported to have set an asking price of €60million (£50million) for the midfielder.\n\nIt has been reported that United are determined to sign a new midfielder to strengthen Amorim's squad. Ederson has been identified as the ideal target, and the club will continue to monitor the 25-year-old throughout the rest of the campaign.\n\nElsewhere, United are being linked with a move for Juventus duo Douglas Luiz and Nicolo Fagioli. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Serie A club are weighing up the possibility of allowing the midfield duo to leave the club in 2025.\n\nThe report claims that Juventus sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has already travelled to Manchester with the purpose of trying to agree deals for Luiz and Fagioli's exits. It has been reported that United are a potential destination for both players, as are Man City, with a move in January a realistic possibility.",

        "article_text": "Joshua Zirkzee has been linked with a move away from Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nIt’s back to Premier League action for Manchester United this weekend as Ruben Amorim takes charge of his first league game at Old Trafford. The new United head coach managed his first game at the Stadium on Thursday night. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund (x2) saw the team come out as 3-2 winners over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nUnited are back in action on Sunday when they take on Everton at Old Trafford (1.30pm kick-off). Going into the match, United sit in 12th place in the Premier League table, having picked up 16 points from their opening 12 games.\n\n**READ MORE: Manchester United duo show true Ruud van Nistelrooy feelings after new job confirmed**\n\n**READ MORE: Ruud van Nistelrooy first words as new job confirmed and Man United reunion date set**\n\nWhile we wait for the match, there has, as ever, been stories doing the rounds at Old Trafford. We have therefore taken a look at a couple and also given our own thoughts on the situation.\n\n#### Van Nistelrooy new job confirmed\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy has been confirmed as the new manager of Leicester City, following his exit from Manchester United just under three weeks ago. The former striker joined United in the summer as Erik ten hag’s assistant and took interim charge for four games following the sacking of Ten Hag. He has now signed a two-and-a-half year deal with the Foxes and will hope to lead the club to Premier League safety. It means a reunion with United is on the cards, with the meeting between the two clubs set for March 15 at the King Power Stadium.\n\n_**MEN Sport Says**: After a successful stint as interim boss, it’s good to see Van Nistelrooy get a chance to manage in the Premier League and United fans will be watching how he gets on with interest. United could also make the most of the new link between the two clubs in the transfer window._\n\n_Leicester may be keen to take some of United’s players either on loan (they will however have to free up a loan space in their squad in order to do so), or permanent deals. The link could be useful to both teams going forward and provides a new option for players struggling to break through at Old Trafford._\n\n#### Joshua Zirkzee stance outlined\n\nAhead of the January transfer window, there has been a lot of talk over Joshua Zirkzee, with Juventus linked with an interest in a potential loan deal just six months after he joined the club. However, journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has now given the latest, confirming that a move to the Italian giants is not going to happen. “Joshua Zirkzee and Douglas Luiz are linked to other teams every day,” he told Soccernews.nl.\n\n“Zirkzee to Juventus or Douglas Luiz back to the Premier League or Saudi Arabia, but they are out of the market at this moment. There are no chances or no discussion between Man Utd and the agent or Juventus and the agent, so they are happy to stay in Man Utd and Juventus. They want to stay at their clubs and demonstrate their values, so that´s not going to happen in January.”\n\n_**MEN Sport Says:** While Zirkzee has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford, I think it’s best for the striker that he stays at United, especially given the arrival of Ruben Amorim. While he is struggling for starts, Zirkzee is still yet to miss a Premier League game this season, so it’s not like he’s not getting any game time._\n\n_Working under Amorim will only benefit the 23-year-old. And he will hope to reap the benefits both the rest of the season and next season._",

        "article_text": "The latest Manchester United news as the former striker and United coach has joined Leicester City as first team manager.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy has become the new manager of Leicester City following his exit from Manchester United. The United legend has signed a deal until 2027, and will take charge of his first game when West Ham visit the King Power Stadium on Tuesday night. He will have a watching brief for the weekend’s clash against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.\n\nHis arrival at Leicester comes after he spent the first part of the season as assistant to Erik ten Hag at United. Van Nistelrooy then took interim charge of the team for four games following the sacking of Ten Hag.\n\nIn those games, United won three and drew just one. Ironically, two of the wins came against Leicester, a 5-2 victory in the Carabao Cup and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\n\nLeicester made the decision to make a managerial change on Sunday when they parted ways with Steve Cooper. Van Nistelrooy was quickly linked with the role, with confirmation of his appointment coming on Friday night.\n\nUnited players were said to be impressed with the Dutchman during his time coaching at Old Trafford. And two members of the United squad have shown that with their activity on social media. Both defender Harry Maguire and winger Amad have ‘liked’ Leicester’s official announcement of Van Nistelrooy’s appointment on social media. Maguire also has a link between the two clubs with the defender playing for Leicester for two seasons before joining United.\n\nSpeaking about his appointment at Leicester, Van Nistelrooy said: \"I’m proud, I’m excited. Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic.\n\n\"They have great stories about the quality of the people working at the club, the supporters and, of course, the recent history of the club is impressive. I’m excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.\n\n\"It’s also something I hear a lot about. I can’t wait to find that out, to be part of the Club, in a manager role, which is a big responsibility. I take it very seriously. Also, getting to know everybody, the community and the supporters, I can only imagine what it means to them. I want to feel it.”",

The Telegraph write that Amorim has assigned individual team members to cover defence, midfield, and attack, enabling players to quickly get to grips with his tactical vision.\n\nHe's brought a sizeable backroom squad to Old Trafford, including assistant Carlos Fernandes, goalkeeping expert Jorge Vital, along with Adelio Candido, Emanuel Ferro, and Paulo Barreira. Meanwhile, coaches Darren Fletcher and Andreas Georgson, plus assistant goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson, continue their roles from Erik ten Hag's tenure.\n\nIn an unconventional move, assistant Fernandes isn't orchestrating training as per tradition; instead, Amorim's appointees are zeroing in on specific player groups as a short-term strategy.\n\nAfter leading the team to a narrow 3-2 Europa League victory over Bodo/Glimt—securing his maiden win since a debut draw against Ipswich—Amorim expressed how treasured his Old Trafford reception was despite being less known. He shared his heartfelt observation, saying: \"The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn't really know me. I came from Portugal – I did nothing for this club yet. So the way they make me feel at home, it's so special, you know, it's not after something, it's before something.\n\n\"This is something special. And I will keep this to the end of my career. It's a special moment in my career, I hope it will be one of the many games here. It's a great crowd, great supporters,\" reports the Mirror.\n\n\"They are hungry for wins, that's what we want to give them. One more win in Europe, improve the team, show them what we are working on.\"\n\nUnited are set to welcome struggling Everton on Sunday afternoon, with Amorim eyeing his first league victory. Despite sitting 12th in the table after twelve matches, they are just six points shy of fourth place as the weekend fixtures approach.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's first Man United transfer move could hand Man City millions\n\nManchester United are reportedly considering a move for Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap in 2025 after his impressive start to life in the Premier League.\n\nBy Isaac Seelochan Senior Sport Central Audience Writer Tom Sunderland Sports Writer\n\nManchester United have been linked with Liam Delap as Ruben Amorim eyes his first signing at Old Trafford. The Reds are said to be eyeing up Ipswich Town's Liam Delap, who has been in scintillating form since his move from Manchester City. The 21-year-old striker, who had loan spells at Stoke City and Preston before a standout stint at Hull City, has netted six times in his first 13 Premier League games for Ipswich.\n\nHowever, should United make a move for Delap, City would benefit from a 20 percent sell-on clause in his contract. This means that Pep Guardiola's side would receive a portion of any future transfer fee, regardless of where he ends up. Delap's value is likely to have increased significantly after proving his worth in the top flight this season.\n\nThe son of former Stoke star Rory Delap, he played a crucial role in Ipswich's first-ever Premier League win over Tottenham and scored twice in a draw with Aston Villa, as well as netting an equaliser against Fulham.\n\nAmorim experienced first-hand the skills of Delap during his United dugout debut at Portman Road, where his team were held to a 1-1 draw. The Winchester-born talent nearly scored with two shots on target despite only taking 17 touches against United, with only Marcus Rashford taking fewer.\n\nInterest in Delap has emerged just as Rasmus Hojlund is beginning to shine under Amorim. The Dane netted twice and provided an assist as United defeated Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, securing their second victory of the Europa League campaign.\n\nHojlund, also 21, aims to justify his £72m transfer fee by emulating the success Viktor Gyokeres enjoyed under Amorim at Sporting CP. United also have striker options in Rashford and summer recruit Joshua Zirkzee, although neither has managed to maintain consistent form this season.\n\nIt seems unlikely City will exercise their buy-back clause to reunite with Delap given their striker position is covered. Erling Haaland continues to top the Premier League goal charts with 12 goals so far this term and is rumoured to be signing a new lucrative contract at the Etihad. Having experienced top-tier football under McKenna, Delap won't want to play a secondary role should he move next year. However, depending on his new value, United may have to indirectly give their fierce rivals a substantial sum if they wish to secure the player.",

The Brazilian, who has been linked with a move to United, has been in fine form this season, scoring seven goals and adding three assists in 12 matches.\n\nCunha, 25, has two-and-a-half years on his contract having joined Wolves, initially on loan from Atletico Madrid, in January 2023. However, there has been speculation over his future with United 'monitoring' his situation following his excellent start to the campaign.\n\nA number of other teams are expected to be interested in Cunha, but Wolves are trying their best to keep him.

Garnacho has started both of Amorim's games in charge and has made 20 appearances across all competitions for the Reds so far this season.\n\nThe Argentine was berated by a supporter outside Old Trafford before United's 3-0 win over Leicester City earlier this month. The supposed 'fan' was recording a live stream while players arrived at the tunnel and told Garnacho to improve parts of his game, to which he bit back with a comment of his own.\n\nAnd the winger may have hinted at the incident in his latest message on Instagram. \"I will keep doing my things,\" he wrote alongside several pictures of him in action on Thursday. And United will no doubt be hoping he will continue 'doing his own things' after the Argentine's goal on Thursday helped to move United up to 12th in the Europa League league phase table.\n\nUnder the competition's revised structure, the top eight teams will advance directly to the round of 16, while those ranked ninth to 24th will enter a seeded play-off round. It's not the first time that Garnacho has fired back at his detractors.\n\nThe forward sent a since-deleted sharp reply after receiving a harsh video critique after United's 3-0 defeat to Liverpool in September. The clip, which lampooned the player's mistakes, teasingly suggested: \"Alejandro Garnacho - Getafe's next star?\"\n\nGarnacho quickly hit back after spotting the video, replying with the pointed remark: \"Wasting your time making clips for me. Your life so far?\" Before reconsidering and promptly deleting his response.",

        "article_headline": "Man United icon Wayne Rooney suffers huge setback as Plymouth thumped again",
        "article_text": "Rooney has been plying his trade down south - and it's been a tough watch with his Plymouth Argyle side struggling after a 4-0 defeat to Bristol City in the Championship.\n\nEx-Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has struggled to find the spark that would ignite his managerial career so far, with short stints at Derby County, Birmingham City and Major League Soccer side DC United ending in misery. The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\n\nRooney began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\n\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\n\nArgyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Just resign Wayne, you don't have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\"\n\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\"\n\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\"\n\nAnother fan agrees: \"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\"\n\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.",

        "article_text": "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip includes an update on Alphonso Davies with the Bayern Munich ace continuing to be linked with a move to Old Trafford.\n\nManchester United have reportedly been handed a boost in their pursuit of Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies.\n\nSpeculation over Davies' future continues as he has entered the final months of his contract at the Allianz Arena. Despite receiving a new offer from Bayern, the defender will be free to enter negotiations with clubs in the new year, should he not sign a fresh deal.\n\nAccording to German outlet BILD, Bayern have already started working on a 'shortlist of replacements' as there is a possibility Davies will leave the club next summer. It's said his agent are 'dealing with other clubs' while United are reportedly yet to come to the negotiation table.\n\nThe report states the reason why United haven't yet approached Davies' entourage is because the club are 'waiting' to see what Ruben Amorim's plans are for January. It has been reported that the Portuguese tactician wants to work with the squad first before making a decision.\n\nHowever, there is a chance United 'could get really serious' about landing Davies, who has been on the club's radar for some time. The Canada international is also subject of interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe defender himself has already refused to entertain such speculation that is surrounding his future beyond the end of this season. \"As of now, my full focus is to stay healthy and to play the game with the club I'm with right now,\" Davies said last month.\n\n\"I'm not focused on what's going on in the future. I'm just focusing on staying healthy and helping my team win. My team make me feel valued. The whole Bayern community make me feel valued. I see that each and every day.\"",

There, he met Amorim’s other assistant, Adelio Candido, who has also relocated to Old Trafford.\n\nThe duo have tracked with Amorim through his subsequent time at SC Braga and Sporting CP. Fernandes is the same age as United captain Bruno Fernandes, having celebrated his 30th birthday earlier this month.\n\nThe midfielder is actually two months older than his new mentor, with six other squad members born before coach Fernandes. Candido is even younger at age 28, with nine senior players older. Jonny Evans was born a whole decade before him.\n\nBoth assistants took to the Old Trafford dugout for the first time on Thursday as Amorim made his home bow in the 3-2 Europa League win over Bodo/Glimt. Fernandes then took to Instagram to share his first image since being brought to United.\n\nPosting a photo of himself from the night, he simply wrote: “New reality: Theatre of Dreams.” Candido, yet to post his first image at United, has changed his bio to show he is now located in Manchester.\n\nAmorim has previously waxed lyrical about the quality that assistant Fernandes possesses, tipping him to become a successful manager himself in the future.\n\nSpeaking back in February 2022, Amorim said: \"My number two is Carlos Fernandes, he’s been my right-hand man right from day one. He’ll be a much better coach than me.\n\n“I often say if I become Bobby Robson, then he’ll be my Jose Mourinho! But there’s plenty of time, we’ve signed a 15-year [working] deal!”",

Ipswich were by far the better team.\n\n\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\n\n\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time.

        "article_text": "Manchester United are reportedly expressing an interest in signing a player who only recently left Manchester City. United could be set for a busy January transfer window based on some of the reports that have emerged over the last few weeks. The window opens on New Year's Day, which means the Reds have just over a month before they are able to make new additions to their squad for the second half of the season.\n\nRuben Amorim is United's new head coach and enjoyed his first win on Thursday night with a 3-2 victory over Body/Glimt in the Europa League. Less than 24 hours later, the Reds are being linked with a potential new signing ahead of the January window.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, United are monitoring Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap. The report claims that the Reds are one of several Premier League teams weighing up a move to sign Delap just a few months after he completed a switch to Portman Road.\n\nUnited will reportedly compete with Chelsea for the signing of Delap, who has scored six goals in the Premier League this season. The striker spent last season on loan at Hull City before leaving City to complete a permanent move to Ipswich.\n\nAs part of the agreement that saw Delap leave the Etihad Stadium to sign for Ipswich, City agreed a £20million fee for the striker. City also included a buyback clause as well as a 20 percent sell-on fee in the deal, which could see them either benefit from Delap's future move or stop other clubs from signing their former star.\n\nDelap is not the only striker to be linked with a move to United ahead of the January transfer window. Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Brighton's Evan Ferguson have also been mentioned as potential targets in recent months.",

        "article_text": "Jadon Sancho has just left Ruben Amorim another Man United warning as Chelsea star shines again - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United news as Jadon Sancho has made a fine start to life at Chelsea - and he's given Ruben Amorim another big warning sign after his impressive display in the UEFA Conference League.\n\nJadon Sancho's performance at Chelsea has been significantly better than his time at Manchester United. It is still early days, but the facts bear it out.\n\nIt took him 65 games to reach five assists in all competitions at United, while he achieved the same feat in just seven games at Chelsea. Despite playing both Europa League and Champions League football with United, his Premier League record was less impressive as well, never exceeding three assists in a single league campaign.\n\nAt Chelsea, he has already matched that number in six Premier League matches. While some may argue that Sancho's recent assists were against weaker opposition, his lack of delivery in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup for United is notable. The statistics paint a clear picture: Sancho is performing better at Chelsea than he ever did at United.\n\nEven in his last Premier League start for the Blues - a relatively quiet game for the 24-year-old away to Liverpool in October - he could easily have won a penalty. That Enzo Maresca had the option to bring on a more suited paceman out wide in Pedro Neto is no slight on Sancho.\n\nThere are games he is a natural selection for and ones where he is not. Against a low-block at Bournemouth, he was the spark Chelsea needed, helped by an attacking full-back and midfield support.\n\nWhen Marc Cucurella was not stationed as high up two weeks later against Nottingham Forest, it was more of a struggle. At Anfield, he had Malo Gusto out-of-position behind him, something that certainly didn't make for a conducive and smooth approach on that side.\n\nThis is a blessing not a curse for Chelsea and has helped them get a good balance from Sancho rather than piling the load onto him, as was the case at United. Instead of all the attention being on a £72million addition - the final piece of the puzzle, as he was heralded widely - there is more a sense of Chelsea having another good squad option, utilising him in a different way.\n\nThe same was largely true of his time at Borussia Dortmund, where he spent more time back on his favoured left wing rather than the right, a position United wrongly identified as being his best. At Heidenheim, in a first start for over a month due to illness and rotation, it didn't make a difference.\n\nSancho was a constant source of energy for Chelsea, working in tandem with Christopher Nkunku and operating behind Marc Guiu as a striker. The duo displayed impressive chemistry, outmanoeuvring Heidenheim with their dribbling skills and looking superior to the rest of the players on the pitch.\n\nIt came as no surprise when Chelsea's first goal resulted from their collaboration on the right flank, with Sancho bypassing his full-back and delivering a precise cutback. He also assisted Mykhailo Mudryk in scoring the game-clinching goal later in the game, once again demonstrating his ability to create problems for the opposition by driving down the line and threatening to cut inside before finding another teammate on the edge of the box.\n\nAxel Disasi, nominally a centre-back, didn't contribute much creatively or provide much support in the Heidenheim half, leaving much of the responsibility to Sancho. Despite the absence of Cesare Casadei to provide additional options on the ball, Sancho still managed to stand out for Chelsea.\n\nThis is perhaps expected given that Chelsea is the most successful and wealthiest club to have ever participated in this competition, but it was nonetheless a positive sign for Sancho. He could easily have let this opportunity to make a case for inclusion in the first team pass him by.\n\nPedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez have demonstrated that there is real competition within the squad in certain areas if players are willing to seize the opportunity. Sancho may not be given the chance to start against Aston Villa on Sunday to capitalise on his impressive return, particularly as Unai Emery's side leaves space that Neto is more likely to exploit.\n\nHowever, this does not diminish his effectiveness or negatively affect his newfound vigour at Chelsea. By integrating him more fluidly into a larger group of players, Chelsea seem to be discovering a new way to maximise Sancho's potential - something United never achieved.\n\nFor Ruben Amorim, who is extremely unlikely to work with Sancho at United, the message should be clear. As well as getting a stronger set of performances out of the current squad, he will need to create an environment that allows for new signings to prosper.\n\nUnited did not do that with Sancho (and a host of others) under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag, and Jose Mourinho going back even further. Sancho is one of the statement examples of the widespread recruitment wastefulness. Chelsea are the team to exploit it now.",

        "article_text": "Why 'Netflix of Football' is a step closer after Premier League clubs make significant decision - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nPremier League clubs have decided to end a 20-year partnership with IMG and instead to bring all production and distribution of media content for international markets in house from 2026\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Premier League streaming service, referred to as the 'Netflix of Football' or 'Premflix', which could enhance club revenues and reduce expenses for supporters, has edged closer to reality.\n\nMany might think the most monumental decision from last Friday's Premier League shareholder meeting was regarding amendments to rules on associated party transactions in another episode of the ongoing regulatory tussle with Manchester City.\n\nYet, an arguably more consequential resolution was presented to the league's 20 clubs and garnered less attention but may herald a significant shift in how fans globally engage with the most-watched football league.\n\nThis critical vote sealed the end of a two-decade partnership with IMG, who currently produce 6,000 hours of content every season. This includes live broadcasting of all 380 matches and various magazine programs, delivered to 55 international broadcasters across 189 markets outside of Britain.\n\nIn a pivotal step, the Premier League clubs have unanimously agreed to take charge of producing and distributing their media content for global audiences from 2026 onwards.\n\nBy consolidating control over production, this could set the stage for the Premier League to introduce its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, an initiative previously touted as a \"Netflix of Football\" or \"Premflix\".\n\nThe NFL and NBA have already launched their own versions of this - NFL Game Pass and NBA League Pass. Europe often follows the lead of the more commercially mature US sports market.\n\nPaolo Pescatore of PP Foresight commented: \"In the first instance it feels like taking back ownership and control under one umbrella. This then in turn opens up new opportunities of distributing that content in different ways to existing and new viewers around the world.\n\n\"The direction of travel is clear as the adoption of connected devices continues to grow; we are all now streaming some form of television at any time and anywhere thanks to the internet via fibre or mobile networks.\"\n\n### Premflix 'a nice tool but not TV substitute'\n\nA direct-to-consumer platform would offer numerous benefits to the Premier League. Not only would it increase reach, being available to anyone with a device, but it could also gather customer data and potentially multiply revenue.\n\nA 2020 academic paper suggested that if the roughly 200 million people who currently subscribe to pay TV channels to watch the Premier League paid £10 a month for a dedicated streaming service, annual media rights income could skyrocket from £3.5bn to £24bn.\n\nWhile this may be an idealised scenario and does not factor in the costs of creating the content, the platform on which to show it, and marketing costs it does highlight the potential financial rewards of the right product.\n\nFrancois Godard from Enders Analysis remarked on the Premier Leagues move to handle their international media rights, saying it \"may be a clever move\". However, he emphasized the necessity of broadcasters: \"I don't see D2C [direct to consumer] as the future of football. Maybe it's an option you can use in certain markets,\" to negotiate better deals from media firms.\n\nFurther delving into American sports trends, Godard observed that long-term partnerships are formed between US leagues and broadcasters. He elaborated, saying: \"I don't believe the NFL and NBA D2C platforms are a substitute for sales to broadcasters,\" highlighting their usefulness as: \"They are a nice tool and a way to reach core fans.\"",

        "article_text": "The staggering £86m Manchester United sum that INEOS wants to avoid - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have spent huge sums in disposing of managerial, coaching staff, and club executive contracts\n\nThe era of excess at Manchester United appears to be over, with minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS having wasted little time over the last 11 months in ringing the changes at Old Trafford behind the scenes.\n\nSome 250 staff were made redundant earlier in the year, while certain ‘perks’ that had existed for club official were removed, including the use of the club credit card. Ratcliffe, handed football and strategy oversight following the acquisition of 27.7% of the football club from the Glazer family, was doubling down on his intention to stop the haemorrhaging of cash while the team continued to fail competitively.\n\nHis willingness to keep faith in Erik ten Hag for so long, agreeing to an extension at the end of last season despite many question marks over the Dutchman’s suitability for the top job at United, was, perhaps, a sign of Ratcliffe wanting to avoid the ‘hire em, fire em’ culture that had maybe been previously seen. In the end it was unavoidable and the publishing of the club’s first-quarter financial results earlier this week showed the financial strain.\n\nThe dismissal of ten Hag, along with the exits of his coaching staff, cost the club £11.4m, while the compensation required to bring his replacement, Ruben Amorim, to Old Trafford from Sporting CP came in at around £10m.\n\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire crunched some of the numbers over the past 10 years at United, highlighting that in sacking managers, coaching staff and parting ways with club officials such as Richard Arnold, the club had burned through £86.2m on those exercises alone, and that figure did not include the compensation paid to Newcastle United to acquire the services of sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nAfter Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 there was a cost of some £2.4m in redundancies related to his departure, while his successor, David Moyes, was sacked a day after the club failed to make the UEFA Champions League the following season, meaning he was only entitled to one-year redundancy, which still came in at £4.9m.\n\nLouis van Gaal was the next incumbent, and when he departed in 2016 he was paid £8.4m, while the man who replaced him, Jose Mourinho, was handed a £19.6m sum when he left in 2019.\n\nThe exits of Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and former vice-chairman Ed Woodward all added another £23.8m to the running total, while Arnold and other club executives left earlier this year to see the club burn through another £5.7m.\n\nThe decision to extend ten Hag’s deal turned out to be financial folly, although the desire to allow himself time to turn things around pointed to a reluctance to waste more money on the disposal of managerial contracts.\n\nThe hope for INEOS is that Amorim is the man to be able to return the club to the summit of European football once more, but he faces having to it while likely having to adopt a more frugal approach in the transfer market.",

He did that very well, he has those characteristics.\n\nThe Dane scored twice to give Manchester United three points against Bodo/Glimt (Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\n\"He was aggressive in the box, he is a quality player. I think he scores the more difficult goals. He has a lot to improve, it's the same for every player, but he did a great job today.\"\n\nDuring his debut season, Hojlund faced pointed criticism from Keane, who openly doubted the young striker's eagerness to find the net. Prior to breaking his 14-game scoreless streak with a goal in United's 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur last season, Keane did not mince words when discussing the Dane's campaign thus far.\n\nBefore the match, Keane said: \"He's been allowed some time now to bed himself into the club, into English football, but now we're talking about Man United. You have to have that real desire to score goals. They went to Wigan in midweek and won 2-0 with a defender scoring, and the second goal was a penalty.\n\nRoy Keane has been scathing in his criticism towards Rasmus Hojlund (Image: Photo by James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)\n\n\"These players just don't have the desire to score, and he's not shown it. There have been players that have come to Manchester United and we've spoken about how 'unlucky' they are, but you can't keep waiting.\"\n\nThe lack of goals from Hojlund in the first half of last season, along with his relative lack of experience, led Keane to question his finishing ability and suggest on Sky Sports that the player would be better suited as a rotational squad member rather than the main striker for United.\n\nKeane firmly stated: \"He shouldn't be starting, he should be in the back coming on for the odd cup game or something. What he needs is a world-class striker in front of him, learn from them, he's come to the club coming off the back of an injury and they've thrown him straight into a side that's low on confidence and belief.\"\n\nAlthough he's netted three goals and provided one assist in three European starts, he's had a tough time in the Premier League since coming back from injury, managing to score just one goal in eight matches.",

His last game was a home defeat against his predecessor, Enzo Maresca, now in charge of the high-flying Chelsea.\n\nLeicester were interested in Graham Potter and Carlos Corberán before installing Cooper in the summer but this week the club held productive talks with Van Nistelrooy. The club were reluctant to pay compensation for a manager, making him an attractive option.\n\nVan Nistelrooy previously had a short spell managing PSV Eindhoven, the club where he made his big breakthrough as a player, winning the Dutch Cup in 2023 before resigning, citing a lack of support within the club.\n\nLeicester are 16th in the table, one point above the relegation zone. The Dutchman’s first game could be at Brentford on Saturday, before matches against West Ham, Brighton, Newcastle and Wolves.\n\nLeicester’s players returned to training on Tuesday, led by the first-team coach Ben Dawson, who joined from Newcastle in the summer, after a Christmas party in Copenhagen.\n\nVan Nistelrooy joined United as an assistant coach in July but was appointed interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag and oversaw four games, winning three, drawing one.\n\nTwo of Van Nistelrooy’s wins in the United dugout came against Leicester, with a 5-2 win in the Carabao Cup before a 3-0 league victory in his final match in caretaker charge.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United raise member ticket prices to £66 and remove concessions\n==========================================================================\n\n*   Seats had started at £40 for adults and £25 for children\n*   Supporters’ trust fears big price rise next season\n\nManchester United have raised the cost of tickets for members to £66 and removed concession prices for the rest of this season. The decision has been greeted with dismay by the supporters’ trust, which fears this is the first step before “a significant price rise” next season.\n\nThe move comes as part of the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s efforts to make United more financially sustainable in the face of losses. Those tickets previously started at £40 for adults and £25 for children. Of the seats available to members across the rest of the season, 97% have been sold and the money raised by the increase is expected to be in the low millions of pounds.\n\nIn the long term Ratcliffe believes more prudent investment in the football operation is the prime way to make United more financially sound. Their debt totals £714m, comprising non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter rose from £36.5m in June’s end-of-year accounts because of United’s revolving credit facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nA Manchester United Supporters Trust statement in response to the ticket price changes said: “The club has provided zero consultation on the matter, neither with the forum nor the Fan Advisory Board nor MUST. We were simply informed of the decision that there will be price rises affecting certain fans that are ‘urgently needed’ to address profitability and sustainability concerns.\n\n“There is a risk that this is only the opening salvo of what will surely be massive pressure to implement a significant price rise for next season. Once they have got used to charging £132 for a parent and child to come to Old Trafford, will they really go back to the old pricing levels for next season?”\n\nUnited and Everton fans will stage a protest against ticket prices before their Premier League clash on Sunday. Supporters are being asked to gather next to the trinity statue outside Old Trafford to support the Football Supporters’ Association’s Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. As well as increasing prices generally, fans are unhappy about the removal of concession tickets for certain groups.",

The Norwegian side had won 6-1 at home.

They were labouring in Norway’s second tier and – as their sporting director, Håvard Sakariassen, puts it – had “hit the wall”. Those long trips from inside the Arctic Circle feel even more onerous when you are doing everything yourself and, as they prepare to visit [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), they would be forgiven a moment to marvel at how the picture has transformed.\n\n“We didn’t have a kit manager so we washed our kit at home and came to training already dressed,” says Sakariassen, who had recently quit as a player and found himself taking de facto responsibility for managing the team’s equipment. “To compare that to our resources today, it is a totally different world.”\n\nIt says everything that, when Bodø/Glimt walk out at Old Trafford, they will neither look nor feel out of place. This is their fifth successive season of European football and they have racked up the scalps. A Roma team managed by José Mourinho were famously [thrashed 6-1](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/21/europa-conference-league-roma-bodo-glimt-roundup) at their Aspmyra Stadion in the 2021-22 Conference League. [Celtic](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/bodo-glimt-celtic-europa-conference-league-play-off-second-leg-match-report) and, in the Europa League this season, [Porto are among](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/25/european-football-porto-lose-to-bodglimt-as-lazio-beat-dynamo-kyiv) a string of other victims. [Arsenal were run mightily close](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/13/bodo-glimt-arsenal-europa-league-match-report) when they visited two years ago. Whereas once there was novelty value in seeing a club from northern Europe’s furthest reaches, and a home town of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, bloodying big-name noses, they now feel like a staple.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey,” says Ulrik Saltnes, a long-serving midfielder who has made 370 appearances since joining in those days when a return to the top flight seemed some way off. “It’s almost hard to imagine really. Everything was so much smaller. There were so fewer people and the level was completely different. From being a team bouncing up and down the leagues to being a stable team in Europe every season since 2020, it’s just not comparable at all.”\n\nThat stability has coincided with the tenure of Kjetil Knutsen, a 56-year-old manager who has been linked with Premier League jobs but remains at the helm of Norway’s dominant force. [Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/bodoglimt) had never won an Eliteserien title until four years ago, when they streaked away at the top by 19 points. They have claimed two more and, as long as they beat Lillestrøm in a grandstand finale to the domestic campaign on Sunday, will add another.\n\nIt has been a triumph of club‑building: a success story unalloyed by wealthy backers or reckless gambles. Bodø/Glimt picked a proactive, progressive style of football and stuck with it, recruiting imaginatively while sticking firmly to their local roots. Bayern Leverkusen’s Nigeria striker Victor Boniface cut his teeth there but the overwhelming majority of Knutsen’s squad is Norwegian. They have been able to reinvest several hefty transfer fees but, as Sakariassen says: “We don’t see ourselves as a selling club.”\n\n![Image 4: Jens Hauge celebrates scoring Bodø/Glimt’s third goal against Porto in September](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4794853632d3b390a1b6733ec662bbeae4d9cf83/0_16_4947_2968/master/4947.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nJens Hauge celebrates scoring Bodø/Glimt’s third goal against Porto in September’s 3-2 win. Photograph: NTB/Reuters\n\nInstead they are driven by process. “We don’t have any goals in the club,” Sakariassen says. “We don’t, before the season, say: ‘Our aim is to become No 1 or 2.’ Or: ‘We’re going to win 80% of the home games.’ We threw that in the bin six years ago. We just work on trying to get better every day, doing the smart things, just working hard and only having one focus: to get the product to get better.”\n\nThey have succeeded in that. Outwardly bigger clubs in Scandinavia readily accept Bodø/Glimt have become a model for how clubs in the region might thrive. A region whose clubs’ influence on the continental stage has faded is represented by a standard bearer few could have expected. It would be a welcome bonus for Sakariassen and his cohort if they could help raise the levels of all around them. “I think you will see Norwegian teams doing well in future,” he says. “We push each other.”\n\nSaltnes points out that domestic opponents have found ways to tackle Bodø/Glimt that European rivals are yet to grasp. The tightness of this year’s title race, Brann poised a point behind, suggests so. Last year Knutsen’s team finished nine points clear of the same opponents so perhaps they will not become the kind of wrecking ball that has dominated similarly sized championships while giving little to the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe focus, though, remains on themselves. Bodø/Glimt’s next local project will be to build a new stadium, although nothing beyond their means. The charmingly atmospheric Aspmyra will be replaced by a slightly bigger 10,000-capacity venue. It will surely host Champions League football at some stage. They should have made a remarkable debut in this season’s group phase but, having taken a two-goal lead against Red Star Belgrade in the playoffs, were consigned to a 3-2 aggregate defeat.\n\nSuch a close-run thing was a further indicator of their progress. Performing at Old Trafford will be, too, and there will be some personal significance for Sakariassen, who admits to being one of the many Norwegians who followed United as a youngster. The main source of pride, though, comes from putting his home town near the centre ofon the European map against all odds.\n\n“When I travel around Europe it’s weird for me, coming from Bodø and knowing the history that we are a small club, that everyone knows us. It’s amazing for us, and also to see the impact the club has in Bodø, in the north of Norway and also in Norway. It’s really extraordinary for me as a Bodø/Glimt boy.\n\n",

      "article_text": "New Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says he is happy to be the \"Smiling One\" - but is prepared to be ruthless when required.\n\nIt is more than 20 years since Amorim’s fellow Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho announced himself as \"the Special One\" to an unsuspecting Premier League audience.\n\nWhile Amorim might not be quite as charismatic as Mourinho he appears a bubbly character on first appearances.\n\nHowever, when the hard work starts at Ipswich in the league on Sunday, he knows the smiles may not last.\n\n\"I can be the Smiling One but when we have a job to do I will be a different person,\" he said.\n\n\"There are some places to have fun but I can be ruthless when I have to be.\n\n\"[I can] be the nicest guy you will ever see, but if there is someone just thinking about himself, I will be a different person.\"\n\nAmorim is still getting used to his players, although he has already expressed his \"love\" for England midfielder Mason Mount because of his attitude.\n\nAt 39, Amorim is the youngest United boss since Wilf McGuiness followed Sir Matt Busby in 1969.\n\nThe achievements of Busby and fellow Scot Sir Alex Ferguson are the basis on which the club's illustrious history is largely based.\n\nAmorim was not even two years old when Ferguson moved south to United from Aberdeen in November 1986 - and said the pair are yet to meet.\n\nHowever, United in 2024 are a world away from the one Ferguson left in 2013, let alone joined. And the former Sporting boss accepts he has to do the job his way.\n\n\"I have to be me,\" he said. \"I'm always paying attention to details, trying to focus the players on the history of the club, not just the recent history. This is a club that has to win things.\n\n\"But it's a different time. I cannot be the same guy that Alex Ferguson was - it's a different time and I need to have a different approach. But I can also be demanding.\"",

      "headline": "14:21 22 November'Dreamer' Amorim 'right guy' to revive Man Utd",
      "article_text": "New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he is the \"right man\" for the club but will need time to implement his ideas.\n\nThe 39-year-old signed a two-and-a-half-year deal earlier this month to replace Erik ten Hag, who was sacked in October.\n\nUnited are 13th in the Premier League table, seven points above Sunday's opponents Ipswich Town, who are fourth from bottom.\n\nWhile Amorim recognises the size of the task facing him at Old Trafford, he believes he can turn the club's fortunes around.\n\n\"I'm a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself and I believe in the club,\" he said during his first news conference as head coach.\n\n\"I think we have the same idea, the same mindset and that can help.\n\n\"I truly believe in the players, I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things. You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\n\n\"Call me naive, but I believe I am the right guy at the right time. I truly believe I am the right guy.\"\n\nThe Portuguese, who has joined United after four years at Sporting, insisted he will bring change in order for the club to challenge for the Premier League title again.\n\nHe added: \"I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it's a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try to win the title.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take.\"\n\nGiven his nationality and success in Portugal, Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho, who had spells in the Premier League with United, Chelsea and Tottenham. The Fenerbahce coach spent two-and-a-half-years at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League following his appointment in 2016.\n\nAmorim, though, was keen to play down the comparisons.\n\n\"I'm different from Mourinho, I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto.\n\n\"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere. It's not the same thing. He was European champion, I am not.\n\n\"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\"\n\nAmorim 'accomplished and assured' - Dan Roan, Sports editor\n\nYes, he will ultimately be judged by results on the pitch, but this was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nIn recognition of the limited time the coach has had in his new surroundings, United had chosen to stage a normal pre-match media briefing in the rather plain Jimmy Murphy building at the training ground, rather than a more formal Old Trafford unveiling of the kind previous new managers such as Erik ten Hag had held.\n\nBut this felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, the more charismatic Amorim seemed undaunted by the attention and appeared to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he was \"the right guy at the right time\", while gently accusing the media of a lack of faith.\n\nBut he also acknowledged the scale of the task he faces here after years of decline, accepting that \"we have to improve\" and \"I don’t know how long it will take\" when I asked him how long he felt he needed to repair the club.\n\nHe will also be aware that with United having spent more than half a billion pounds on new players under Ten Hag, and with Profit and Sustainability rules to comply with, he will have to largely work with the players he has got.\n\nAmorim is currently living in the same city centre hotel that Jose Mourinho used as his base during his reign at United, but is said to be close to moving into a house, and is clearly wary of being compared too closely to his compatriot.\n\nHowever, he also firmly rejected the suggestion this was 'the impossible job'. \"Of course not,\" he said.\n\nAmorim is the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford – so a lot is resting on him. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty - a senior director at the petrochemicals company - and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it.\n\nHaving spoken for more than thirty minutes, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen.\n\nBut based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.",

      "headline": "09:33 22 NovemberPremier League clubs approve changes to APT rules",
      "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City.\n\nToday's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nAfter all, the changes the league was proposing - after a tribunal panel found elements of the APTs were unlawful - will weaken the rules. Clearly 16 clubs were loathe to loosen them even more.\n\nThe Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future.\n\nHowever, today's vote - while an emphatic defeat for City in the end - also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiraling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote. Last week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules. They feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nIn October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated. Manchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.\n\nAfter the tribunal, City claimed the rules were \"void\" and criticised the Premier League's \"misleading\" suggestion they could be swiftly amended. The club threatened further legal action if there was a \"knee-jerk reaction\".\n\nBut following meetings of its Legal Advisory Group and Financial Controls Advisory Group, the Premier League proposed several amendments before today's vote in London. City argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League.",

      "headline": "12:59 21 NovemberGo big or go home on Arsenal's defence - FPL tips & team of week",
      "article_text": "**We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.**\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\n_The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit._\n\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n----------------------\n\n**David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m**\n\n**Gabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m**\n\n**William Saliba, Arsenal, £6m**\n\n**All home to Nottingham Forest**\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\n**Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n--------\n\n**Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton**\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with _just_ an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\n**Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich**\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\n**Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford**\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\n**Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves**\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nForwards\n--------\n\n**Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\n**Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\n**Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth**\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is _the_ cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n-----------\n\n**Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves**\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\n**Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton**\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\n**Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\n**Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton**\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\n**Total team cost = £98.5m**\n\nTeam to target\n--------------\n\n**Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)**\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.\n\nFantasy 606 corner...\n---------------------\n\nWe were discussing a Gameweek 12 wildcard on the podcast this week despite the fact that Chris Sutton, Statman Dave and I don’t have one to play.\n\nChris advised to go for Mo Salah over Erling Haaland even though his rule this season is to have neither in his squad.\n\nDave reckons you should flip-flop between the pair of them depending on the fixture list starting with Salah in your team for the next three gameweeks.\n\nI think that wastes too many transfers and too much money so I think you pick one and stick with him - I’m leaning towards Salah for the long-term but I do like the look of the Tottenham fixture for Haaland this week.\n\nDave says ditch David Raya and do away with the double Arsenal defence but I’m actually going to stick with that.\n\nWe were agreed that Cole Palmer should be the first name on the wildcard teamsheet but Dave reckons Wolves striker Matheus Cunha is not too far behind in terms of what he could deliver in the coming weeks.\n\nWhatever you do it’s a very good idea to consider who you’re going to captain each week all the way through to Gameweek 19, at least, to help you with your planning.\n\nOur listeners’ manager has decided to sell James Maddison to bring in Bruno Fernandes this week - he couldn’t quite afford Palmer - and the captain’s armband is going to Haaland.",

I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n\n\"You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\"\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.\n\nAsked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing.\n\n\"I don’t know about repair.\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play.\n\n\"We have to change the physical aspect of the team.

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim made a favourable impression on his press conference debut at Carrington that will fuel belief among Man United supporters.\n\nRuben Amorim was a tad late. Those of us earwigging in the front row could make out one final briefing from a press officer as they stood outside in front of the Jimmy Murphy Plaque.\n\nManchester United's chief communications officer, Toby Craig, and Tom Crotty, the Ineos communications director, entered the room seconds before Amorim. His confident Q&A suggests he does not require any PR management.\n\nWhen he eventually strode in, it was déjà vu. Handsome, hirsute, a stylish stubble and clad in the same tracksuit, there were shades of Ruud van Nistelrooy's entrance for his maiden press conference in the same room three weeks earlier.\n\nThe audience was considerably larger for Amorim. A quick head-count suggested 34 journalists. \"Hi guys,\" Amorim said as he breezed in.\n\nThere was no choreographed handshake for regulars on the front row, as there was from Erik ten Hag two and a half years ago. Amorim clasped hands with some of the nine Portuguese journalists at the end of his 30-minute introduction.\n\nHe is a coach who needs no introduction. We have seen plenty of him in recent weeks through press conferences in Lisbon and his tour of Old Trafford. Dozens of newspaper pages have been dedicated to him and journalists were dispatched to Lisbon to discover more about United's youngest manager (or head coach) since 1969.\n\nA Portuguese contact assured me on Thursday Amorim would answer every question and he did. At length. For us transcribers, he is a nightmare. His command of English is so impeccable and he is such a vibrant personality he talks so quickly it is impossible to keep up.\n\nLike the last Portuguese manager to hold court at Carrington, Amorim is quotable. \"We have to be better running back. I think that is clear for everybody!\" He said it with a smile, his body language defusing the asperity of his delivery.\n\nAmorim smiles a lot. That warmth will serve him well. Ten Hag was a gruff disciplinarian and the right man at the right time to restore authority to the United manager's role. But his lack of charisma - on camera - meant there was nothing to fall back on when things went south.\n\nIneos have demanded Amorim be billed as head coach but man-management is just as important as the coaching. With his Latino tan, full-beam smile and trimmed beard you could light a match with, he will be an empathetic sounding board for the players.\n\nHe is one of the few who believes in them. \"I know you guys don’t believe a lot in these players! But I believe a lot. We have room to improve, I want to try new things, you guys think it’s not possible, I think it’s possible. We will see in the end.\n\n\"You have to believe and I believe in them, because when I start this week, you can say it’s one week, three trainings, you change the coach, of course everybody is excited, but they are open to different things. It’s the only thing I ask: hard work and you have to believe in the new idea. And I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players.\"\n\nThere was a mischievous glint with the reference to \"you guys\". The Portuguese contact added that Amorim tends to joke. He did with only his second answer.\n\nHe is completely at ease in front of the cameras. The majority of the post-Ferguson managers have not been. Amorim is more Van Gaal or Mourinho than Moyes or Solskjaer or Ten Hag. The latter three were at their best away from the cameras in San Carlo on King Street, the opulent surroundings of a Perth hotel or over tapas in Cadiz.\n\nAmorim spoke warmly about his rapport with Mourinho and fondly recalled his week at Carrington in April 2018. But \"I'm a different guy,\" he stressed. Yet just as headstrong.\n\nThe topic of recruitment confirmed that. \"I have to have a strong position on that because I am the coach, I know how to play, so I think it’s all together but the final word should be the manager.\" Viktor Gyokeres was mentioned during the Portuguese section.\n\n\"Viktor Gyökeres is a Sporting player, he’s got a game today and I hope he plays well, doesn’t get injured and is successful at Sporting.\" Scanning the transcript, Amorim reserved his most quotable lines when he was speaking English.\n\nThe minor lateness was more than forgivable.",

      "headline": "I spent a week with Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and this is what I learnt",
      "article_text": "When Ruben Amorim was shown around Carrington last week and given an insight into the £50m redevelopment that will transform Manchester United's training ground, he would have given the plans his seal of approval. Amorim was talking about the changes required at Carrington as far back as 2018.\n\nDuring his week-long internship at United under Jose Mourinho, while studying for a master's in high-performance football coaching at the University of Lisbon, Amorim and his fellow students discussed the layout of the training ground with Mourinho and his staff.\n\nIt has been accepted for a while that Carrington needed major redevelopment work to keep pace with the quality of new training grounds built around the Premier League. The subject was high on the agenda again when Cristiano Ronaldo criticised the facilities on his acrimonious departure in 2022.\n\nIneos is now attempting to bring the training ground back up to standards with a major redevelopment, which has led to the first team being relocated to a different building for this season. Despite the inconvenience, Amorim would no doubt have approved of the plans.\n\n\"We talked a lot about the functionality of the building and how they want to improve it,\" said Geoff Labine, one of two other students who spent the week at United with Amorim.\n\n\"The layout of Carrington wasn’t seamless, and you were going back and forth to prepare for the training session. They wanted it more seamless, so you just enter and go from one section to the next. We spoke with the coaches about that a lot.\" \n\nThat anecdote shows just how long the layout and set-up at Carrington has been a talking point for staff at United. That it is being rectified now suggests Amorim has chosen a good time to move from student to head coach at United, with Ineos stamping their authority on the club.\n\nAmorim was one of three students from the 2017/18 intake of the master's course to be selected for the internship under Mourinho, who was working at United at the time. He was joined in Manchester by Labine and Mohammed Bubshait, as well as Professor Antonio Veloso, who was leading the course.\n\nThey attended every training session during a week in late April as United prepared for a Premier League game against Arsenal, which they would win 2-1. Amorim, Labine, and Bubshait would report to Carrington at 8:30 every morning and spend some time milling around in the canteen before Mourinho came to see them.\n\nThey would then watch training, chat with Mourinho and his assistant Rui Faria and offer their own observations to each other before spending time talking over lunch back in the Carrington canteen.\n\n\"Jose and Rui would take turns working with the team so he would periodically come over with us. We were in the dugouts when it's raining, or just on the side of the training field while the session was going on,\" Labine told the Manchester Evening News from his native Canada this week.\n\n\"You could see he was talking to Ruben a little bit more than us. Antonio [Veloso] mentioned that they had already earmarked Ruben as one of the next good Portuguese coaches.\n\n\"So Mourinho was aware of that and was moulding him. He would with us about certain things, but also had some private conversations with Ruben. We would watch Mourinho do a couple of media sessions. Then we would debrief after lunch and maybe chat with Jose and his staff for a little bit.\"\n\nIn the evenings, the students generally did coursework, although one evening, Mourinho invited them out to watch Champions League football together.\n\n\"We chatted about the course, and he would just talk about players that we were watching on TV, he would chuckle about this guy being the laziest guy you’ve ever seen on TV. There were a lot of great stories,\" said Labine.\n\n\"It was neat being around him. There was definitely an aura. Even at Carrington, I just felt like people would kind of straighten up a bit when he walked in the room. You could feel the energy.\n\n\"He is a larger-than-life personality, so I think that's maybe where they differ between Ruben and Jose. I think Ruben is much more diplomatic and approachable, not as authoritarian or blunt and straight to the point.\n\nLabine recalls the new United head coach noticing that the players weren't doing much post-training rehab or cooling down, they weren't using ice baths that often and didn't hang around long after training had finished. They were in the cars and heading away from Carrington.\n\nHe also told his fellow students that Mourinho was more rigid with his structure and that he would play a more flexible game.\n\n\"I think he had an idea for a system, he was already getting ready to do his coaching credentials, and I think he was already about to go and coach at Braga,\" said Labine.\n\n\"People would bring up good ideas and good points, and he would listen to all of them, but I think he had a clear identity of what he wanted to do and what he wanted to try. He would have a couple of things that he would seem flexible on, but then, in the end, I think he preferred it this way.\n\n\"He's pretty intense. He expects you to have a good understanding of the situational play. So when Ruben was running some sessions, if a couple of the coaches didn't pick him up by the cue, he would kind of look over like, ‘Oh, you guys don't understand the triggers for when this happens’, stuff that I guess that they're learning in Portugal at a younger age when we had coaches from all over the world, so I don't think we have the tactical intelligence at the level of Ruben.\"\n\nLabine remembers Amorim as an unassuming person, someone who didn't demand his attention for his playing exploits. When they started together, Labine had no idea who he was until another student showed him clips of Amorim playing for Benfica and Portugal.\n\n\"He's a really nice guy, very humble. He was very organised, punctual, very professional. He was very measured,\" he said. \"When he would give his answers, he would not take a long time, but he would take a second to think about it and give a very measured answer.\n\n\"Politically he knew what to say and how much to say but not to say too much. When we did media training sessions, he was obviously very comfortable answering questions and not giving out too much information, but just being mindful of what to say and what not to say.\"\n\nAmorim was in a WhatsApp chat with his fellow alumni from the university course, but when he got the Sporting job in 2020, he wrote a message to tell them he would have to leave the group.\n\nLabine, now a coach at a football academy at a school in Canada, still remembers those days with Amorim and cherishes the pictures taken when the group left Carrington.\n\n\"Me and a couple of the other coaches still touch base once in a while and we reminisce,\" he said. \"The students and the players that I have, they get a chuckle out of the picture that I have with the guys and Jose.\n\n\"It's just kind of been neat to see how Ruben's progressed to be the next Jose. So I have a picture with both Portugal's old and new. So it's neat to watch him. Everyone knew he was going to be successful.",

      "headline": "'He gave me a headache' - Premier League rivals will fear exciting Ruben Amorim at Manchester United",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has begun work at Man Utd and the MEN have been told why he's such an exciting appointment. Manchester United released images of Ruben Amorim's first training session at Carrington earlier this week. The players were smiling and looked to be in tremendous spirits, but David Rosa remembers his first few sessions working with Amorim at Casa Pia slightly differently.\n\n\"I remember that he was the first coach I ever met who left me with a headache at the end of the first week of training, such was the amount of information I had to process,\" said Rosa.\n\nUnited believe they have appointed one of the world's finest coaches and Rosa regards Amorim as the best that he encountered during his career, even if he did give him a headache.\n\nAmorim will have to be every bit as good as his reputation. The 39-year-old has inherited a United side that struggles to score goals and currently sits 13th in the Premier League, but he took over at Sporting Lisbon in similar circumstances and led them to their first league title for 19 years.\n\nAmorim's rise in Portugal was remarkable and it started at Casa Pia, a small and modest club in Lisbon that is dwarfed by its inner-city neighbours Sporting and Benfica. Amorim had only just retired from playing and lived nearby, so he approached the then-third division side in 2018. Casa Pia play at a stadium with a capacity of just over 2,500 and were an amateur team. Amorim lost his first two games in charge and said he would quit if he suffered a third defeat. \n\nAmorim won that game, changed the team's formation and began a special journey. Rosa's arrival at Casa Pia coincided with Amorim's and he still has fond memories of that time. Rosa recently spoke to the Manchester Evening News about Amorim and said: \"Ruben always showed great openness and was very friendly from the start. And I think regardless of the club he coaches or the league he's in, his attitude has been the same since his first day as coach.\n\n\"The area where he has always stood out from other coaches is undoubtedly the relationships he creates with players and I would say those relationships are the key to his success. \n\n\"He's able to understand his players, know exactly what they're thinking and what they're feeling. He is able to have a group of 26 players in the squad where everyone is motivated and where he clearly shows the importance that each one has in the team. \n\nThen he showed not only a very strong knowledge of the game but an unshakeable belief in his idea of the game. Ruben has all the traits of what I think a leader should have. He knows exactly what he wants from each player and manages to convey that message in a very simple and clear way.\n\nThere is no greater challenge for a coach or leader than managing the expectations of his team. Often the expectations of each player are blurred by what the coach expects of that player. Ruben has incredible communication skills and manages the player's expectations by showing how important he is to the bigger picture and like I said, has a clear ideology of the game model he wants.\"\n\nErik ten Hag was criticised for failing to implement a clear identity during his time at Old Trafford and United often looked unorganised, something which Amorim should address. \"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\" said Rosa.\n\n\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen. It made it easier for us to make decisions. \n\n\"I often say, and I truly mean this, that if we sat down in a huddle at Casa Pia, with one player per table as if it were a test, with a blank sheet of paper, each of us would know exactly what to do. We would know what passing solutions or actions we would have when we received the ball, and we would even be able to talk about positions other than our own.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the fact that he was a player has helped him in his career so far. The fact that he was a player meant that he went through various situations, such as being a starter, being a substitute, or not being called up. So here he had the experience that every player has.\n\nAnd this has allowed him to know what each player is feeling. Then the midfielders are players who, because they are positioned in the centre, have to have a more comprehensive knowledge of team dynamics, so they know the positions to take and the movements inside out. \n\nWhen asked about Amorim's training sessions, Rosa responded: \"I used to say that his training sessions weren't his holy grail. When I say that, I mean the type of exercises he used.\n\nWhat set him apart was the way he applied the exercises. The same exercise given by different coaches will have different results. What some coaches saw as the goal of a particular exercise, he managed to change the paradigm and show that that exercise could have much more than just a goal. Then it has a lot to do with the intensity and demand he puts on the exercises.\n\nCasa Pia's players bought into Amorim's system. They appreciated his willingness to invest in them as people and Deritson Lopes described Amorim as \"the angel\" in his life in an interview in 2020, as United's new head coach went to extraordinary lengths to help him away from the pitch. \n\nHis now famous 3-4-3 system saw Casa Pia embark on an unbeaten run and he began to make national headlines in Portugal because he didn't have the required coaching badges.\n\nIn January 2019, Casa Pia were deducted six points and Amorim was suspended for one year for giving instructions during a match without having the required coaching level to do so. The ban was subsequently suspended but Amorim resigned. \"Here in Portugal, he had an issue with his coaching badges,\" Joao Nuno Fonseca told MEN. \"That was something that got our attention here in Portugal because when you're not eligible to be the head coach, you need to be registered as an assistant then someone with the UEFA Pro licence takes the lead. \n\nFonseca was the assistant manager of Benfica B during Amorim's rise in Portugal and kindly provided insight into his journey beyond Casa Pia. \"It picked up our attention from outside because he wasn’t legally eligible to do it, but the club had the power and trust to let him do it,\" he said. \n\n\"It was unique because they gave an opportunity to someone who didn’t have the diploma to receive it. He was regarded as exciting even at Casa Pia and the strength of his communication about the topics on the coaching badges made some impact in the news in Portugal. \n\nHis capability to justify, to get in depth about his tactical approach kept the attention of the presidents of the clubs and you see this on the social media nowadays with journalists, you see his capability to communicate well and to pass the message on clearly. This is huge. \n\nAmorim speaks outstanding English, he understands the nuances of the language and a club source has admitted that will be a hugely helpful skill. Ten Hag's communication wasn't a strength but everyone you speak to about Amorim praises his ability to communicate and empathise. \n\nIt didn't take long for Amorim to return to coaching after his departure from Casa Pia. He was appointed as manager of Braga's reserves in September 2019, winning seven of his eight games, and was asked to take charge of the first-team after they sacked their manager. Amorim's first game in charge of Braga came on January 4, 2020, and he became Sporting's manager just 60 days later. Sporting were in turmoil and took a punt on Amorim, despite him having just two months of experience managing in the Portuguese top-flight, but they spotted something.\n\nSporting paid a substantial €10million to hire Amorim, along with his assistants Carlos Fernandes and Adelio Candido, and the Portuguese media, fans, and coaches were gripped by the story. \"It caused not a shock but a surprise because Sporting, in the years before Ruben entered the club, were the kind of club that sacked a coach almost every six months,\" explained Fonseca. \n\n\"Coaches were the most vulnerable in the politics of the club and were sacked often, but they made an effort to bring him from Braga and that step created an impact on everyone because when you pay €10m for a head coach inside your own country, it represents something. I think that created the exciting part from the outside looking in at the situation. Everyone wanted to see what Ruben was capable of doing to make sure his market value was €10m.\"\n\nIt turned out Sporting got their money's worth. Amorim won the Liga Nos title in his first season in charge, leading Sporting to their first league triumph in almost two decades, he won the Portuguese League Cup twice, the Portuguese Super Cup, and another league title to boot. \n\nIn the summer, there was surprise in Portugal that Amorim wasn't lured away from Sporting but United came calling when Ten Hag was axed and he was ready for the opportunity. So what should United fans expect? \"He's very intense,\" Fonseca said. \"I think he's a coach that has his own ideas, of course on possession based, but he can also adapt his strategies.\n\nI think this season that's been one of the biggest points that made him so strong. He can read the game and change because he was a player before, so he feels the things inside the pitch and he can have an impact now he's on the bench. I think this is a very, very, very strong point.\n\nThat's what I took from being outside and look at his last game with Sporting. He was losing 2-0 until half-time, he switched and won 4-2 in the end. This is a very powerful capability. \n\nI think he’s also a manager that gives opportunities to young players, like he did at Sporting, and when you give that opportunity, you need to know them, of course, and need to follow their progress for the reserve team and check if they are capable to enter to the first-team level. \n\nThis kind of communication with the reserve team and teams below is crucial and again, it goes back to the main point that I’ve told you: his communication is a huge strength. \n\nThe capability to communicate ideas, the link of information that you can bring inside the club and in my opinion, when you are capable of giving opportunities to young players, you are playing a strong card because you give them the chance to show their creativity and skill.\"\n\nFonseca continued: \"When players are young they are like… street guys. They aren’t afraid to make a one-on-one against a top player, they just do it, and they do it because they can do it. It’s the capability to be direct with players. And of course, empathy because when you’re empathetic you create communication and a link with everyone. So in that sense, when you have that skill, you make a huge step to be successful, so I think he has all the ingredients to do well.\n\nHe can be one of the best managers for Manchester United but will need time. He needs trust from the players and fans because when you don’t have results sometimes it’s difficult. But like Arsenal did with Mikel Arteta, Manchester United need to do that with Amorim because you need time to do good work. You need patience to be successful and time to fail sometimes. With failure, you get stronger and with Ruben’s ideas, I think United will go to the top soon.\n\nThe Amorim era has begun in Manchester. You should strap yourself in for the ride.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim will take charge for the first time against Ipswich. (Image: Getty Images)\n\nBruno Fernandes has sent Ruben Amorim a clear message ahead of his first game in charge for Manchester United against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm).\n\nAmorim officially began his duties at Carrington earlier this week, following a short visa delay. He has already had a busy week, having conducted training sessions, plus club and media interviews.\n\nFans are excited to see the Portuguese head coach hit the ground running and guide United up the table. His team sit 12th after 11 games, but a victory at Portman Road would see them close the gap to just one point to the top-six, with plenty of points to play for.\n\nFernandes, meanwhile, joined his compatriot in Manchester this week after representing Portugal in the Nations League. Although he's never been coached by Amorim previously, the United captain has always spoke highly of him and has followed his work at his former club, Sporting Clube de Portugal.\n\nAhead of Sunday afternoon's clash, Fernandes conducted a short interview with DAZN Portugal and sent a subtle message to his new manager. \"I feel more free on the pitch. As long as I am on the pitch, I can play in any position.\n\n\"There's a message for Mister [Ruben Amorim]!\" Fernandes said. Having played in a number of positions in his four-year spell at the club, the Portugal international also highlighted how influential he can be on the pitch.\n\n\"I'm a person who adapts really well to playing in different positions,\" Fernandes, 30, went on. \"I think the positions where I play best is as an eight and in the [number] 10 role.\n\n\"I've played as a 6 as well as a winger before and even played as a striker because of the injuries at the start of the season - we didn't have anyone [in that position]. So I'm a person who adapts really well but obviously the position where I feel I fit best is in the middle of the pitch and where I can flourish more.\"",

Imagine comparing him to Sir Alex Ferguson who won the league with this starting XI. THE GOAT MANAGER!!\"\n\nAnother agreed, adding: \"Pep Guardiola is currently losing his 5th game in a row. Never ever compare this fraud to Sir Alex Ferguson.\"\n\nWhile one noted: \"Sir Alex Ferguson has never lost 4 games in a row, while someone is losing his 5th in a row. Never compare him to PEP or others. NEVER!\"\n\nThe shock result ends City's 52-game unbeaten run at the Etihad and marks their second defeat to the London club in just 25 days having lost 2-1 to Tottenham in the EFL cup in October.\n\nThe champions other losses in the five game slide came at the hands of Bournemouth, Sporting Lisbon and Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Guardiola said: \"In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation. Now we have to live it and break it by winning the next games, especially the next one. Of course the players are struggling. We are happy when we win and concerned when we don't win. It's normal.\"",

I think he did very well.\n\n“I am trying to convince Enzo in the way I played last year with Wilfred Ndidi and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, the attacking midfielder has to arrive inside the box.\n\n\"The reason he scored today was because he was in the box.\n\n\"Otherwise, from outside the box, you are not going to score goals.\n\n“So we are happy with the way Enzo is playing.”\n\nNext up for the west Londoners is a trip to German outfit Heidenheim in the Europa Conference League on November 28 before they return to Premier League action on December 1 against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge.",

It's a terrible tackle.\n\n\"If you look at it again here, as he comes in, bang. He's not even going for the ball with that leg, he's come in, and that's an old-fashioned, 'do him with the right leg'. Watch where the ball is and watch where Ndidi's right foot is. The ball's there, bang, 'I'm gunna do ya', and he tries to swipe the ball with his left foot.\"\n\nCole added: \"This is a game where Leicester were miles off it, at the height of their frustration. He lost his rag and he should be sent off. He nearly scores the equaliser. If he plays a part in getting them back into the game, I'd imagine Enzo Maresca will be furious.\" \n\nChelsea will be back in action on Thursday when they take on Heidenheim in the UEFA Conference League.",

      "article_text": "Jamie Vardy's unconventional pre-match diet has been revealed after the Leicester City star was seen enjoying a Red Bull before playing Chelsea.\n\nAfter a two week international break, the Premier League returned on Saturday with a gameweek with several exciting clashes including a top of the table clash between defending champions City and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLeicester City welcomed former manager Enzo Maresca back to to the King Power stadium as they faced Chelsea in the first match of the gameweek, with the visitors taking the lead in the first half through in-form Nicolas Jackson.\n\nBut ahead of the game, Leicester striker Vardy's bizarre pre-match diet has resurfaced after the Englishman was spotted drinking a can of Red Bull in the tunnel before the match.\n\nIn an in-depth interview with Sky Sports as part of their 'Making it Pro' feature, the former England man revealed he still opts for a crazy caffeine fix prior to games.\n\nSpeaking in 2020, he said: \"I wake up in the morning and then [have a] Red Bull. Literally I get out of bed, get the kids up and downstairs, get their breakfast sorted and then I'm straight into the Red Bull.\n\n\"After that we meet at the stadium for pre-match and while I'm getting changed I'll have a coffee - it's better than taking ProPlus. Red Bull, coffee and then when we get over to the pre-match lounge, I'll have my cheese and ham omelette with another can of Red Bull.\"\n\nAsked how his stomach is able to process and deal with the caffeine coming his way, Vardy replied: \"I think when you've done it for so many years I think it just gets used to it, it's not an issue whatsoever. It's one of them things, it's not going to work for everyone.\n\n\"To be fair, I've probably cut back because I'm only on a little can of Red Bull now whereas before when I was at Fleetwood I used to have the big cans of Monster - I used to have two of them as well.\"\n\nIn the past, Vardy's habits included mixing Skittles and vodka, while he also had a thing for drinking port out of a Lucozade bottle.\n\nWriting in his autobiography, Vardy said: \"I can't say why it started, because I genuinely don't know, but I decided to drink a glass of port on the eve of every game in the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"I'm not normally superstitious but from the moment I scored against Sunderland on the opening day, I didn't want to change anything.\"\n\n\"I fill a small plastic water or Lucozade bottle to halfway and just sip the port while watching television. It tastes like Ribena to me, and it helps me switch off and get to sleep a bit easier the night before a game.\"\n\nSpeaking in 2021, Vardy's former Leicester teammate, Ritchie De Laet, opened up about the time Vardy finished off a bottle of port before breaking a Premier League record.\n\n“The night before a game, Jamie drinks pints and only eats pizza,\" he told Belgian outlet Het Nieuwsblad.\n\n“For example, when he beat Ruud Van Nistelrooy’s record by scoring in 11 consecutive games; the night before, the bus driver bought us a bottle of port. We hid it in our hotel room.",

That's what I think is world-class.\n\n“If I was asking my kids who want to be forwards, I would be saying I would like them to look at what Vinicius Jr does as opposed to Mohamed Salah.\n\n\"But his goals that he [Salah] scores, he scores an unbelievable amount of goals, he's highly effective, but that’s just my opinion.”\n\nGiven the fact Salah has won every trophy available to him at Liverpool, fans were left baffled by the comments. \n\nDespite his contract being set to expire this summer, the Liverpool man has continued to score goals, having netted eight times in 11 Premier League appearances, helping the Reds to the top of the league going into game week 12.\n\nDeeney has now explained his outlandish comments in his column for The Sun.\n\n“The Liverpool player is a brilliant winger, his goalscoring numbers are incredible, and he has achieved some truly amazing things at the club,” wrote Deeney.\n\n“But world class? No.\n\n“Let me make this clear — this is not a personal attack on Salah. I think he is a top player and a great guy.\n\n“I played against him a lot in my career and can appreciate just how good he is.”\n\nHowever, Deeney did explain how it was not just Salah who he thought was not world-class. \n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe was also dubbed “currently NOT world-class”, according to the former Hornets man.\n\nBut he did concede that five players, including two of Salah’s Liverpool teammates, are world-class.\n\nDeeney named Virgil van Dijk, Alisson, Rodri, Erling Haaland and Vinicius Jr as his five world-class players currently plying their trade.",

I can feel the awkwardness, and I'm not sitting there.”\n\nA third explained: “Both are very different.”\n\nBut a fourth defended the former United boss, saying: “I still feel ten hag could be our Rodgers ..has laid a good foundation for Amorim.”\n\nWith a fifth explaining how Amorim’s master of the English language could possibly be the reason for coming across as more confident in his explanations, they said: “Ten Hag is just not very good in English, and his presence is unfortunately a little awkward, that makes a bad combo.”\n\nFor most of Ten Hag’s tenure, his United sides played on the 'back-foot', utilising counterattacks as a way of punishing the opposition rather than the ‘front-foot’ play United fans have been previously used to.\n\nAs for Amorim, his preferred style at his former club, Sporting, was to make use of a 3-4-3 formation with extra responsibility for the wing-backs.\n\nThe 39-year-old explained his theory on the team’s playing style during Friday’s press conference.\n\n\"As a coach, you have to choose one way or another,” he told the gathered media.\n\n“I always, 100%, our way.

      "article_text": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken out about the club's 115 financial fair play charges just one day after signing a two-year extension on his deal.\n\nAfter a two-week international break, the Premier League is back in action on Saturday with several exciting clashes including a match between defending champions City and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nJust days before the match, City fans were treated to the news that legendary manager Guardiola had signed a new deal with the club, extending his stay there until the summer of 2027.\n\nHaving signed the new deal, Guardiola has now spoken out again about City's 115 charges regarding breaches of the Premier League's FFP rules, and his comments are not going to sit well with rival fans.\n\nAt the start of the season, the Catalan manager claimed that he would stand by the club even if they were found guilty of the 115 charges and relegated to a lower tier of the English football ladder.\n\nAnd now, much to the dismay of rivals hoping he would leave City in the near future, he has doubled down on his promise.\n\nSpeaking ahead of City's clash with Tottenham this weekend, Guardiola said: \"I said six months ago, when all the clubs accused us of doing something wrong, [and was asked] what happened if we are relegated. I will be here.\n\n\"Next year, if we are in the Conference, we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now. I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, 'It's the last year of Pep'. I don't want to be in that position.\"\n\nHowever, the five-time Premier League winner admitted that if results for City turned for the worst, then he would consider leaving the club and pursuing a career elsewhere.\n\n\"I would like to stay for the two years but I know if the results are not good it will not be two years,\" added Guardiola.\n\nSo far in the 2024/25 Premier League season, City have struggled to match the standard set by themselves in previous seasons, as they continue to miss midfield star Rodri who suffered a season-ending injury in September.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United’s Carrington Training Centre has played host to some of the best footballers of all time – but it would be turned into something entirely different if a war was to happen.\n\nCarrington replaced United’s ‘The Cliff’ training ground in the year 2000. Since opening its doors, the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney have used its facilities – whether that be the carpet-like training pitches, gym facilities or boot rooms.\n\nFormer United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, 82, previously revealed that there was a bizarre clause written into the contract to buy the land. This included ‘untouched’ areas for Canada Geese as well as an odd scenario involving a potato farm.\n\n\"The Cliff was great when I first came, but then the club grew,” he told the UTD Podcast in September 2021. \"We had to put an extension in the indoor place for the boys to dress because we had no space in the actual building.\n\"So, then I started to wander around Manchester looking for a piece of ground that we could build a new training ground on. \n\"We’re hunting everywhere, in North Manchester in particular.\"\n\nThe Scot then explained how former chief scout and academy director Les Kershaw approached him with a friend from Shell. \"He said ‘Shell are trying to sell some of their ground over at Carrington’,... so we went to see. \n\"The size of the land we were getting, I think it was 28 acres or something, but there were restrictions which I can’t understand today.\"\n\"Part of the restrictions were, in the event of war, we had to turn the ground into potato fields,” Ferguson explained. \"And, up at the very end, there had to be an acre or two acres for Canadian geese.”\n\nThe 13-time Premier League-winning manager then revealed how he returned to Old Trafford during Louis van Gaal’s tenure as manager only to find that the Dutchman had put stands and floodlights up around the venue.",

      "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?\" when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka, and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability”.\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “[Kai] Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention “striker” qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fans’ claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference via Arsenal.com.\n\n“The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations. I think he’s an amazing example of that.”",

      "article_text": "Ally McCoist has opened up on living with Dupuytren’s contracture; an incurable condition that causes his fingers to bend towards his palms.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Rangers striker, who recently received an OBE for services to football and broadcasting, is arguably one of the most popular pundits in the game through his work with Amazon Prime, TNT Sports and ITV.\n\nHe is also a regular on radio station talkSPORT and this week, McCoist revealed that he is suffering from an incurable condition that impacts his everyday life.\n\nDupuytren's contracture, also known as Viking disease, is an abnormal thickening of the skin in the palm of the hand which can cause the fingers to curl towards the palm or pull sideways.\n\nIt has been given the name Viking disease due to its prevalence in the north of Europe and those of Northern European descent.\n\nAccording to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool. Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three. \n\n“I don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason. Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds when speaking to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

      "article_text": "Lyon winger Rayan Cherki's stats have been compared to Premier League talents Cole Palmer and Phil Foden amid his transfer links to Liverpool.\n\nLast week it was reported that Liverpool were considering making a move for French winger Cherki as a potential replacement to superstar Mohamed Salah if they are unable to agree on a new deal for the Egyptian.\n\nThe 21-year-old has impressed in recent years, drawing attention from some of the biggest clubs across Europe, including Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBut how would Cherki compare with the links of some of the best young talents in the Premier League if he were to secure a move to Liverpool in the summer?\n\nThroughout his career, the 21-year-old attacker has been compared to Eden Hazard due to his style of play, abilities with both feet and his physical build, but when considering his stats against players like Palmer and Foden, we learn a lot about Cherki.\n\nSo far this season, stars provided by Opta, via Squawka, show that Cherki has made seven domestic appearances for the Ligue One side, scoring one goal and assisting another, while averaging 0.8 shots on target per 90 minutes played.\n\nMeanwhile Foden is yet to score a Premier League goal this season despite featuring in eight matches for reigning champions Manchester City. The Englishman, who has over 100 minutes more than Cherki this season, has one assist in the League so far and averages just 0.2 shots on target per 90.\n\nFar in front of both Cherki and Foden in terms of stats this season is Chelsea superstar Palmer, who has scored an impressive seven goals and assisted five in 11 Premier League appearances. And, while the 22-year-old has enjoyed considerably more minutes than either Cherki or Foden, he boasts the most shots on target per 90 minutes with an average of 1.3.\n\nHowever, Cherki is very low in terms of defensive metrics, but this could be due to Lyon's style of play overall.",

      "headline": "‘I can be ruthless’: Ruben Amorim warns United of tough times ahead",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has warned his Manchester United players he has a ruthless streak he will not be afraid to use if they fail to meet his demands. The Portuguese has a reputation as an astute man-manager as well as an innovative tactician but it will not all be sweetness and light.\n\nThe 39-year-old begins life as head coach at Ipswich on Sunday aware of the task ahead as he tries to turn United around. Amorim arrived with the team 13th in the Premier League after four wins from 11 matches and needing to improve results if they are to have ambitions of European qualification for next season.\n\n“I can be ruthless when I have to be,” Amorim said. “If you think as a team I will be the nicest guy that you have ever seen, if there is someone just thinking that, I will be a different person. I’m not that kind of guy that wants to show that he is a boss. They will feel it in the small details. I can be the smiling one, but then when you have a job to do I will be a different person, and they understand that.”\n\nAmorim insists he will take risks to change the tactics and style but will have limited training time because of United’s hectic schedule. There will be two games a week for the foreseeable future as United balance domestic and European competition. Amorim will get his first taste of Old Trafford on Thursday when Bodø/Glimt visit in the Europa League.\n\n“It’s so much harder to come to a team in the middle of the season,” Amorim said, “because you have to know the players during the games, so you are talking about no national-team periods to work with the players – it’s just games. If you are winning, it’s a lot of fun having a lot of games, trying to make some changes tactically and winning. But if you are losing, you don’t have the time in training to work out everything you want to work.\n\n“Where you can improve a team is in training; this is the most important aspect. You can tell the players to recover and to react really fast but if you don’t make any exercise with that it’s really hard to do it on video or during recovery training but we will find ways to try to cope.”\n\nAlthough Amorim’s predecessor, Erik ten Hag, won a trophy in each of his two full seasons, that United have not secured the league title since 2013 looms large over Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson was the most recent United manager to lift the trophy. He did so 13 times and is the club’s most successful manager.\n\n“It’s hard to copy someone, so I have to be me,” Amorim said when asked whether he had sought Ferguson’s advice. “I’m not the best person to show the history of Manchester United. It should be the club first and also me, because I’m always paying attention to those details and try to focus our players on the history of the club, but not the recent history.\n\n“You have to be very demanding. This is a club that needs to win, it has to win – we have to show that to our players. It’s a different time; I cannot be the same guy Sir Alex Ferguson was. I have to have a different approach but I can also be demanding with a different approach. That is my focus.",

      "article_text": "Previous incumbents in the Old Trafford hotseat have shown that first impressions can often prove misleading.\n\n**Alex Ferguson, Oxford 2-0 Manchester United, 8 Nov 1986**  \nTwo days after leaving Aberdeen, Ferguson sent out an XI including Paul McGrath, Jesper Olsen, Peter Davenport, Graeme Hogg and Clayton Blackmore that fell to a 16th-minute John Aldridge penalty and an 89th-minute Neil Slatter strike. \"It was a nightmare trying to concentrate with so much media attention and so many cameramen on top of me,\" Ferguson said. \"They [the players] were a bit uptight and they wanted to do well.\" None were in the 1-0 1990 FA Cup final replay triumph over Crystal Palace, Ferguson’s first trophy, though Blackmore was an unused substitute. Twenty-six and a half years after the Oxford reverse Ferguson retired as the UK’s greatest manager and a knight.\n\n**David Moyes, Swansea 1-4 Manchester United, 17 Aug 2013**  \nThe 2-0 Community Shield victory over Wigan was followed six days later by a hammering of Swansea that featured another two Robin van Persie goals, plus Danny Welbeck’s double. Rio Ferdinand, who started in central defence, said: \"The season’s started and we are really looking forward to it. We see the things said in the media and every next person is tipping someone else to win the league and putting us in third or fourth place.\" The media were over-optimistic. United, the reigning champions, ended seventh with 64 points, 22 behind Manchester City, Moyes having been sacked after 34 league matches.\n\n**Louis van Gaal, Manchester United 1-2 Swansea, 16 Aug 2014**  \nLike Ferguson the Dutchman lost but Van Gaal’s sinking experience came before a hushed home crowd. Wayne Rooney’s 53rd-minute goal cancelled Ki Sung-yueng’s first-half opener for the Swans but Gylfi Sigurdsson struck again for the visitors as United, under Van Gaal, began with a four-game losing streak that included a 4-0 League Cup trouncing at MK Dons. Two years later, after leading United to the 2016 FA Cup – a first piece of post-Ferguson silverware – Van Gaal was sacked.\n\n**José Mourinho, Bournemouth 1-3 Manchester United, 14 Aug 2016**  \nJuan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired the Special One to a fine opening-weekend victory a week after the 2-1 Community Shield win against Leicester, igniting a four-match winning sequence. By the campaign’s close Mourinho had added the League Cup and Europa League to the club’s cabinet room and the following season United finished second. But a \"respect, respect, respect\" tirade at this writer after a 3-0 home loss to Tottenham in August 2018 signalled the beginning of the end for Mourinho, who was gone by that December.\n\n**Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United 2-1 Watford, 30 Mar 2019**  \nAfter three months as a caretaker after Mourinho’s sacking, the Norwegian was made the No 1 and could thank Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial for the dream beginning (Abdoulaye Doucouré scored late for the Hornets). But after losing only three games of 19 as interim manager, the Watford victory was followed that season by just one more win – 2-1 over West Ham. Six defeats and two draws were Solskjær’s other results in the closing third of 2018-19 as United limped to sixth. Third- and second-place finishes followed in his two complete seasons yet on 22 November 2021 he was axed.\n\n**Erik ten Hag, Manchester United 1-2 Brighton, 7 Aug 2022**  \nA humbling for the fifth permanent post-Ferguson manager that prompted Ten Hag to declare it a \"hell of a job\" afterwards. Christian Eriksen was chosen as a false 9 and proved as poor as United’s execution of the \"proactive\" football their manager had trumpeted. The display was an apt harbinger of Ten Hag’s shaky reign which garnered a League Cup and third place plus last season’s FA Cup but which ended on 28 October, before Ruben Amorim’s hiring.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim eyes golden chance as he enters Manchester United vortex",
      "article_text": "With his breezy manner, shock of jet-black wavy hair and declaration that “we choose our way 100%”, Ruben Amorim exuded the fresh energy Manchester United need in his debut media conference at a crammed Jimmy Murphy Centre.\n\nWith only four points to third place, there is a golden chance to transform the season. Yet the issues Amorim wrestles with are the club he has walked into and the squad he has inherited.\n\nThe 39-year-old was enthusiastic about his “many meetings” at United and was firm regarding his belief in the players he drills on the pitches outside. Wearing a club tracksuit top with red front panels and blue sleeves, Amorim was as open under questioning as Erik ten Hag could be taciturn. But different personalities did not prevent the Dutchman, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær from being sucked into the black hole of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson United.\n\nIt is a vortex that cannot be comprehended until experienced. The above quintet can point to how mismanagement at executive level caused the fatal corollary of muddled player recruitment. So Amorim’s task is to work the oracle with a squad that apart from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Martínez and Marcus Rashford (if he can rediscover consistency) is average.\n\nAsked why he believed in a group that got Ten Hag the sack, Amorim said: “The only thing I ask: hard work and you have to believe in the new idea. And I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players.”\n\nAs United’s new football chief, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was billed as the required boardroom reset. But after failing to axe Ten Hag in the summer, United invested £200m on five footballers wanted by the manager – Manuel Ugarte, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee – before a puzzling Ratcliffe U-turn removed the Dutchman last month.\n\nSo a reasonable view is that the minority owner and his chief executive, Omar Berrada, and sporting director, Dan Ashworth, are yet to show spectacular improvement on the two previous power axes of Richard Arnold/John Murtough and Ed Woodward/Murtough; and that Amorim may end as the latest man in the Old Trafford hot seat ejected by dodgy decisions from above.\n\nFor now, he has a unit that includes 14 Ten Hag recruits who have to be weaved into his 3-4-3 along with Fernandes and Rashford, who predated his predecessor and whose maverick talents are vital yet tricky to fit into a cohesive unit.\n\nAmorim presented the challenge this way: “I don’t know about repair but we have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas: the understanding of the game, I know it’s a different way of playing, and we are changing in the middle of the season.\n\n“We have to improve the physical aspect. And that’s it. I don’t know how long it will take. I know when you are in Manchester United you have to win games. So I will not tell you that I need a lot of time. It’s a great league, it’s the strongest league in the world and we have to improve a lot to try to win it. So what I can say is we have to win games to win time and then to win titles.” This is what he is being paid the thick end of €10m (£8.3m) a year for.\n\nTen Hag finished third in his opening season but this was achieved with a misfiring attack that managed only 58 goals and United had a goal difference of 15, the division’s sixth-best. The key then was Rashford’s 17 Premier League goals, so reviving a forward who packs pace, height, strength and verve is as high on Amorim’s list as fitting him and Fernandes into his unfamiliar shape.\n\nOf this, Amorim said: “It’s not revolution because football is not so different with five players in the back, three players in the back or four players in the back. I cannot say evolution because we will have to wait and see but we will play a different type of football.\n\n“We have our ideas. I’m not saying these are the best ideas, but it’s our way of seeing football. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football. We lose the ball too often and we have to keep the ball. We have to be better running back. That is clear for everybody. And we have to be very good in the details. Sometimes we are hoping to change a lot of things, big things.\n\n“It’s also the small things and we are here to improve on the small things, the way we see football, play as a team. Understanding the game in one way, that is the focus. I can tell you in the small things I can help these players a lot.”\n\nThe Portuguese, who fielded questions from nine journalists who flew in from his homeland, will have to if he is to achieve United’s holy grail of a 21st championship. A zesty charisma will help. It was on display again when he was asked about his compatriot Mourinho.\n\n“I’m different,” Amorim said. “You looked at Mourinho and you felt he can win everywhere. He was European champion. I’m not European champion. I’m a different guy in a different moment.\n\n“Football nowadays is different and I am the right person at the moment. I am a young guy, I understand the players, so I try to use that to help my players. It is still the best club in England and we want to win.”",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United are years away from the title",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has denied that being Manchester United’s head coach is the impossible job but says his two-and-a-half-year contract is not long enough to win the title.\n\nAmorim is United’s sixth permanent appointment since they were last Premier League champions, under Sir Alex Ferguson, in May 2013. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag failed to make them contenders. He was reminded of this and asked whether United was the impossible job.\n\n“No, of course not,” the 39-year-old said. “Call me naive but I believe I am the right guy at the right moment. I could be wrong but the Earth still will turn, the sun will rise again. It doesn’t matter, I’m not worried about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job. I really don’t know the biggest challenge here – I will find out during the next months.\n\n“I’m a little bit of a dreamer, and I believe in myself, I also believe in the club. We have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help, but I truly believe in the players also. I know you guys don’t believe a lot in these players. But I believe a lot. We have room to improve, I want to try new things. You guys think it’s not possible; I think it’s possible. We will see in the end.”\n\nAmorim is contracted until summer 2027 but believes longer is required to claim United a 21st title. “I have two years and a half. In two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. We will need more time – if you look at the clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time.\n\n“I understand we will need more than two and a half years. We have to win something, somewhere, but in two years you can understand if you want to continue this part with him or change.\n\n“You have here different types of coaches: the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjær, then one of the best outside the top five leagues – Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we have to win games. You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do the Ineos way, my way.”\n\nAmorim was asked why he had confidence in players whose form caused Ten Hag to be sacked. United are 13th but only four points behind third-placed Chelsea.\n\n“You have to believe and I believe in them,” he said. “When I start this week … you can say only one week training but they are open to different things. The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the idea.”\n\nHe accepts the squad has lost confidence. “That is for sure but normal. When players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm-up if they are confident or not. I have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then in the second half they will change so they have to find that mindset.”\n\nAmorim’s opening game is Sunday’s trip to Ipswich and he said he would stick with his 3-4-3 system. “As a coach you have to choose one way or another,” he said. “I always choose 100% our way. I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way.\n\n“We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting XI and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball.”\n\nAmorim wants a major influence regarding recruitment. “We have to improve the process of recruitment, the data. It is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. I have to understand the league and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players.\n\n“It is not the final word, but I have a great responsibility when we choose the players.”",

      "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Ruben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim’s rise in management has been rapid in a relatively short time. Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far. The road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.”",

      "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Ruben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!",

      "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane.\n\nSusanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it. [The air stewards] just called for help and help came.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That’s going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.”",

Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s off-the-cuff counterattack play apart, the teams of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Erik ten Hag lacked the dizzying fizz of United’s finest vintages.\n\nWhen Amorim declared after Sporting’s 4-1 Champions League rout of Manchester City on Tuesday night that United cannot play as defensively as the Portuguese champions, he signalled an intent to make his iteration a front-foot, box-office proposition.\n\nHis clear challenge is how to engineer this with a side in 13th place before the weekend’s fixtures – they host Leicester today – and with players unaccustomed to his preferred 3-4-3 configuration. \"United cannot play the way we play, they cannot be so defensive,\" he said after his Sporting side had sat back and waited to play on the break against Pep Guardiola’s City.\n\nHowever, Amorim often harnesses the counterattack against higher-quality opposition and you have to wonder if United will be markedly more attacking than Sporting were in midweek. How the Old Trafford crowd will receive this is another matter. Even Solskjær, who restored the bond between club and supporters broken by his predecessor, Mourinho, drew ire for playing on the break.\n\nUntil Amorim can start building the squad he desires, whether his United can excite in his first months in charge will depend on an inherited group of players that are not obviously suited to his direction.\n\nUnited have six central defenders so perming three for any matchday for the rearguard trident should be no problem. If his preferred lineup is Lisandro Martínez, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro (once fit), Amorim faces the question of whether they can initiate his tactics that build attacks from deep.\n\nIn the Portuguese’s middle quartet, the wing-backs at United will be called on to perform an unfamiliar role. At Sporting, Amorim has fielded the pacy Geovany Quenda on the left and Maximiliano Araújo on the right, inverted wing-backs operating on the opposing flank to their natural sides. At United Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are candidates as right-sided defenders whom Amorim could select on either flank. Beyond whether they are able to adapt to the position, it will be intriguing to see whether either has the pace required to operate expertly by sprinting back and forward in attack and defence.\n\nAmorim has a further problem regarding the reliability of two injury-plagued left-backs in Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The manager could plump for Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to patrol the corridors but neither are renowned for their defensive discipline.\n\nAntony may feel a flatlining United career has a chance of revival with a move to the position but, now in a third season at United, this seems an outside prospect. If this key part of the XI does not function, Amorim could consider a return to Sporting to sign one of Quenda and Araújo but with funds limited a January move may not be possible.\n\nCentral midfield presents another conundrum. If Amorim wishes to operate a flat four then he must find a way to fit in the two creative forces of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes. But there would be no room for either Manuel Ugarte, as a dedicated holding player, or Casemiro.\n\nA diamond formation may be the solution, with Ugarte or Casemiro at the base, plus wing-backs either side and Fernandes or Mainoo at the tip. But one of the latter two would miss out, which, for a team whose heritage demands buccaneering football, seems unlikely and contradicts Amorim’s own declaration that United should not be dour.\n\nHis front three seems the least complicated selection area. On either wing, he can pick two from Garnacho, Rashford and the ever-improving Amad Diallo, with Rasmus Højlund at centre-forward. But definitely far more involved is the requirement to solve the paucity of goals, a mere nine scored in 10 Premier League games.\n\nA calling card of the elite coach is how they adapt to the players already in their squad: footballers’ abilities come first, not the system. It is a mantra of City’s Guardiola, and United are about to discover whether Amorim belongs in a similar class of manager.",

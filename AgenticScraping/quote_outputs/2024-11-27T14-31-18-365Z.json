Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n        \n    *   On fellow defender Lenny Yoro's availability: \"He is available to train but we are working on his fitness, which is important. He is a young guy. We believe in him a lot and we are trying to prepare the best way.\"\n        \n    *   On his first match at Old Trafford: \"Everybody has said it will be a special time. Before the match it will be like a new sensation, but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that match.\"\n        \n    *   Amorim confirmed that there will be squad rotation for Thursday's match: \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games. We are in the beginning of something. They have to feel that they are part of the team.\"\n        \n    *   On Thursday's opponents: \"I'm expecting a very good team, they can win the \\[Norwegian\\] league this week. They run a lot and that is a very good thing for us because we need to improve that. They have some special players on the wings and they can play in the pockets very well.\"\n        \n    *   Amorim was asked if he will ever change his formation: \"We have to do it. When I talk about our structure, I believe we can play in different systems. Nowadays, every team changes their dynamic so we will adapt to that. Right now, we are starting with the beginning and after that we will change different things.\"\n        \n    *   On the lack of goalscorers in recent years: \"Of course there is a concern, but we have to improve as a team. But we have quality players who can score lots of goals. Rasmus \\[Hojlund\\] Joshua \\[Zirkzee\\] and Rashford will score more goals.\"\n        \n    *   On helping Rashford find his best form: \"I will try to help him. It wasn't the best position for him \\[against Ipswich\\], we will try to find the right solution for him. He has to be the first one to really want it.\"\n \n2.  **Pat Nevin**  \n    Former footballer and presenter\n    \n    After [Liverpool's](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) win at [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton), all eyes shifted to the real story on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond.\n    \n    ‌Certainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\n    \n    ‌The fact that they were not demonstrably better than promoted [Ipswich](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town), after a fabulous start, shows the road is long, and he will need some time, probably quite a lot.\n    \n    ‌Will it be a match made in heaven? It has more chance than Steve Cooper had at [Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city). If ever there was a poisoned chalice, this was it for the former [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) manager, that was a union doomed to failure.\n    \n    *   [Not a Man Utd fan? Find your club's page here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/cn8gp7evvg3o)\n        \n    \n3.  **Dale O'Donnell**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Amad Diallo has been working his way into Manchester United’s plans, but now is the time for the winger to stake his importance to Ruben Amorim.\n    \n    Last Sunday, we saw Amad deployed as one of two wing-back options in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town.\n    \n    Amorim had just two training sessions with his matchday squad to prepare his players for their first game.\n    \n    The Portuguese coach wasted no time implementing his preferred 3-4-3 formation, with Diogo Dalot named as the opposite wing-back.\n    \n    After the first two minutes, I thought ‘right, this is clicking instantly’ as Amad went on a sublime driving solo run down the right flank before setting up Marcus Rashford with a brilliant cross.\n    \n    The end result didn’t go United’s way but this was an instant example of the damage Amad can inflict in wide areas as he beat two Ipswich players on his travels.\n    \n    When I watch United, I want our wide players hurting teams down the flanks, and Amad has the energy to be a threat throughout games. That is why Amorim will have a place for the 22-year-old.\n    \n    As a wing-back, Amad is also expected to carry out defensive duties, and he was kept busy in that department at Portman Road with 71 touches of the ball. He won five of his eight duels and made five clearances against the Tractor Boys.\n    \n    Amad could be used as a number 10 in Amorim’s system – alongside Bruno Fernandes – as he has energy in abundance to carry out that role if required, as seen during his stint at Sunderland under Tony Mowbray.\n    \n    The Ivory Coast international has been knocking on the door at United for some time, but he deserves the opportunities he’s got this season.\n    \n    After a match-winning display against PAOK in the Champions League earlier this month, there is reason to believe Amad will become an important player under Amorim at United.\n    \n    Further proof that hard work pays off.\n    \n    _Find more from Dale O'Donnell at_ [_Stretty News_, external](https://strettynews.com/)\n    \n4.  **Alex Turk**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Why did Manchester United not look as good as Sporting against [Ipswich Town](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town) on Sunday? Can this Ruben Amorim fella walk the walk as well as he talks the talk? How is this 3-4-3 system going to click?\n    \n    Those would be questions of an individual needing to understand the reality of the situation Amorim has inherited from Erik ten Hag. \n    \n    Such a drastic change of vision would have been challenging to instil with a full pre-season at his disposal. United visited Portman Road with two training sessions in the tank.\n    \n    Amorim understands that only wins will buy him time, but that has not deterred his repeated cries for patience.\n    \n    As long as he persists with his three-at-the-back philosophy and his guarantee of a clear identity - something United have missed for far too long - supporters will offer the patience he desires.\n    \n    Not much sense is required to understand why the Red Devils did not enjoy a winning start to life under Amorim at Ipswich.\n    \n    It was simple. The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal. \n    \n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\n    \n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\n    \n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\n    \n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results. \n    \n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\n    \n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\n    \n**NOTE:** Please note that the date of the game's article comes from multiple mentions, confirming it was regarding an event dated 2024-11-25.",

Amorim conceded the centre forward's role is not Rashford's best.\n\n\"I will try to help him,\" Amorim assured. \"That position is not the best one for him, especially in a game like that. We have to kick with high pressure, we have to kick the ball so many times and it was like fighting with two giants.\n\n\"We'll try to find the right solution for him, as for the other players.

But he has to be the first one to want it.\"\n\nAmorim started Rashford ahead of £108.5million striker duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. Hojlund has managed only two goals in 12 appearances this term while Zirkzee has got one in 18.\n\nSenior figures at United are unconvinced by Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna for £36.5m in the summer, and United still have a 0 goal difference in the Premier League, having mustered a mere 13 goals in 12 fixtures.\n\n\"Of course, there is a concern in that but I think we have to improve as a team,\" Amorim said of United's goalscoring issues. \"Because we have quality players who can score so many goals.\n\n\"But you could feel it in the second half, we controlled possession of the ball but we were not dangerous. Maybe because we spent the week trying to work on build-up and then the rest was not working.\n\n\"We will try to improve as a team and Rasmus and Josh and Rash will score more goals, even Bruno (Fernandes) has to score more goals! Amad has to be better near the goal, all these guys need to improve and we can score so many goals.\n\n\"We need to improve as a team and these players can score goals.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\nRuben Amorim could be about to unleash a new Manchester United defence\n\n**Comment**\n\n*   [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford)\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)",

(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed Lisandro Martinez is in contention for Thursday night's Europa League clash with Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Argentine international missed United's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday because of a back problem he suffered prior to the international break that forced him to pull out of the Argentina squad.\n\nHowever, fellow centre-back Harry Maguire, who trained alongside Martinez in Wednesday morning's opening training session, will not be available for the visit of the Norwegian club. He has missed the last eight matches with a muscle issue.\n\nMaguire last featured for United when they drew 0-0 with Aston Villa at Villa Park on October 6.\n\nMeanwhile, Leny Yoro, despite not being involved in training on Wednesday morning, is also available for selection. United, however, are keen not to rush his recovery after so long on the sidelines with a fractured metatarsal.\n\nKey Events\n\n- Martinez in contention for tomorrow night\n\nRuben Amorim has stressed Marcus Rashford has \"to want it\" if he is to regain his prolific form.\n\nRashford, 27, scored his fifth goal of the season in Amorim's first match in charge at Ipswich Town on Sunday but the academy graduate has only tallied 13 club goals since the start of last season.\n\nAmorim said:\n> \"We'll try to find the right solution for him, as for the other players. But he has to be Marcus, first of all, to try to return to that moment and then he will have all the help of the staff, the club and the fans because he's a Manchester United boy. But he has to be the first one to want it.\"\n\n- FULL STORY: Amorim issues Rashford warning\n\nThat concludes this lunchtime's press conference from Ruben Amorim and Bruno Fernandes. Stay tuned to the Manchester Evening News website for more reaction and build up to tomorrow night's game.\n\n- Amorim on Rashford\n\n> \"That position is not the best for him [vs Ipswich]. He was fighting with two giants. We will keep looking for solutions. He will have all the help of all the staff and fans. He is a Manchester United boy.\"\n\n- Amorim on the lack of a reliable goalscorer\n\n> \"I think there is a concern in that, but we have to improve as a team. We controlled the ball in the second half [vs Ipswich] but we were not dangerous. Rasmus and Josh will score more goals. Amad has to be better nearer the goal. Bruno has to score more goals.\"\n\n- Fernandes on if Amorim's system will be easier for older or younger players to adapt to\n\n> \"I think it could be worse for the younger players because for me, I know what the Sporting players were doing. I wasn't reading what the manager was doing there; I was watching their games. When I go to the national team, sometimes we play with a back-three, sometimes I play as a No.10, sometimes I play wide. You always have to move. I don't think age should be a problem, either older or younger. It is about carrying the most you can from the dynamics. As the manager has said, you do not need to overthink things, you just need to know you have a base and a foundation.\"\n\n- Amorim on players adapting to his style\n\n> \"It is not a surprise. These are different things. I have to use the names of the players to explain the situation to you guys. I have explained why we had some problems in the first half. It was not a problem with the players; it was about me [and my ideas]. I believe we can play in different systems. Sometimes we defended in a 4-4-2 [vs Ipswich]. We have to play in different systems because nowadays teams change their dynamic. I think our structure, the power of this structure, is to change formation in each game.\"\n\n- Amorim on his players needing to 'suffer'\n\n> \"It is a different league and it is harder than in Portugal. But I also have experienced players who play in their national teams. Having a lot of games without time to train means it will be difficult for me, but be tougher for them.\"\n\n- Amorim on if Bodo/Glimt will rotate\n\n> \"I am not thinking about that; I am just focusing on winning our first game in Old Trafford. If you win, it is a big help. I know the players and the way the team [Bodo/Glimt] plays. I am focused on seeing things in my squad.\"\n\n- Amorim on Bodo/Glimt\n\n> \"I am expecting a tough game. They run a lot and we need to improve that. They have some special players in the wings. They are winning all the time so I am expecting a very, very intense game and a good game. It will be a good game.\"\n\n- Amorim on an apology from Ed Sheeran\n\n> \"In Portugal it is so different. He was just saying hello to one of the commentators and it was nothing. I was with Roy Keane and he is one of the starts. It was nothing, it's OK.\"\n\n- Fernandes on playing in attack\n\n> \"You always have to adapt to different ideas and different systems. You always have to adapt. It is not difficult for me to attack in different positions. I try to have an understanding of the game, as being the captain the manager can give the message from the bench to the pitch. Having the knowledge of every position, knowing the movements, is also in my role.\"\n\n- Fernandes on a mid-season managerial change\n\n> \"If you change a manager mid-season it is because things are not going as you want. If things are not going as you want, everyone has to take the blame. As I have said before, it is easier to get rid of a manager than 15 or 20 players.\"\n\n- Amorim hints at rotation\n\n> \"They [the squad] is already split. If Bruno trains tomorrow, he cannot train for two days. He can only train slowly. Some of the guys will field the game, some of the guys will train the next day.\"\n\n- Amorim on his first home game\n\n> \"It will be a special time. I just want to win the game. Before the match it will be like a new sensation. After the whistle, it will just be another game. We have a lot of games and we are in the beginning of something. We will try to win every game, not just focus on this game and have a clear idea of how to play.\"\n\n- Yoro update\n\n> \"He is training. We believe a lot of him and we are preparing the best way to start with Leny.\"\n\n- Martinez in contention for tomorrow night\n\n> \"Not Harry, Licha is ready. He didn't stop too much time, so I feel he is ready. The situation is different to Harry's.\"\n\n- Here they are\n\nUnited head coach Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes are now in position and the press conference is about to begin.\n\n- A small delay\n\nWe are still waiting on Ruben Amorim and Bruno Fernandes to appear for this press conference. We will update you as soon as they are in position and we're ready to start.",

We need to improve that. So we know in this game we have to run a lot.\n\n\"They have some special players on the wings, they can play on the pockets very well and they have that aura of winning games and this is because they are winning all the time.\n\n\"I’m expecting a very, very intense game, a very good game, and I hope to see different things, improve some things we didn't do so well in the last game so it will be a good game.\"\n\nCentre backs Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez returned to training on Wednesday but Maguire will not be considered for selection against Bodo/Glimt after recovering from a hamstring injury. Martinez is available to play.\n\nLeny Yoro was not involved in the open session as he had a designated recovery day as he continues his rehabilitation from a metatarsal fracture.\n\n\"Licha is ready,\" Amorim clarified. \"He didn’t stop too many times so I felt he’s ready. It’s a different situation with Harry. We need both of them but they are in different situations. They are both training, Harry will be on the pitch soon also.\n\n\"(Yoro)'s available to train but we are working on his fitness. It’s important. He is a young guy, this is a massive club, it’s very important, the first image, we will try to put everything together because he’s a great talent, we believe a lot in him and we are trying to prepare the best way to start with Leny.\"\n\nAmorim will take charge of United at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) for the first time on Thursday evening. \"Everybody said to me that it will be a special time, I just want to win the game, just to give that happiness to the supporters.\n\n\"Before the match it will be like a new sensation but after the whistle it will be one more game and we want to win that much.\"\n\nUnited are certain to rotate ahead of nine matches in December. Martinez could come in for Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw is vying for a first club start since February 18, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are in line for recalls and Amorim must decide whether to recall either of the £108.5million strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.\n\n\"We have to do it,\" Amorim said of rotation. \"We have to do it, especially in this moment because we have a lot of games and we are in the beginning of something. They have to feel they are part of the team, they are international players, they will rotate, we will try to manage and try to win every game, have a clear idea of how to play and everybody has to be on the same page.\"\n\nAmorim also clarified the method of splitting the squad into groups depending on their playing time. \"They are already split because if Bruno (Fernandes) plays tomorrow he cannot train for two days. Even the day before the next match, he cannot train, just slowly, jogging, they are already split.\n\n\"Some guys that don't play in the next day of the match will train, they will have an opportunity for a real training session. That’s what I meant at the time. Some guys will play, some guys will have an opportunity to have a training session. In the next game, we will change positions.\n\n\"Some of the guys will feel the game and some of the guys that don’t play will train the next day, that’s all.\"\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   [Ruben Amorim could be about to unleash a new Manchester United defence](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30456054?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United supporters group announce ticket price protest ahead of Everton fixture](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-supporters-group-announce-30461312?int_source=nba)",

United were light on centre-backs at Portman Road, travelling to Suffolk without Victor Lindelof, Leny Yoro, Maguire and Martinez.\n\nYoro was missing from training on Wednesday morning as he was on a designated recovery day, likewise Jonny Evans. Yoro is not yet participating in every training session after so long sidelined.\n\nAmid their centre-back shortage at the weekend, 16-year-old Godwill Kukonki was included in the travelling squad, but he was left out of the matchday squad by Amorim.\n\nUnited lined up with a back-three against Ipswich, with Amorim handing starts to Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt and Evans. De Ligt started in the centre of the trio and is expected to be a mainstay in Amorim's plans once he finds himself in a position to unleash his strongest defensive line.",

(Image: CBS Sports.)\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards believes Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim could add \"five or six\" players to his squad in next summer's transfer window.\n\nAmorim was installed as United's new head coach earlier this month, succeeding Erik ten Hag, and oversaw a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road in his first game in charge on Sunday afternoon.\n\nUnited made a flying start in Suffolk, scoring inside the opening two minutes via Marcus Rashford, but were pegged back just before half-time via a deflected effort from Omari Hutchinson.\n\nHad it not been for goalkeeper Andre Onana, United would have made the trip back to Manchester empty handed, with the Cameroonian making a cluster of impressive saves.\n\nNevertheless, there was enough evidence on show to offer an insight into what Amorim wants to change at Old Trafford. And for Richards, he believes time will be key for the new United boss, but that he will have to wait until next summer before he can put his own stamp on the squad he has inherited.\n\nRichards, reflecting on United's performance against Ipswich, told The Rest is Football podcast: \"They looked alive, they looked sharp. All the things you thought [would happen]. I was getting excited, and then it just went flat.\n\n\"I don't think he [Amorim] is going to get the players he wants in January, but I think in the summer, we are going to see five or six players come in now. I just believe that.\n\n\"I was a bit disappointed in the showing. That's not the manager – he needs time to implement his style.\n\n\"It was almost like a fizzy drink. I expected so much; they started so well, and then it just fizzled out a bit. On another day, Ipswich could have scored four or five.\"",

        "article_text": "Man United handed unlikely Viktor Gyokeres transfer boost after Gabriel celebration drama - Jack Flintham - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have been linked with a move for Viktor Gyokeres since Ruben Amorim's move to Old Trafford was confirmed at the beginning of November.\n\nFine lines often secure transfers in football and Manchester United are no strangers to this practice.\n\nWho could forget Dimitar Berbatov choosing United when seemingly certain to move to Manchester City after Sir Alex Ferguson's last-minute intervention? Or, Alan Shearer shopping for houses in Manchester only to pull the plug on a United move and return to Newcastle instead.\n\nOver the course of a club's history, they will be the beneficiaries or the victims of these fine lines over and over again. However, it is rare that a team can benefit passively from the acts of a third party but United could become the exception to that rule.\n\nIt is no secret that United and Arsenal both have Viktor Gyokeres on their radars. The Gunners' interest is more long-term having been interested in him since the summer while speculation surrounding the Reds arose following the arrival of Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mikel Arteta's side were able to witness Gyokeres' talents first-hand in the Champions League but it was a night for him to forget as the Swede's side lost 5-1. Insult would be added to injury for the striker in first-half stoppage time when Arsenal defender Gabriel chose to perform the striker's celebration as the Gunners raced into a 3-0 lead.\n\nGyokeres did not notice it at the time but seemed less than impressed when informed of it. \"Gabriel’s celebration? He’s welcome to steal it if he can’t create his own celebration,\" he told reporters post-match.\n\n\"I didn’t know he did that, but it’s fun he likes my celebration.\" The actions of both players may have come in the heat of the moment but it is unlikely that Gabriel's actions will have done anything to warm the Swede towards signing for Arsenal.\n\nFootballers can be overly protective about their celebrations and players stealing them can often be seen as disrespectful. As such, United could use the Arsenal defender's actions to prove to Gyokeres that Old Trafford would be a better home for him come next summer.\n\nThey were already the favourites prior to Gabriel's gesture, now Amorim's hand has been strengthened further.",

        "article_text": "Man United's dream Ruud van Nistelrooy scenario ended by Frank Lampard - Jack Flintham - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have just missed out on what could have been the perfect arrangement as Ruud van Nistelrooy's search for a new job goes on.\n\nThere is no shortage of managers in the EFL with links to Manchester United on their resume.\n\nMichael Carrick and Steve Bruce are just two names that instantly spring to mind when thinking about United alumni plying their trade in the English lower divisions. However, neither man has used their contacts at Old Trafford recently to bring players to their respective clubs, most likely due to Ineos' takeover making that prospect more difficult as relations once there would need to be forged again.\n\nHowever, this option looked to be back on the table recently when Ruud van Nistelrooy was linked with the Coventry City job. After they sacked another ex-United striker in Mark Robins, the Dutchman was tipped to be a contender for the job with the Sky Blues.\n\nVan Nistelrooy's relationship, unlike that of Carrick or Bruce, remains fresh with United having been employed by Ineos as recently as the beginning of this month. His exit was by no means down to their relationship breaking but rather Ruben Amorim's preference to bring his own staff to the club.\n\nEven once Erik ten Hag was sacked, Van Nistelrooy still held a desire to work with Ineos at United. But while things did not work out, the door was still open for the former striker to use these new contacts to secure impressive loans for a new club.\n\nSadly, this dream scenario, which could have seen youngsters and fringe players gain important minutes in the Championship, has now been ended by Frank Lampard. The Chelsea legend looks set to be named the Sky Blues' new manager and will more than likely use his connections at Stamford Bridge to try and improve Coventry in January.\n\nFortunately for United, the Van Nistelrooy dream scenario is not out of reach yet. Leicester City and Hamburg remain linked with the Dutchman, who previously held the role of head coach at PSV Eindhoven, so the idea is not dead yet but one avenue that had looked likely for a time, has now been closed off.",

Some Manchester Evening News readers would welcome the changes, but others say that the current roster should be given time to prove their worth.\n\nThere are a number of players who could be sold or offloaded to kickstart the Amorim-era rebuild, beginning as soon as January. Joshua Zirkzee has had a drab start to life in the Premier League, for example, and could want a move back to his preferred Serie A in Italy.\n\nThe defensive department needs looking at, with Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire due for a decision as their contracts near an end. Christian Eriksen is in the same boat further forward, while Casemiro could still be sellable - plus a number of United players who have not turned in good performances lately.\n\nReader Jungle Jerry thinks it's much too soon for this kind of talk, but it is inevitable: “Amorim should be given some time to stabilise this team. He will sort out the players. He will soon know which players stay and which players will go. He will know if he needs some of the players from the academy. Definitely no new players coming in till the end of the season. A few will definitely be leaving, if it is possible to sell them. A big loss coming up because a few will be released too.”\n\nCommenter Meda is more positive: “He is a coach, let him coach. No more spending until the summer. And both strikers are young and can be coached. I no longer support those theories that all the players that the previous manager signed are not good enough.”\n\nGarth123 says that a clearout is not urgent: “If the right player becomes available, United will find the money. The media claimed we didn't have much money in summer and yet with the exception of Chelsea we spent the most and with the exception of one player, who the jury is still out on have been sound signings. This season will be a fact-finding project as to who can play within the new system and to select those to move on in the summer.”\n\nSirgreenmantle writes: “Clearing out the old regime is clearly not enough. Some in the new recruitment set-up identified Zirkzee as a viable proposition. There have been many duds in the past but he is up there as a player who least looks like a United player in recent memory. To have him and Antony in the same squad speaks volumes on how far the club still has to go to get to a structure that works.”\n\nSaihulud says: “Money is always available at Man United. It's the decision-making on players that has been wrong every time these past ten years. Before getting in new players, Amorim must get rid of Heaton, Maguire, Lindelof, Evans, Shaw, Malacia, Dalot, Casemiro, Eriksen, Antony, Zirkzee and Rashford.”\n\nJonathanGrosskopf writes: “Methinks that they have too much money and not enough brains to buy well, and develop what they have already. The following need to go: Antony, Zirkzee, Luke Shaw, Mount, Casemiro, Eriksen, Lindelof, Maguire, Evans, Dalot and, sad to say, Rashford, who appears to have lost it.”\n\nBoasy says: “Amorim will do what's right by Utd. He will get Utd kicking again.”\n\n**Have your say! Should a squad rebuild happen sooner rather than later? Or should Amorim be given a chance to teach his ideals - win or lose?**",

United have already been linked with several potential new signings ahead of the January window. Ruben Amorim is the club's new head coach and will be busy assessing the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag over the next few weeks. \n\nIt remains to be seen what players, if any, United will try and sign in January to strengthen their squad for the second half of the season. For now, though, rumours are continuing to swirl that it could be a busy month at Old Trafford.\n\nHere, MEN Sport takes a look at some of the latest United transfer news and gossip that have generated headlines over the last 24 hours.\n\nUnited are being linked with a move for Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. According to Sport Mediaset, the Reds are preparing to submit a contract offer to the Georgia international ahead of a potential move in 2025. \n\nThe report claims that United want to offer Kvaratskhelia a five-year contract that would see him earn approximately £128,000 per week plus bonuses. However, it has not been reported how much United would be prepared to offer Napoli to try and sign the winger. \n\nThe Serie A club are reportedly valuing Kvaratskhelia at €100million (£83.5million). United will apparently face competition from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain for the 23-year-old's signature.\n\nElsewhere, United have reportedly joined the race to sign Wolves star Rayan Ait-Nouri. According to The Sun, United have placed the left-back high on their shortlist of potential transfer targets heading into the January window. \n\nThe report claims that United target Ait-Nouri is weighing up whether or not to pursue a move away from Molineux in 2025. It has been reported that United are determined to sign a left-back in the New Year and that Ait-Nouri fits the bill of the player that would suit Amorim's system.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp missed out on signing a Real Madrid star for £2.5m in 2017, according to reports.\n\nAt the time, Madrid won the 2016/17 La Liga title, while Klopp’s Liverpool side finished fourth in the Premier League.\n\nThat summer, the Reds were in the market for a winger and were in “advanced talks” to sign a then-Santos star.\n\nAccording to the Mirror, Klopp discovered the player on YouTube before pursuing him.\n\nThe report suggests the German had travelled to meet the player in Brazil after being impressed by the footage online.\n\nRodrygo did not join the Reds and has gone on to play 231 times for Madrid, winning two Champions Leagues, three La Ligas and a Copa del Rey - just to name a few of the triumphs in the famous white shirt.\n\nHis former agent, Elano, explained the situation in 2020.\n\n\"He had gone on YouTube, searched 'talents from Brazil', Rodrygo had appeared, and he was very young,” he told Canal do Nicola.\n\n“He [Jurgen Klopp] came to Brazil and liked him. They contacted me, the Liverpool director wanted him to be his first signing, Rodrygo.\"\n\nHowever, he explained how the deal fell through before the Brazilian joined Madrid in 2019 for a fee of £37m.\n\nAnd ironically, the place where he signed his Los Blancos contract rubbed salt in Liverpool’s wounds.\n\nAhead of the 2018 World Cup, Brazil played a warm-up game against Croatia at Anfield.\n\nThe likes of Neymar and Roberto Firmino were the stars of the show, but Rodrygo signed his Madrid contract in a hospitality box inside the stadium on the same day, according to the Mirror’s report.\n\nLiverpool will play host to Madrid on Wednesday evening, but the 23-year-old will likely not feature due to an injury he sustained against Osasuna earlier this month.\n\nThe player previously discussed his failed move to Liverpool in April 2024.\n\n“We didn’t close the deal because I didn’t want to,” he told the Guardian.\n\n“I wanted to stay at Santos even though the offer was very good. The pathway they promised me would also have been very good for my career. I was going to finish my studies in England to prepare for European football.\n\n“It had always been my dream to play in Europe. Everything was very good, but my desire spoke louder.\n\n\"I wanted to stay at Santos and make a bit of history at the club. And that’s what happened: I was able to fulfil my dream of playing for Santos. But it’s true, I almost went to Liverpool.”",

He explained how he had got them in his post-match press conference.\n\n\"I cut it with my finger, my nail,” explained the City boss.\n\nHe then continued saying he wanted to “hurt himself”, before laughing.\n\nNow, he has taken to X to address his comments.\n\n\"I was caught off guard with a question at the end of a press conference last night about a scratch which had appeared on my face and explained that a sharp fingernail had accidentally caused this,” read a post to his official X account.\n\n“My answer was in no way intended to make light of the very serious issue of self harm.\n\n“I know that many people struggle with mental health issues every day, and I would like to take this moment to highlight one of the ways in people can seek help, by calling the Samaritans hotline on 116 123 or emailing jo@samaritans.org.”\n\nGuardiola was less than pleased with his side's lacklustre performance but stressed how his players were \"desperate\" to win against Sporting.\n\n“They feel it, they are desperate to win, that’s why they play the way they play,” the City boss said.\n\n“They played really good in many aspects. How many chances we conceded but again three goals. We made 26 shots against Spurs and lost 4-0.\n\n“We are a team that has conceded so few goals in eight or nine years. We are always so stable and able to defend well and now it’s not happening.\n\n“The game was 3-0 and even more, I don’t remember much - maybe one shot. We cannot close the games and every time they arrive they score.”\n\nThe 53-year-old will no doubt already be planning for his side's trip to Anfield, where they will face Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday afternoon.\n\nCity currently trail Arne Slot's side by eight points and will hoping to reduce the gap this weekend.",

We are going to suffer for a long period. This will take time.”\n\nBut this ‘suffering’ may well be eased in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to [Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14128249/MAN-UNITED-CONFIDENTIAL-United-Viktor-Gyokeres-Ruben-Amorim.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=social-twitter_dailymailsport), United had scouts at Sporting’s 5-1 defeat against Arsenal on Tuesday, with Manchester City among several Premier League clubs 'watching' at the Estadio Jose Alvalade stadium.\n\nThe report suggests that United have ‘made it their priority’ to sign in form Sporting striker [Viktor Gyokeres](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/champions-league/arsenal-sporting-gyokeres-gabriel-celebration-917165-20241127).\n\nThe Swede has netted 67 times in 69 appearances for Sporting since signing from Coventry City in 2023, having scored 24 times in just 20 games so far this term.\n\nAmorim has ‘promised’ not to take players from his old club in January, but this could depend on how United are performing come the transfer window.\n\nPSG left-back Nuno Mendes may also be an option for United.\n\nMendes played under Amorim at Sporting between 2020 and 2022.\n\nGeovany Quenda, 17, and Pedro Goncalves, 26, have also been linked with a potential move to United.\n\nAmorim’s former club are ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign Quenda, according to [A BOLA](https://x.com/abolapt).\n\nThe youngster is under contract at Sporting until June 2027.\n\nAs for Goncalves, he mostly played on the left of a front-three under Amorim – the position Alejandro Garnacho was used in during the draw at Ipswich.

The decision has been greeted with dismay by the supporters’ trust, which fears this is the first step before “a significant price rise” next season.\n\nThe move comes as part of the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s efforts to make United more financially sustainable in the face of losses. Those tickets previously started at £40 for adults and £25 for children. Of the seats available to members across the rest of the season, 97% have been sold and the money raised by the increase is expected to be in the low millions of pounds.\n\nIn the long term Ratcliffe believes more prudent investment in the football operation is the prime way to make United more financially sound. Their debt totals £714m, comprising non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter rose from £36.5m in June’s end-of-year accounts because of United’s revolving credit facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nA Manchester United Supporters Trust statement in response to the ticket price changes said: “The club has provided zero consultation on the matter, neither with the forum nor the Fan Advisory Board nor MUST. We were simply informed of the decision that there will be price rises affecting certain fans that are ‘urgently needed’ to address profitability and sustainability concerns.\n\n“There is a risk that this is only the opening salvo of what will surely be massive pressure to implement a significant price rise for next season. Once they have got used to charging £132 for a parent and child to come to Old Trafford, will they really go back to the old pricing levels for next season?”\n\nUnited and Everton fans will stage a protest against ticket prices before their Premier League clash on Sunday. Supporters are being asked to gather next to the trinity statue outside Old Trafford to support the Football Supporters’ Association’s Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. As well as increasing prices generally, fans are unhappy about the removal of concession tickets for certain groups.",

        "article_headline": "Bodø/Glimt: from Arctic football outpost to centre stage at Old Trafford",
        "article_text": "Bodø/Glimt: from Arctic football outpost to centre stage at Old Trafford\n\n‘It’s been quite a journey,’ says midfielder Ulrik Saltnes of the Norwegian club’s rise, an example across Scandinavia\n\nBack in 2011, Bodø/Glimt were cash-strapped and forced into a routine beloved of park footballers. They were labouring in Norway’s second tier and, as their sporting director, Håvard Sakariassen, puts it, had “hit the wall”. Those long trips from inside the Arctic Circle feel even more onerous when you are doing everything yourself and, as they prepare to visit Manchester United, they would be forgiven a moment to marvel at how the picture has transformed.\n\n“We didn’t have a kit manager so we washed our kit at home and came to training already dressed,” says Sakariassen, who had recently quit as a player and found himself taking de facto responsibility for managing the team’s equipment. “To compare that to our resources today, it is a totally different world.”\n\nIt says everything that, when Bodø/Glimt walk out at Old Trafford, they will neither look nor feel out of place. This is their fifth straight season of European football and they have racked up the scalps. A Roma side managed by José Mourinho were famously thrashed 6-1 at their Aspmyra Stadion in the 2021-22 Conference League. Celtic and, in this season’s Europa League, Porto are among a string of other victims. Arsenal were run mightily close when they visited two years ago. Whereas once there was novelty value in seeing a club from northern Europe’s furthest reaches, and a home town of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, bloodying big-name noses, they now feel like a staple.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey,” says Ulrik Saltnes, a long-serving midfielder who has made 370 appearances since joining in those days when a return to the top flight seemed some way off. “It’s almost hard to imagine really. Everything was so much smaller. There were so fewer people and the level was completely different. From being a team bouncing up and down the leagues to being a stable team in Europe every season since 2020, it’s just not comparable at all.”\n\nThat stability has coincided with the tenure of Kjetil Knutsen, a 56-year-old manager who has been linked with Premier League jobs but remains at the helm of Norway’s dominant force. Bodø/Glimt had never won an Eliteserien title until four years ago, when they streaked away at the top by 19 points. They have claimed two more and, as long as they beat Lillestrøm in a grandstand finale to the domestic campaign on Sunday, will add another.\n\nIt has been a triumph of club-building: a success story unalloyed by wealthy backers or reckless gambles. Bodø/Glimt picked a proactive, progressive style of football and stuck with it, recruiting imaginatively while sticking firmly to their local roots. Bayern Leverkusen’s Nigeria striker Victor Boniface cut his teeth there but the overwhelming majority of Knutsen’s squad is Norwegian. They have been able to reinvest several hefty transfer fees but, as Sakariassen says: “We don’t see ourselves as a selling club.”\n\nInstead they are driven by process. “We don’t have any goals in the club,” Sakariassen continues. “We don’t, before the season, say: ‘Our aim is to become No 1 or 2.’ Or: ‘We’re going to win 80% of the home games.’ We threw that in the bin six years ago. We just work on trying to get better every day, doing the smart things, just working hard and only having one focus: to get the product to get better.”\n\nThey have succeeded in that. Outwardly bigger clubs in Scandinavia readily accept Bodø/Glimt have become a model for how clubs in the region might thrive. A region whose clubs’ influence on the continental stage has faded is represented by a standard bearer few could have expected. It would be a welcome bonus for Sakariassan and his cohort if they could help raise the levels of all around them. “I think you will see Norwegian teams doing well in future,” he says. “We push each other.”\n\nSaltnes points out that domestic opponents have found ways to tackle Bodø/Glimt that European rivals are yet to grasp. The tightness of this year’s title race, Brann poised a point behind, suggests so. Last year Knutsen’s team finished nine points clear of the same opponents so perhaps they will not become the kind of wrecking ball that has dominated similarly sized championships while giving little to the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe focus, though, remains on themselves. Bodø/Glimt’s next local project will be to build a new stadium, although nothing beyond their means. The charmingly atmospheric Aspmyra, which holds will be replaced by a slightly bigger 10,000-capacity venue. It will surely host Champions League football at some stage. They should have made a remarkable debut in this season’s group phase but, having taken a two-goal lead against Red Star Belgrade in the playoffs, were consigned to a 3-2 aggregate defeat.\n\nSuch a close-run thing was a further indicator of their progress. Performing at Old Trafford will be too and there will be some personal significance for Sakariassen, who admits to being one of the many Norwegians who followed United as a youngster. The main source of pride, though, comes from putting his home town near the centre of the European game’s map against all odds.\n\n“When I travel around Europe it’s weird for me, coming from Bodø and knowing the history that we are a small club, that everyone knows us,” he says. “It’s amazing for us, and also to see the impact the club has in Bodø, in the north of Norway and also in Norway. It’s really extraordinary for me as a Bodø/Glimt boy.”",

Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by [Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw71tQBn2e8&). At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of [a beauty at home to Chelsea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRQrnMrBNrU), rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for [Les Sealey’s flesh wound](https://youtu.be/zjaq9dtENS0?si=-szx1pFhLPD41j8H&t=5187) – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede [a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985](https://youtu.be/_HJteklk36s?si=K2Ab22X5qRsq7tBS&t=1417). But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored [seven career goals against United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daa96wmIjg0), was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than _that_!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off [an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998](https://youtu.be/pvmoe9Y43MQ?si=Ip2Fge8WKjeeBw7J&t=245) – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for [Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymt_bLao7Q4), so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

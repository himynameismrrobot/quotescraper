Today in his news conference, Amorim explained he was using Evans to emphasise the point he was making rather than being critical.\n    \n    A couple of answers later, he was talking about players needing to score goals and said Amad Diallo needs to be better at it. This is good, but it is also a bit dangerous because at some point the subtlety might be lost and it will come across as a direct criticism, which it isn't. Then, it will turn into a storm he then has to deal with when he next speaks to the media.\n\n2.  **Josh Lobley**  \n    BBC Sport Journalist\n    \n    Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Europa League game against Bodo/Glimt. Here are the key lines from his news conference:\n    \n    *   He was asked if Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez will be available for Thursday's match: \"Not Harry. Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n    \n3.  **Pat Nevin**  \n    Former footballer and presenter\n    \n    After Liverpool's win at Southampton, all eyes shifted to the real story on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond. Certainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\n    \n4.  **Dale O'Donnell**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Amad Diallo has been working his way into Manchester United’s plans, but now is the time for the winger to stake his importance to Ruben Amorim. Last Sunday, we saw Amad deployed as one of two wing-back options in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town. Amorim had just two training sessions with his matchday squad to prepare his players for their first game. The Portuguese coach wasted no time implementing his preferred 3-4-3 formation, with Diogo Dalot named as the opposite wing-back...\n    \nThis is good, but it is also a bit dangerous because at some point the subtlety might be lost and it will come across as a direct criticism, which it isn't. Then, it will turn into a storm he then has to deal with when he next speaks to the media.\n    \nWhen I watch United, I want our wide players hurting teams down the flanks, and Amad has the energy to be a threat throughout games. That is why Amorim will have a place for the 22-year-old.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his Manchester United plan.\n\nMan United head coach Ruben Amorim will have learnt a lot from his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nToday (Tuesday) marks exactly a year to the day since Kobbie Mainoo made his first Premier League start, starring in a 3-0 win for Manchester United over Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nThe midfielder had missed the start of the season after suffering an ankle injury in pre-season, and after three appearances on the bench, former United manager Erik ten Hag made the decision to unleash him from the start against the Toffees.\n\nThat particular trip to Merseyside will always be remembered most for Alejandro Garnacho's stunning acrobatic effort just three minutes in. However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\n\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th Premier League start and not his first.\n\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of United's 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\n\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make Ruben Amorim's first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\n\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and Amad in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\n\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\n\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\n\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\n\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\n\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\n\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\n\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\n\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. Without even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.",

        "article_text": "Ian Wright has explained why Manchester United could still qualify for Europe in Ruben Amorim's first season as the club's head coach.\n\nAmorim was appointed as United boss earlier this month following the departure of Erik ten Hag. The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nAmorim was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\n\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former Premier League striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at Old Trafford after several new signings are added to the squad.\n\n\"Because Manchester United were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for Optus Sport.\n\n\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\n\n\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\n\n\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\n\n\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager. Sixth, easy!\"",

        "article_text": "Lionel Messi has previously admitted that Barcelona players \"hated\" a Premier League club more than bitter rivals Real Madrid – and it was something he \"never thought\" he would say.\n\nThe Argentine was only a teenager when he decided to go public with the comments during an interview with the News of the World in 2005.\n\nAt the time, there was bad blood between Barcelona and Chelsea after the Blues produced a memorable comeback at Stamford Bridge in what was a dramatic Champions League last-16 clash.\n\nA week earlier, Jose Mourinho made some not-so-subtle comments about referee Anders Frisk after Didier Drogba was controversially sent off in the first leg.\n\nThe two-legged clash left a bitter taste in the mouth of Barcelona players. In fact, ahead of their last-16 clash in 2006, an 18-year-old Messi was vocal about Chelsea.\n\n\"There are [Barcelona] players here who hate Chelsea more than [Real Madrid],\" he said.\n\n\"I never thought I would hear myself say that. I also never thought I would see something worse than the Boca and River Plate rivalry or Brazil vs Argentina - but this is.\n\n\"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"\n\nMessi would go on to produce a superb display for the Catalan side, despite being hacked down by Chelsea defender Asier Del Horno, who was sent off for a shocking challenge on the Argentine.\n\nAn own goal from John Terry and a late strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a first leg advantage before they knocked Jose Mourinho's side out following a 1-1 draw at the Camp Nou.\n\nBarca would lift the Champions League that year after Juliano Belletti scored a late winner at the Stade de France against Arsenal.\n\nMessi later recalled a 2012 Champions League defeat to Chelsea as being one of his biggest regrets in a Barcelona shirt.\n\n“I would have liked to have tried to win another Champions League,\" he said in 2021, when he announced his decision to leave Barca.\n\n“We got knocked out in the semi-final's by Liverpool which stopped us getting to another final. We got to the semi-final with Chelsea with Pep [Guardiola], they prevented us from getting to another final.",

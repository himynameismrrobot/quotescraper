      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho given his nationality and success in Portugal, but the new Manchester United boss was keen to play down comparisons when he met the British media on Friday.\n    Mourinho spent two-and-a-half-years at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League following his appointment in 2016. He also sent compatriot Amorim a message to congratulate him on his appointment as successor to Erik ten Hag at United.\n    \"I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto. \"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere. It's not the same thing. I'm different to Mourinho. He was European champion, I am not.\n    \"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n    \\n    \"Their young guys were [Frank] Lampard and these kind of players. Nowadays it's so much different. I think I'm the right person for now.\"\n    Amorim's arrival as Manchester United head coach is expected to see tactical changes, including a switch to three at the back. But which players are set to benefit most? United fan Adam McKola tells The Football News Show why he feels Amorim sticking to his style of football can bring the best out of the likes of Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.\n    Manchester United coach Darren Fletcher has been successful in reducing his touchline ban to two matches after being found guilty of misconduct against Brentford on Saturday 19 October.\n    Fletcher is alleged to have acted in an \"improper and/or confrontational manner\" and used \"abusive and/or insulting words\" towards the match officials during the Premier League victory at Old Trafford.\n    The former midfielder admitted to this misconduct, but argued that it was only towards the fourth official and the referee and that he was not abusive.\n    New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.\n    The 39-year-old said: \"I’m a little bit of a dreamer. I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n    \"You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\"\n    The former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.\n    Asked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing.\n    \"I don’t know about repair.\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play.\n    \"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try and win the title.\"\n    \"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\n    Amorim takes charge of United for the first time on Sunday, at Ipswich Town (16:30 GMT).",

      "article_text": "Mason Mount has yet to properly ignite in Manchester United colours, but the former Chelsea star may just have been given the biggest signal yet that his time is coming. \n\nThe fit-again midfielder was signed by Erik ten Hag last summer and, initially, it was hoped that he could step into their engine room alongside Casemiro and strike-up a winning combination. However, the plan never really caught fire and Ten Hag abandoned Mount as a double pivot option amid form and fitness concerns.\n\nIt was hardly surprising, either. Mount, now 25, enjoyed his best days at Chelsea further forward in their No.10 role or while operating on the flanks. He was road-blocked by Bruno Fernandes in his main position under Ten Hag, and the Dutchman's penchant for inverted forwards made it difficult for him out wide, too.\n\nUnited, for all their issues within the squad, are blessed with right-footed left wingers, so much so that they were able to cast off Jadon Sancho - to Chelsea, incidentally - leaving Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to 'fight' it out for the left-hand side with the other one regularly 'sacrificed' and made to settle for a spot on the right.\n\nMount would have taken that opportunity, no questions asked, but in any case it always felt as though he would be a fill-in player under Ten Hag and in his preferred system. Now that Ruben Amorim has stepped in, though, with that comes added incentive for Mount to really become part of the jigsaw.\n\n\"Mason Mount... I have to tell you I love that kid,\" Amorim said to club media before his first match. \n\nA good start, then, and it's clear to see Mount has made a positive first impression with the new head coach. \"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad,\" added Amorim. \"And this is the most important thing for me.  \n\n\"I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he's trying to stay fit, and we hope he can continue to be fit to show all the talent that he's shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"\n\nIn a glowing reference for his No.7, the now-former Sporting CP head coach - who is expected to deploy a fresh 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford and beyond - concluded: \"He played in this system before, so it's perfect for him.\n\n\"I have two positions for Mason Mount. So he should be very happy!\"\n\nHe should be very happy, indeed. By the end of the Ten Hag reign, he didn't even have one - even though United's ex-manager did believe in Mount enough to insist he wore the club's iconic No.7 shirt.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United have a series of injury issues to deal with against Ipswich Town. Ruben Amorim has a task ahead of him to turn things around at Manchester United but despite the lowly league table position he inherits, there is a sense of optimism at Old Trafford. After two weeks of settling in during the international break, it is now time for business. Not only does Amorim have the challenge of reinvigorating a squad which has underperformed for some time, he is expected to do it via a significant tactical switch to a back three. It is something which will pose new questions of the United players, who have seen their suitability for a formation change analysed aplently since Amorim's arrival was confirmed.\n\nTo complicate things further ahead of the trip to Ipswich Town on Sunday, Kieran McKenna's side are sure to be not only fired up with the chance to cause a shock, but also full of confidence after beating Tottenham just over 14 days ago. Matters are made even tougher when considering that Amorim won't have a full quota of options available.\n\nAs has been the case for much of the past 18 months, United continue to be plagued by injury. It is not an ideal scenario for Amorim to walk into. For starters, at least four players are expected to be absent for the game. Although there is a chance that Kobbie Mainoo returns - he trained ahead of the trip to Portman Road having been out for over a month with a thigh injury - Luke Shaw is still likely to be out. He hasn't played since February for United but is another who has found himself on the grass at Carrington as well.\n\nShaw is a natural fit for the left wing-back spot in Amorim's preferred 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 system but hasn't been fit for regular football in over two years. The same is true of Tyrell Malacia, who did play against Huddersfield Town for the Under-21 side and featured in training under Amorim this week. It may well still be too soon for him to be making senior matches just yet, though. Leny Yoro is in a similar camp. He is taking steps to make a United debut sooner rather than later but may well also go to the academy sides first as well. It is the curse of the backline, too, with Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez both doubts.\n\nMaguire has been working on his rehabilitation for almost six weeks now without much indication of being back in the fold. Meanwhile, Martinez surprised Argentina boss Lionel after withdrawing from the squad with a back problem.\n\nFellow centre-back Victor Lindelof is another struggling. He was dealt a blow during the break whilst playing for Sweden and appears unlikely to be able to return. Dan Gore is back in training, fortunately, but is not yet ready to be selected, it is understood. He is first expected to play for the Under-21s in the Premier League 2 next week. Tom Collyer is also out on the grass having been out since the start of the month.\n\nThe good news for United is that Malacia, Mainoo, and Yoro are all making progress at a vital stage early on under Amorim but there are doubts over if they are ready to try and help the team beat Ipswich on Sunday. In total it could be as many as nine players out. An optimist could suggest that Mainoo, Shaw, and perhaps Yoro are closing in on at least being able to make the bench.",

      "article_text": "Sporting Clube de Portugal star Ousmane Diomande has reportedly spoken to Ruben Amorim about the possibility of joining Manchester United.\n\nThat's according to Sky in Switzerland who claim the 20-year-old is 'growing increasingly keen' on the potential prospect of reuniting with Amorim at Old Trafford. Diomande has quickly earned the reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Portugal since joining Sporting in 2023.\n\nThe report also mentions he is set to be 'one of the attractions' for the next two transfer windows as United, Manchester City and Arsenal are claimed to be 'battling' for his signature. City, however, are thought to have had Diomande 'firmly' on their radar since his days at former club Midtjylland.\n\nMeanwhile, City's incoming director of football Hugo Viana is thought to have 'already prepared' a plan to convince Sporting president Frederico Varandas over parting ways with the Ivory Coast international. That's where Amorim comes in, with the report stating the Portuguese boss has already spoken to the centre-back.\n\nIt's claimed the player is aware that continuing his development under Amorim 'would be beneficial' and is reportedly 'leaning towards' a move to United. Diomande is reported to have a £66million (€80m) release clause in his contract which expires in the summer of 2027.\n\nElsewhere, Real Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.",

      "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
      "article_text": "Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?\n\n1\nDewsbury-Hall back on familiar ground\nAfter masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.\n\n2\nO’Riley can be pivotal to Brighton\nMatt O’Riley endured a tough start to his Brighton career when he suffered an ankle injury caused by a poor challenge nine minutes into his debut in the Carabao Cup against Crawley. The midfielder missed the following three months but showed his worth on his return to help transform the game against Manchester City and score the winner. Fabian Hürzeler and Brighton earmarked O’Riley as the man required in midfield to sit alongside Carlos Baleba, who has been struggling with a knee problem, and they could be paired from the start at Bournemouth. Brighton have not missed O’Riley much, starting the weekend in sixth. Baleba is 20 and O’Riley 24, meaning they could be a long-term partnership. That is not often the way at Brighton but if they perform as hoped the pair could provide the foundation for another push for European football while increasing their value.\n\n3\nCan Forest repeat Anfield heist?\nArsenal have picked up two points from 12 available over the past four games and are in a tricky spot. The prospect of facing the side immediately below them, who are yet to lose away all season, is a daunting one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have defeated Liverpool this season, proving they have the cunning and quality to topple title contenders. At Anfield, Forest’s success came about by packing the midfield and stopping Liverpool from playing with fluidity. It would seem Nuno might do similar to prevent Martin Ødegaard from pulling the strings. Forest’s manager has proven his intelligence when it comes to stifling opponents, while possessing a potent attacking threat. After losing to Newcastle, Nuno will want a reaction from his players. If he can get it to resemble the performance at Anfield he could be managing a top-four team by Saturday evening.\n\n4\nWill Villa’s miserable month continue?\nA winless month and four consecutive defeats across all competitions have taken the wind out of Aston Villa’s sails. Such patterns are not unknown for Unai Emery; his teams can blow hot and cold. That grim run has betrayed the fatigue of coming so far so fast and suggested that opposition managers may be cracking the Villa code. Emery’s high-risk football, when it falters, can often look one-dimensional as Villa did in successive chastening defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. With Ollie Watkins making an international breakthrough, and Morgan Rogers getting his first cap, Emery will hope for a lift in morale. Oliver Glasner, with fewer resources at Crystal Palace than Emery, has hit on similar problems, having initially been so successful last season. It still comes as a surprise to see Palace in the bottom three. Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton recovering fitness and form could be key for the Austrian manager.\n\n5\nEverton need to freshen up their game\nThis could be the final home game of the dreadful Farhad Moshiri era for Everton, with the Friedkin Group hoping that Premier League approval on their proposed takeover is close. A fresh start awaits – hopefully, as the club is in desperate need of one – and the same applies to Sean Dyche’s approach. He has made the team hard to beat but increasingly hard to watch; Everton are without a goal in their last two games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored in his last seven starts yet continues to keep Beto on the bench despite the Guinea-Bissau international offering the team a rare goal threat as a substitute. Calvert-Lewin could, in fairness, point to a desperate lack of quality service. Change is required, either at centre-forward or in the supply line, and while Brentford have lost all five league away games this season it must be noted those defeats have come at Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and to two goals in stoppage time at Fulham.\n\n6\nBerge helps fill Fulham’s Palhinha void\nIt would not have been a surprise if Fulham had dropped off after selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich. To their credit, though, they have managed to absorb the loss of the tough-tackling Portugal midfielder. Sasa Lukic, the Serbia international, caught the eye at the start of the season and Sander Berge has done well since breaking into the starting lineup last month. Berge was a canny buy. The Norwegian joined Sheffield United for £22m in 2020 and was relegated 18 months later. He was influential in the Championship, won promotion, joined Burnley and was relegated again last season. Fulham could give the 26-year-old stability. Berge will hope to make his sixth consecutive start when Marco Silva’s high-flying side host Wolves.\n\n7\nPep stays on but City must improve\nWhen does a feelgood vibe remain at a club despite a dismal four-game losing streak? Answer: when Manchester City and their all-time great manager, Pep Guardiola, have just agreed a new one-year deal. City look to arrest their slide against Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou’s off-the-cuff attacking unit will suit City. A side mocked as “Doctor Tottenham” – the joke being they provide the cure for a needy side’s ills – have the pace to get in behind the champions’ high line and damage them, too. A fifth consecutive reverse would cast the champions in crisis and have some (misguided) fans questioning the prudency of the Guardiola extension.\n\n8\nBottom meets top on south coast\nThere is already a 24-point gap between bottom and top as Southampton prepare to face Liverpool. Trying to find hope for Russell Martin’s side going into this fixture is tricky. At Wolves they failed to have a shot on target despite having 72% possession and they will not dominate the ball in the same manner on Sunday. Southampton’s style is about passing and patient buildup and it is unlikely Martin will ever change, even if the club’s Premier League status and his employment are at risk. All teams need an element of surprise, whether they are first or last, in order to keep opponents guessing, but Southampton’s predictability is their downfall and explains why they are bottom. Reacting when something is not working is a sign of a good coach. If Martin can bring himself to be more direct with the speed of his wingers and strikers, they could spring a much-needed upset.\n\n9\nHøjlund to fill Gyökeres role for Amorim?\nAmid all the fanfare surrounding Rúben Amorim, the key question is whether he will implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation and what personnel he could use to do so. At Sporting, Amorim was highly reliant on the quality of Viktor Gyökeres as his lone striker and will almost certainly give that role to Rasmus Højlund on Sunday as the only suitable player in the squad. The Danish international has shown his potential in flashes at United but needs to become more consistent. Højlund needs help in achieving this but he has some similar characteristics to Gyökeres. The Swede was not the finished article when he left Coventry for Sporting but is now one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, partly thanks to Amorim’s support. Quick and strong, Højlund has a similar profile but two goals in 12 appearances this season is not good enough to keep him in the starting lineup in the long term. Amorim might be just the man to help him.\n\n10\nLopetegui is on the brink\nMight this be Julen Lopetegui’s last stand? West Ham’s beleaguered manager could probably do without facing an improving Newcastle team fresh from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. England’s Jarrod Bowen will hope to impress in the north-east and ranks high on Eddie Howe’s January shopping list. The number of future visits West Ham might make to St James’ Park is currently a sensitive issue; while most Newcastle fans have indicated a preference for the club remaining at the stadium, the club’s Saudi ownership are currently exploring the idea of building a brand new ground, possibly four miles outside the city centre near the Gosforth Park racecourse. A decision is expected to be announced early in the New Year. Who knows where Lopetegui, or West Ham, will be by then.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues about the future, so I expect to hear today or tomorrow.”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has often been compared to Jose Mourinho given his nationality and success in Portugal, but the new Manchester United boss was keen to play down comparisons when he met the British media on Friday.\n    Mourinho spent two-and-a-half-years at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League following his appointment in 2016. He also sent compatriot Amorim a message to congratulate him on his appointment as successor to Erik ten Hag at United.\n    \"I remember that time,\" said Amorim, referring to when Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto. \"You looked at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere. It's not the same thing. I'm different to Mourinho. He was European champion, I am not.\n    \"Football is different nowadays, I think I am the right person for this moment. I am a young guy and I try to use this to help my players.\n    \\n    \"Their young guys were [Frank] Lampard and these kind of players. Nowadays it's so much different. I think I'm the right person for now.\"\n    Amorim's arrival as Manchester United head coach is expected to see tactical changes, including a switch to three at the back. But which players are set to benefit most? United fan Adam McKola tells The Football News Show why he feels Amorim sticking to his style of football can bring the best out of the likes of Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro.\n    Manchester United coach Darren Fletcher has been successful in reducing his touchline ban to two matches after being found guilty of misconduct against Brentford on Saturday 19 October.\n    Fletcher is alleged to have acted in an \"improper and/or confrontational manner\" and used \"abusive and/or insulting words\" towards the match officials during the Premier League victory at Old Trafford.\n    The former midfielder admitted to this misconduct, but argued that it was only towards the fourth official and the referee and that he was not abusive.\n    New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.\n    The 39-year-old said: \"I’m a little bit of a dreamer. I believe in myself. I believe in the club - we have the same mindset. I truly believe in the players. I know you don’t believe a lot but I do. I want to try new things.\n    \"You guys don’t think it’s possible, I do.\"\n    The former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.\n    Asked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing.\n    \"I don’t know about repair.\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play.\n    \"We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league, we have to improve a lot to try and win the title.\"\n    \"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\n    Amorim takes charge of United for the first time on Sunday, at Ipswich Town (16:30 GMT).",

        "article_text": "Mason Mount has yet to properly ignite in Manchester United colours, but the former Chelsea star may just have been given the biggest signal yet that his time is coming. \n\nThe fit-again midfielder was signed by Erik ten Hag last summer and, initially, it was hoped that he could step into their engine room alongside Casemiro and strike-up a winning combination. However, the plan never really caught fire and Ten Hag abandoned Mount as a double pivot option amid form and fitness concerns.\n\nIt was hardly surprising, either. Mount, now 25, enjoyed his best days at Chelsea further forward in their No.10 role or while operating on the flanks. He was road-blocked by Bruno Fernandes in his main position under Ten Hag, and the Dutchman's penchant for inverted forwards made it difficult for him out wide, too.\n\nUnited, for all their issues within the squad, are blessed with right-footed left wingers, so much so that they were able to cast off Jadon Sancho - to Chelsea, incidentally - leaving Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to 'fight' it out for the left-hand side with the other one regularly 'sacrificed' and made to settle for a spot on the right.\n\nMount would have taken that opportunity, no questions asked, but in any case it always felt as though he would be a fill-in player under Ten Hag and in his preferred system. Now that Ruben Amorim has stepped in, though, with that comes added incentive for Mount to really become part of the jigsaw.\n\n\"Mason Mount... I have to tell you I love that kid,\" Amorim said to club media before his first match. \n\nA good start, then, and it's clear to see Mount has made a positive first impression with the new head coach. \"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad,\" added Amorim. \"And this is the most important thing for me.  \n\n\"I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he's trying to stay fit, and we hope he can continue to be fit to show all the talent that he's shown, for example, in Chelsea.\"\n\nIn a glowing reference for his No.7, the now-former Sporting CP head coach - who is expected to deploy a fresh 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford and beyond - concluded: \"He played in this system before, so it's perfect for him.\n\n\"I have two positions for Mason Mount. So he should be very happy!\"\n\nHe should be very happy, indeed. By the end of the Ten Hag reign, he didn't even have one - even though United's ex-manager did believe in Mount enough to insist he wore the club's iconic No.7 shirt.",

        "headline": "Man United guaranteed to be without seven stars vs Ipswich as Ruben Amorim blow confirmed",
        "article_text": "Manchester United have a series of injury issues to deal with against Ipswich Town. Ruben Amorim has a task ahead of him to turn things around at Manchester United but despite the lowly league table position he inherits, there is a sense of optimism at Old Trafford. After two weeks of settling in during the international break, it is now time for business. Not only does Amorim have the challenge of reinvigorating a squad which has underperformed for some time, he is expected to do it via a significant tactical switch to a back three. It is something which will pose new questions of the United players, who have seen their suitability for a formation change analysed aplently since Amorim's arrival was confirmed.\n\nTo complicate things further ahead of the trip to Ipswich Town on Sunday, Kieran McKenna's side are sure to be not only fired up with the chance to cause a shock, but also full of confidence after beating Tottenham just over 14 days ago. Matters are made even tougher when considering that Amorim won't have a full quota of options available.\n\nAs has been the case for much of the past 18 months, United continue to be plagued by injury. It is not an ideal scenario for Amorim to walk into. For starters, at least four players are expected to be absent for the game. Although there is a chance that Kobbie Mainoo returns - he trained ahead of the trip to Portman Road having been out for over a month with a thigh injury - Luke Shaw is still likely to be out. He hasn't played since February for United but is another who has found himself on the grass at Carrington as well.\n\nShaw is a natural fit for the left wing-back spot in Amorim's preferred 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 system but hasn't been fit for regular football in over two years. The same is true of Tyrell Malacia, who did play against Huddersfield Town for the Under-21 side and featured in training under Amorim this week. It may well still be too soon for him to be making senior matches just yet, though. Leny Yoro is in a similar camp. He is taking steps to make a United debut sooner rather than later but may well also go to the academy sides first as well. It is the curse of the backline, too, with Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez both doubts.\n\nMaguire has been working on his rehabilitation for almost six weeks now without much indication of being back in the fold. Meanwhile, Martinez surprised Argentina boss Lionel after withdrawing from the squad with a back problem.\n\nFellow centre-back Victor Lindelof is another struggling. He was dealt a blow during the break whilst playing for Sweden and appears unlikely to be able to return. Dan Gore is back in training, fortunately, but is not yet ready to be selected, it is understood. He is first expected to play for the Under-21s in the Premier League 2 next week. Tom Collyer is also out on the grass having been out since the start of the month.\n\nThe good news for United is that Malacia, Mainoo, and Yoro are all making progress at a vital stage early on under Amorim but there are doubts over if they are ready to try and help the team beat Ipswich on Sunday. In total it could be as many as nine players out. An optimist could suggest that Mainoo, Shaw, and perhaps Yoro are closing in on at least being able to make the bench.",

Diomande has quickly earned the reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Portugal since joining Sporting in 2023.\n\nThe report also mentions he is set to be 'one of the attractions' for the next two transfer windows as United, Manchester City and Arsenal are claimed to be 'battling' for his signature. City, however, are thought to have had Diomande 'firmly' on their radar since his days at former club Midtjylland.\n\nMeanwhile, City's incoming director of football Hugo Viana is thought to have 'already prepared' a plan to convince Sporting president Frederico Varandas over parting ways with the Ivory Coast international. That's where Amorim comes in, with the report stating the Portuguese boss has already spoken to the centre-back.\n\nIt's claimed the player is aware that continuing his development under Amorim 'would be beneficial' and is reportedly 'leaning towards' a move to United. Diomande is reported to have a £66million (€80m) release clause in his contract which expires in the summer of 2027.\n\nElsewhere, Real Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.",

        "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
        "article_text": "Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?\n\n1\nDewsbury-Hall back on familiar ground\nAfter masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.\n\n2\nO’Riley can be pivotal to Brighton\nMatt O’Riley endured a tough start to his Brighton career when he suffered an ankle injury caused by a poor challenge nine minutes into his debut in the Carabao Cup against Crawley. The midfielder missed the following three months but showed his worth on his return to help transform the game against Manchester City and score the winner. Fabian Hürzeler and Brighton earmarked O’Riley as the man required in midfield to sit alongside Carlos Baleba, who has been struggling with a knee problem, and they could be paired from the start at Bournemouth. Brighton have not missed O’Riley much, starting the weekend in sixth. Baleba is 20 and O’Riley 24, meaning they could be a long-term partnership. That is not often the way at Brighton but if they perform as hoped the pair could provide the foundation for another push for European football while increasing their value.\n\n3\nCan Forest repeat Anfield heist?\nArsenal have picked up two points from 12 available over the past four games and are in a tricky spot. The prospect of facing the side immediately below them, who are yet to lose away all season, is a daunting one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have defeated Liverpool this season, proving they have the cunning and quality to topple title contenders. At Anfield, Forest’s success came about by packing the midfield and stopping Liverpool from playing with fluidity. It would seem Nuno might do similar to prevent Martin Ødegaard from pulling the strings. Forest’s manager has proven his intelligence when it comes to stifling opponents, while possessing a potent attacking threat. After losing to Newcastle, Nuno will want a reaction from his players. If he can get it to resemble the performance at Anfield he could be managing a top-four team by Saturday evening.\n\n4\nWill Villa’s miserable month continue?\nA winless month and four consecutive defeats across all competitions have taken the wind out of Aston Villa’s sails. Such patterns are not unknown for Unai Emery; his teams can blow hot and cold. That grim run has betrayed the fatigue of coming so far so fast and suggested that opposition managers may be cracking the Villa code. Emery’s high-risk football, when it falters, can often look one-dimensional as Villa did in successive chastening defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. With Ollie Watkins making an international breakthrough, and Morgan Rogers getting his first cap, Emery will hope for a lift in morale. Oliver Glasner, with fewer resources at Crystal Palace than Emery, has hit on similar problems, having initially been so successful last season. It still comes as a surprise to see Palace in the bottom three. Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton recovering fitness and form could be key for the Austrian manager.\n\n5\nEverton need to freshen up their game\nThis could be the final home game of the dreadful Farhad Moshiri era for Everton, with the Friedkin Group hoping that Premier League approval on their proposed takeover is close. A fresh start awaits – hopefully, as the club is in desperate need of one – and the same applies to Sean Dyche’s approach. He has made the team hard to beat but increasingly hard to watch; Everton are without a goal in their last two games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored in his last seven starts yet continues to keep Beto on the bench despite the Guinea-Bissau international offering the team a rare goal threat as a substitute. Calvert-Lewin could, in fairness, point to a desperate lack of quality service. Change is required, either at centre-forward or in the supply line, and while Brentford have lost all five league away games this season it must be noted those defeats have come at Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and to two goals in stoppage time at Fulham.\n\n6\nBerge helps fill Fulham’s Palhinha void\nIt would not have been a surprise if Fulham had dropped off after selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich. To their credit, though, they have managed to absorb the loss of the tough-tackling Portugal midfielder. Sasa Lukic, the Serbia international, caught the eye at the start of the season and Sander Berge has done well since breaking into the starting lineup last month. Berge was a canny buy. The Norwegian joined Sheffield United for £22m in 2020 and was relegated 18 months later. He was influential in the Championship, won promotion, joined Burnley and was relegated again last season. Fulham could give the 26-year-old stability. Berge will hope to make his sixth consecutive start when Marco Silva’s high-flying side host Wolves.\n\n7\nPep stays on but City must improve\nWhen does a feelgood vibe remain at a club despite a dismal four-game losing streak? Answer: when Manchester City and their all-time great manager, Pep Guardiola, have just agreed a new one-year deal. City look to arrest their slide against Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou’s off-the-cuff attacking unit will suit City. A side mocked as “Doctor Tottenham” – the joke being they provide the cure for a needy side’s ills – have the pace to get in behind the champions’ high line and damage them, too. A fifth consecutive reverse would cast the champions in crisis and have some (misguided) fans questioning the prudency of the Guardiola extension.\n\n8\nBottom meets top on south coast\nThere is already a 24-point gap between bottom and top as Southampton prepare to face Liverpool. Trying to find hope for Russell Martin’s side going into this fixture is tricky. At Wolves they failed to have a shot on target despite having 72% possession and they will not dominate the ball in the same manner on Sunday. Southampton’s style is about passing and patient buildup and it is unlikely Martin will ever change, even if the club’s Premier League status and his employment are at risk. All teams need an element of surprise, whether they are first or last, in order to keep opponents guessing, but Southampton’s predictability is their downfall and explains why they are bottom. Reacting when something is not working is a sign of a good coach. If Martin can bring himself to be more direct with the speed of his wingers and strikers, they could spring a much-needed upset.\n\n9\nHøjlund to fill Gyökeres role for Amorim?\nAmid all the fanfare surrounding Rúben Amorim, the key question is whether he will implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation and what personnel he could use to do so. At Sporting, Amorim was highly reliant on the quality of Viktor Gyökeres as his lone striker and will almost certainly give that role to Rasmus Højlund on Sunday as the only suitable player in the squad. The Danish international has shown his potential in flashes at United but needs to become more consistent. Højlund needs help in achieving this but he has some similar characteristics to Gyökeres. The Swede was not the finished article when he left Coventry for Sporting but is now one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, partly thanks to Amorim’s support. Quick and strong, Højlund has a similar profile but two goals in 12 appearances this season is not good enough to keep him in the starting lineup in the long term. Amorim might be just the man to help him.\n\n10\nLopetegui is on the brink\nMight this be Julen Lopetegui’s last stand? West Ham’s beleaguered manager could probably do without facing an improving Newcastle team fresh from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. England’s Jarrod Bowen will hope to impress in the north-east and ranks high on Eddie Howe’s January shopping list. The number of future visits West Ham might make to St James’ Park is currently a sensitive issue; while most Newcastle fans have indicated a preference for the club remaining at the stadium, the club’s Saudi ownership are currently exploring the idea of building a brand new ground, possibly four miles outside the city centre near the Gosforth Park racecourse. A decision is expected to be announced early in the New Year. Who knows where Lopetegui, or West Ham, will be by then.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim yet to be granted visa despite starting Manchester United job on Monday",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues about the future, so I expect to hear today or tomorrow.”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”",

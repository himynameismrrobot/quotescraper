Ipswich Town got their first Premier League win of the season before the international break while new Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is gearing up for his first game at the helm.\n    \n    That sets up an intriguing battle at Portman Road on Sunday.\n    \n    But, while they go head to head on the pitch, we have asked our fan writers for each club to go head to head off it.\n    \n    Each fan got to ask three questions of the other before the big game...\n    \n\n3.  **Steve Mellen**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    _Here is what our Ipswich Town fan writer Steve Mellen had to say in response to questions from our Manchester United contributor Dale O'Donnell._\n    \n    **How important is Kieran McKenna to Ipswich Town?**\n    \n    He is the key to the success of the past two seasons and getting him to sign a new deal was the most important event in our summer.\n    \n    We get nervous every time a Premier League club sacks their manager. He is brilliant.\n    \n    **Ipswich's last league win over United came in 1994. Can the Tractor Boys ruin Ruben Amorim's first game in charge?**\n    \n    Confidence is high after the past two performances. I am slightly wary of calling a win, as you assume the United players will want to impress their new boss.\n    \n    I think as it is at Portman Road we can get a point, but we expect United to be up for it and to present a huge challenge.\n    \n    **Are you confident Ipswich will avoid relegation?**\n    \n    Hopeful rather than confident.\n    \n    We seem to be finding our feet, as the win at Spurs shows, but the odds are against us as a team that was in League One in recent memory.\n    \n    We will fight to the end and will not be daunted by any challenge, and McKenna's ability to improve players and maintain team spirit will be key.\n    \n    _Steve Mellen is the former editor of ITFC magazine Meet Me At Sir Alf, and also represented fanzine Those Were The Days_\n    \n4.  **Dale O'Donnell**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    _Here is what our Manchester United fan writer Dale O'Donnell had to say in response to questions from our Ipswich Town contributor Steve Mellen._\n    \n    **What are the expectations this season now Ruben Amorim is in post?**\n    \n    Amorim will be tasked with delivering on several fronts, but United fans are desperate to see an attractive playing style that showcases a sense of identity.\n    \n    We did not know which United would show up from one week to another under Erik ten Hag, and he lost his job for not winning enough football matches.\n    \n    **What was the biggest issue for you under Ten Hag?**\n    \n    The biggest issue in my eyes was how Ten Hag came from a successful Ajax side that played great football, and when he was unable to implement that system at United, he tried to make us a transitional team heavily reliant on the counter-attack.\n    \n    The Dutchman may be a shrewd tactician but he watched his midfield regularly get overrun.\n    \n    **With Oasis reforming do you wish it was the early '90s again with Fergie at the helm and United churning out great teams from their own youth system?**\n    \n    No, because I enjoy reminiscing about those times.\n    \n    The Class of '92 is not something any other English club has been able to replicate and can only be compared to the Busby Babes of the 1950s and 1960s. Our academy still produces the best young players in the country, as seen with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.\n    \n    As for Oasis, I hope their reformation means [Manchester City](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) go back to being rubbish.\n    \n    _Find more from Dale O'Donnell at_ [_Stretty News_, external](https://strettynews.com/)\n    \n5.

The work that we do in our local communities is central to us.\"\n    \n6.  \n\n8.

I've come in and the rhythm and form has picked up. I feel like I am fully settled now.\n    \n    \"It's just about wanting to come here and be committed to this club. I really see a vision and see great things from the players and the staff. It's something I want to be a part of, just giving my all and playing for the team is important to me.\"\n    \n    **On Sunday's game against Manchester United, Johnson added:** \"It's going to be a great game, probably one of the most televised games this season because it's massive when United come to town. Their new manager is very good and is going to implement a lot of great stuff.\n    \n    \"We're playing at Portman Road. It can be intimidating at times but it's a great stadium and we love to play there. It's going to be a great game regardless of what happens. It's always a great feeling when you play against the biggest clubs in the world.\"\n    \n9.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Ipswich are the only side without a Premier League win at home this season (P5 D3 L2). Only five newly promoted sides have failed to win any of their opening six home matches of a campaign in the division, and all five went on to be relegated.\n    \n    The Tractor Boys have had the fewest shots (108), shots on target (33), touches in the opposition's box (199) and expected goals (10.2) of any side in the 2024-25 Premier League.\n    \n    Meanwhile, Liam Delap has scored six of Town's 12 league goals this season, making him one of only three players to have scored at least half of his side's goals in the competition this term, alongside Erling Haaland of [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) (12 of 22) and [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) striker Chris Wood (eight out of 15).\n    \n10.  BBC Sport pundit Nedum Onuoha gives us his insight and opinion every fortnight on your Premier League club.\n    \n    But this week, he's in the hotseat for your questions.\n    \n    So what do you want to ask for a former player. Best opponent? Most memorable team-mate he played with?\n    \n    Or maybe you're just interested in what next for your club this season?\n    \n    [Send in your questions, external](https://modules.wearehearken.eu/bbc-sport/embed/47275/share)\n    \n11.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    We asked for one thing - good or bad - involving Ipswich that nobody is talking about but should be.\n    \n    Here are some of your comments:\n    \n    **Peter:** Whatever happens this year, the future looks brighter with the decision to upgrade the academy to category one shortly. Some quality homegrown players in the first team in a few years' time will please every fan and help Town remain competitive with the richer clubs.\n    \n    **Gareth:** Ipswich have won or drawn more games than they have lost. Keep improving week by week and maybe more of those invaluable wins come.\n    \n    **Fernando:** Why Leif Davis isn't in the England squad.\n    \n    **Tom:** The narrative in the media has been this 'awful start' that Ipswich have had, however, the least concerned have been Town fans. Watching them week in, week out, we have all seen that the results haven't matched the performances (bar a couple). Yes, it took a sub-par performance from [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur), but it's no surprise that we were competitive against them.\n    \n12.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    There has been some pressure on players carrying an injury going into international breaks with their national side because you are contracted to these clubs and that is where your income is.\n    \n    But, for me, as a player I had a similar [mindset to Harry Kane](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp8x4rvne86o) that I would always be available - injured or not injured. I would have injections when I was on international duty just so I could represent my country because it meant that much.\n    \n    It is difficult, however. If you look at Jack Grealish and [Pep Guardiola's comments,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvgknzd9gqwo) he has a point because the forward has not been able to play for Manchester City because of injuries. So if you have been sidelined for three or four games, I would agree that you are then not fit and available to go on international duty.\n    \n    But when you look at some of the other players, ones who have been playing and being managed by their club, then I do not see it being different to being played and managed by your country.\n    \n    From the club's side, when they are competing at such high levels in the Premier League, you can understand why they would want their players to be rested and get fully fit again over the two weeks, rather than having to come back straight into a hectic period of fixtures.\n    \n    I kind of get it from both points of view but, as a player, if I am half fit and being played by my club, I would be fully available for my national team.\n    \n    It is really difficult with the pressure that is on the players, though. I would not look at it as a decision players have made solely.\n    \n    _Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson_\n    \n13.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Out of the three promoted teams this season, Ipswich look like the most adaptable.\n    \n    Manager Kieran McKenna is able to identify what it is his team needs to change. We saw in the opening game against [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) that they were good and competed for a period of time before they ultimately lost that match.\n    \n    They are building and are slowly adapting. The players know they are Championship players that are growing within the league. It is credit to both the players and the manager at Ipswich that they are willing to adapt and find ways to see games through.\n    \n    They have had a lot of draws and games they perhaps should have won, but getting that first win and the manner in which they did it will be massive for them.\n    \n    Finding ways to win in the Premier League is difficult and they were able to do that in a game that myself and many others did not have them down to get anything from. That shows growth. As a manager, it showed McKenna was willing to adapt and in the top flight - that is important.\n    \n    This could become the blueprint now for their season. They have been close to getting a result like this but had not been able to see games out, so when you get that first win it relieves that bit of pressure.\n    \n    Ipswich will know they are going to be in a dogfight until the end of the season, but the player-manager relationship looks really good from the outside while the fans are on board and have been fantastic.\n    \n    Everybody in the club is connected and on the same page. That really does help.\n    \n    _Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson_\n    \n14.  Kieran McKenna's side claimed their first Premier League victory of the season away at [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) Stadium last weekend, after showing steady signs of progress in their first 10 league matches.\n    \n    The club has also submitted plans to expand its Playford Road training centre this week, which would include the creation of a \"state-of-the-art\" first-team building.\n    \n    But what is the one thing - good or bad - nobody is talking about in relation to Ipswich?\n    \n    [Let us know here, external](https://modules.wearehearken.eu/bbc-sport/embed/44075/share)\n    \n15.  Image source, PA Media\n    \n    On the latest episode of [Planet Premier League on BBC Sounds,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0k4d1k5) Wales captain Aaron Ramsey and former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha praised Ipswich Town after they achieved their first league win of the season at [Tottenham](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) on Sunday.\n    \n    Ramsey, who played for [Cardiff City](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/cardiff-city) against Ipswich in the Championship last season, said: \"They were a breath of fresh air really, to do back-to-back promotions. Everyone was saying the wheels were going to fall off at some point, but they were just relentless.\n    \n    \"I love the belief they have in their squad. They scored so many late goals in that season last year and even when they were 2-0 or 2-1 down, they managed to get a result or go on and win the game, which is so important to have that sort of mentality.\n    \n    \"I think he \\[Kieran McKenna\\] has done a tremendous job there and now they're just starting to find their feet and they are putting in some good performances now. I'm sure that will continue and they will pick up results now, which will go a long way as the season goes on.\"\n    \n    Having taken a 2-0 lead, Ipswich held off a late Spurs rally to secure their first Premier League victory for 22 years.\n    \n    \"That's part of their maturity in this division because a lot of these players are doing it for the first time,\" added Onuoha.\n    \n    \"We're seeing players like Liam Delap get headlines for the goals he's scoring - and they should be spoken about - but if they want to stay up, it's got to be about the collective.\"\n    \n16.  \n17.  **Henry Brownsey**  \n    BBC Sport journalist\n    \n    There were plenty of memorable numbers across the weekend's Premier League football...\n    \n    1 - How many games it took Brighton's Matt O'Riley to open his account in the top flight.\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    250 - How many appearances Bruno Fernandes has now made for Manchester United, registering a combined 155 goals and assists in this time.\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    4 - Consecutive defeats for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side, and the first time he has had such a losing run in his managerial career.\n    \n    28 - Points Liverpool boss Arne Slot has earned in the Premier League in his first 11 games in charge - the joint-most of any new manager.\n    \n    80 - Seconds between Bournemouth going 2-1 up and Mikkel Damsgaard equalising for Brentford.\n    \n    1:48 - How long into the game Pablo Sarabia put Wolves ahead against Southampton - becoming the club's earliest Premier League goalscorer.\n    \n    22 years, six months, two weeks and three days - The amount of time Ipswich Town had gone without a Premier League victory before Sunday's win at Tottenham.\n    \n18.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Ipswich Town legend George Burley says he is \"feeling well\" after his initial treatment for cancer.\n    \n    The former Scotland manager [issued a statement through his former club](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgl2r4k8zewo) in September to share the news of his diagnosis of an undisclosed form of the disease.\n    \n    In an interview with BBC Radio Suffolk, he said he had had chemotherapy and was awaiting details of the next stage of treatment, adding: \"It's one step at a time, but at the moment I’m feeling well.\"\n    \n    Burley said although it had been a \"difficult time\", he was trying to keep lively and fit as well as focussing on eating healthily.\n    \n    He had also been able to return to playing golf and had attended every Ipswich home game this season.\n    \n    The 68-year-old played for Ipswich from 1973 to 1985, making more than 500 appearances, before managing the side between 1994 and 2002 and was in charge the last time they were in the top flight.\n    \n    Burley said he had received support locally and from figures in the game, including text messages from some current Ipswich players and boss Kieran McKenna.\n    \n    He said he had also been heartened by the Tractor Boys' form, especially their 2-1 win at [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) at the weekend.\n    \n    \"Their performances have been excellent,\" Burley said.\n    \n    \"It's about making good performances and I haven't been panicking because the team have been playing really well and there's improvement every week.\n    \n    \"I've got every confidence that we get to stay in the Premier League this season.\"\n    \n    [Listen to the full interview from 38'20 on BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jzcbw4)\n    \n19.  \n20.  **Seb Brown**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    As the full-time whistle sounded at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the joy and elation from the away end released 22 years of hurt.\n    \n    The last time Ipswich Town won a game in the Premier League was in April 2002 at home to Middlesbrough.\n    \n    The journey the fans have been on since has had many more downs than ups, but Sunday's result was another tick on the long list of recent achievements to bring the club back to where many think it rightfully belongs.\n    \n    Following [Wolves'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/wolverhampton-wanderers) victory over [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) on Saturday, Ipswich found themselves with the unenviable record of being the only side in England's top four divisions to be without a win this season.\n    \n    With a daunting trip to Spurs, followed by an international break, even the most optimistic of Town fans would have thought the chances of a zero remaining in the win column until nearly December was almost certain.\n    \n    Sunday's victory was the latest example of how the team has continuously evolved this season when playing away.\n    \n    Two weeks previously, Town had also taken a 2-0 lead away from home, in London, in a stadium in which they had never played before. That game however was 2-2 by half-time, with [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) running out eventual 4-3 winners with a 96th-minute goal.\n    \n    Sunday had some parallels with the Brentford game but, crucially, some vital differences.\n    \n    This time Town were able to weather the storm in the immediate aftermath of half-time, when Spurs came out fired up. Even when Tottenham pulled a goal back, the concerns among the away fans were proven to be incorrect as the game was seen out relatively comfortably.\n    \n    Eight points from 11 games is a great return and, more crucially, we are up to 17th position.\n    \n    Bring on [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) in two weeks' time!\n    \n    _Find more from Seb Brown at the_ [_Blue Monday Podcast_, external](https://bluemondayitfc.co.uk/)"

      "article_text": "Southampton boss Russell Martin has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against Liverpool at St Mary's Stadium (kick-off 14:00 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\n*   Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale (finger) and defender Jan Bednarek (knee) will miss Sunday's game and be out for \"a number of weeks\". Alex McCarthy will deputise for Ramsdale and Martin has \"so much trust\" in him to perform.\n*   Martin said everyone at Saints is \"immensely proud\" of Taylor Harwood-Bellis after the defender scored on his England debut last weekend: \"The aim when he came in last year in the Championship - and he was disappointed not to be in the Premier League at that point - was to get there together and give him the best chance of achieving his dream of international football.\"\n*   Martin said the club met with [refereeing body] PGMOL to discuss two contentious decisions in the defeat by Wolves before the international break. He said he \"still has issues\" with Ryan Manning's disallowed effort and a potential foul for Wolves' second goal, as well as the match review panel concluding the decisions made were correct.\n*   But he added: \"It's happened - it is what it is. [Howard Webb] accepted a lot of our points and we had to accept a lot of his, because it's not easy. But I think it was important for us to have a chat.\"\n*   On a busy spell of fixtures coming up: \"We showed the guys the table how it looked at this point last season, and how much it changed by the end of December. It's such an exciting month. People talk about the difficulty of the games and the level of competition we face in the next four or five games, but it's what we've worked so hard for and we should be excited about the challenge.\"\n*   He is therefore not intimidated by daunting games on the schedule: \"Teams have shown in recent weeks that you can pick up big results against big teams and good opposition. We're going to have to at some point if we're going to achieve what we want to achieve.\"\n*   The Southampton boss said Liverpool are \"the best team in the country at the moment on current form\" and on Arne Slot's start as boss, he added: \"When you go into a club that's built on something for so long with top players that have bought into that, he hasn't changed too much. It's the best management at that point to continue some of the brilliant things they were good at, and put his own spin on it, which he has done.\n\nTaylor Harwood-Bellis has said his attention has quickly returned to Southampton's position in the Premier League, following a goal on his senior England debut against Republic of Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nThe 22-year-old told BBC Radio Solent: \"I'm not too bad at changing focus. People have asked me about it at home and England is not something I want to talk about too much now.\n\n\"We've got a job to do in the league. Me scoring for England has not hidden the fact that we're bottom of the league and we've got a big game on Sunday [against Liverpool].\"\n\nHarwood-Bellis added that he has been on the wrong end of some light-hearted banter with his team-mates following his international exploits.\n\n\"They give me a bit of stick whenever I mention it - they set me up and then when I start, they hammer me for mentioning it,\" joked the former Manchester City centre-back.\n\nFormer Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy is keen to stay in the Premier League amid potential managerial opportunities at Southampton, Wolves and Crystal Palace.\n\nSouthampton, Brighton and Ipswich are considering a move for Vasco de Gama's Brazilian forward Rayan, 18, in January.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal are considering a move for Saints midfielder Shea Charles, who has impressed on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nSouthampton have registered an interest in 18-year-old Real Madrid and Brazil striker Endrick, alongside Roma and Real Valladolid."

Do you think this will be what’s needed to stay up by keeping things consistent, or will it lead us to a delusional relegation if things don’t change?\n    \n    **Nedum replied:** That is a great question. A sense of unity will always give you a chance, especially when people are all pulling in the same direction.

They are not in crisis.\n    \n    So, because of that, I don't think the team and staff are being delusional. Sometimes you just need belief because you know you have the quality and that might have come from their first win of the season over [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton).\n    \n    Harmony through disappointment is so important because it shows they are happy to work hard to break the situation they are in now.

Read Thursday's full gossip column](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cyv7298194jo)\n    \n4.  **Mike Taylor**  \n    BBC Radio WM reporter\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    When Raul Jimenez left Wolves, there was great mutual affection between him and the fans, and some sadness that his best days appeared to have been cut short in such an unfortunate way.\n    \n    He really had been a fine attacking leader in the best period of Wolves' recent history and was a popular, genial figure. It was hard for everyone, and no doubt hardest for Raul himself, that after all his struggles to recover from his dreadful head injury in November 2020, his peak form would not return.\n    \n    It was therefore greatly uplifting watching [Fulham's](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) recent game against [Aston Villa](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa), to find that the peak-Jimenez was back - rattling defenders, racing onto chances and, most of all, obviously relishing the contest. Those who cheered him in his Wolves days will be thrilled for him too, but this week are probably queasy at the idea he might prove to be a very challenging opponent on Saturday.\n    \n    Wolves took a long time to adequately replace him. There have been some failed auditions and some alternative approaches. Matheus Cunha has turned out to be a fine player, but not best as a number nine. Sasa Kalajdzic might have been the answer but suffered dreadful luck. Diego Costa was fun, but only ever passing through.\n    \n    At last, to some relief, Wolves signed Jorgen Strand Larsen last summer. Tall and strongly built, with a promising record and a similarly affable manner to Jimenez - he looks the part.\n    \n    It has not been an easy start in a struggling team - admittedly not one struggling to score goals. Larsen has plugged away willingly, although it has sometimes seemed like a lonely trudge, and he has often left the scene midway through the second half, visibly spent. Still, four goals is not a bad return in a team near the bottom, and his hard yards will have eased the physical pressure on others, perhaps Cunha most.\n    \n    This weekend's game at Fulham offers the chance of a direct comparison, although a slight distraction from the main story. The key issue from the first part of the season is that Wolves' leaky defence will sink them unless the holes are plugged.\n    \n    They held firm against [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) for a long-awaited clean sheet, despite - as Gary O'Neil explained - Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno labouring through with injuries. Patched up or not, if they can hold off the resurgent Jimenez and company this weekend, things may be looking up.\n    \n    [Listen to full commentary of Fulham v Wolves at 15:00 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM (96.6 FM)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_wm)\n    \n    Tune into [The West Midlands Football Phone-In](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p001g9px) from 18:00 on weeknights\n    \n5.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Only [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) (seven) and [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) (five) have scored more goals from outside the penalty area in the Premier League in 2024-25 than Wolves' three, while [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) have conceded more goals from outside the penalty area than any other side in this season's competition (five).\n    \n    Since the start of the 2023-24 campaign, only three players have been involved in a higher proportion of their side's Premier League goals than Wolves' Matheus Cunha (39% - 17 goals, nine assists). The forward has also netted in his past three away league games.\n    \n6.  **Dazzling Dave**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    In July, when Wolves acquired Jorgen Strand Larsen, sporting director Matt Hobbs expressed his ambition for the team to target the European competition spots.\n    \n    Fast forward to today, and Wolves find themselves far from realising that goal.\n    \n    Despite outscoring fifth-placed [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) this season, Wolves are anchored to the bottom of the table.\n    \n    Inconsistencies in defence have hindered Gary O'Neil's efforts to build a cohesive team. According to WhoScored, Wolves are the league's biggest under-performers for xG against - conceding 27 goals versus an expected 22.41, a discrepancy of 4.59.\n    \n    Their attack tells a different story, with Wolves scoring 16 goals compared to an expected 12.88 - surpassing expectations by 3.12 goals, the highest attacking over-performance in the division.\n    \n    At the heart of Wolves' attack is Matheus Cunha, a beacon of hope for O'Neil. Cunha has a remarkable ability to turn the mundane into the spectacular, having scored five goals and provided two assists so far this season.\n    \n    He has been instrumental in nearly half of Wolves' goals this season, but his impact goes beyond statistics.\n    \n    With 23 goal contributions in his last 28 Premier League starts, he stands among the elite and he is only surpassed in consistency by six players from top-six teams. His shot rate of 3.2 per 90 minutes even surpasses notable players like Mohamed Salah and Ollie Watkins.\n    \n    Without Cunha, Wolves' offence would lack potency and direction.\n    \n    We have to ask: is it O'Neil's tactical nous shaping results or the sheer talent of individuals like Cunha?\n    \n    O'Neil, once lauded for his tactical acumen on Monday Night Football, now faces a formidable test with Wolves.\n    \n    While his attacking unit shows promise, defensive frailties undermine their efforts. Vulnerabilities at set-pieces and open play offer openings that opponents readily exploit.\n    \n    Though Wolves possess the core of a solid mid-table team, defensive improvements are essential or O'Neil's tactics may prove ineffective.\n    \n    While the squad boasts many talented individuals, survival in the Premier League depends heavily on Cunha's continued performance. Any injury or transfer involving Cunha could significantly diminish Wolves' chances of retaining their league status.\n    \n    _Find more from Dazzling Dave at_ [_Always Wolves_, external](https://alwayswolves.co.uk/)\n    \n7.

Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    There has been some pressure on players carrying an injury going into international breaks with their national side because you are contracted to these clubs and that is where your income is.\n    \n    But, for me, as a player I had a similar [mindset to Harry Kane](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp8x4rvne86o) that I would always be available - injured or not injured. I would have injections when I was on international duty just so I could represent my country because it meant that much.\n    \n    It is difficult, however. If you look at Jack Grealish and [Pep Guardiola's comments,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvgknzd9gqwo) he has a point because the forward has not been able to play for Manchester City because of injuries. So if you have been sidelined for three or four games, I would agree that you are then not fit and available to go on international duty.\n    \n    But when you look at some of the other players, ones who have been playing and being managed by their club, then I do not see it being different to being played and managed by your country.\n    \n    From the club's side, when they are competing at such high levels in the Premier League, you can understand why they would want their players to be rested and get fully fit again over the two weeks, rather than having to come back straight into a hectic period of fixtures.\n    \n    I kind of get it from both points of view but, as a player, if I am half fit and being played by my club, I would be fully available for my national team.\n    \n    It is really difficult with the pressure that is on the players, though.

With Johnstone out injured, he returned to the line-up against [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on 20 October and made a string of fine saves in a 2-1 defeat.\n    \n    He has played in each of the past four games, but who Wolves' starting goalkeeper will be moving forward will likely be on the agenda again following fit-again Johnstone's return to the bench against Southampton.\n    \n13.  **Mike Taylor**  \n    BBC Radio WM reporter\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    \"I understand the crowd,\" said Wolves captain Mario Lemina on Saturday. \"But we know our manager.\"\n    \n    Results and the calendar appeared to be conspiring against Gary O'Neil. Failure to win the final game before the November break - the last until the spring - would have stress-tested Wolves' resolve to keep him, perhaps to breaking point.\n    \n    We will never know now, or not for a few weeks at least.\n    \n    The conditions for change were clear, but one factor so common to these situations was missing. Sometimes with struggling teams, suspicions that players have lost faith in the coach seem too obvious to ignore. Not always a lack of effort, but a sensed lack of conviction, and often there is one game when everything unravels.\n    \n    It has not happened. There have been plenty of faults to spot - especially defensively - but it has never appeared that the players have given up on their work, or on O'Neil. It has always felt as if they care.\n    \n    There has been despair and emotion from the players, but even at the darkest stage of the past few months, when they were being taken apart at [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford), Wolves still kept pushing enough to score the last goal of the game. They have shown the will, but not found the means.\n    \n    Not until Saturday, anyway.\n    \n    The early goal helped enormously, but soon afterwards, it was hard to claim that it had settled the nerves. After half-time, though, they adjusted and seemed settled. They certainly were after Matheus Cunha's fine shot.\n    \n    It had not all been enjoyable, but - in the circumstances of the day - once Wolves had scored, the only two words that mattered were \"[Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) nil\". Better performances will need to follow, but this game had to be won first, by any means.\n    \n    Lemina has faith and is happy to share it: \"We know our manager is doing everything. Sometimes it's not about him - it's just about what we do on the pitch. Today showed he was a good tactical manager.\"\n    \n    Nevertheless, there is a section of supporters, voluble in public channels even after Saturday, who still feel that this is the time to change, with winter in mind.\n    \n    The idea that Wolves are now into an easy spell, after their demanding start, is a fallacy with [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) next.

Mikel Arteta, Andoni Iraola, Enzo Maresca, Steve Cooper, Arne Slot, Kieran McKenna, Russell Martin and Ruben Amorim are all within five years of him either side, while Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler is a decade younger.\n    \n    Ultimately, he is among his peers.\n    \n    The adage \"it's the hope that kills you\" has taken on a new meaning: the higher-ups' high hopes for O'Neil feel like a punter who naively believes the \"free beer tomorrow\" sign chalked up behind the bar.\n    \n    And yet, despite unconvincing performances, results since [Brentford](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) have improved. Arguably, O’Neil has achieved only a point or two less than anyone could have in the four matches since.\n    \n    To survive long term, however, excuses must stop and philosophies must begin to show. Any side with a spine as strong as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Jorgen Strand Larsen, Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina and Santiago Bueno should not be languishing in the relegation zone and still without a distinct identity.\n    \n    From the shoots of that first win over [Southampton](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton), O'Neil must build this team in his image. How Wolves express themselves is a reflection of him: his beliefs, his ideologies, his principles.\n    \n    At the moment, that screams uncertainty. We look a side lacking conviction and confidence, riddled with fragility, fear and self-doubt, and on the brink of collapse.\n    \n    Tetchy. Much like our manager.\n    \n    The noise surrounding him is loud and the fanbase reactive (which can work both ways), but O’Neil's biggest challenge is undoubtedly - among the chaos - to find himself.\n    \n    Firefighting will not suffice.\n    \n    _Find more from George at_ [_Always Wolves_, external](https://alwayswolves.co.uk/)\n    \n16.

The three points were important, but the performance again was poor. With the quality of players we have, it is hard to argue against a better manager getting much more out of this squad.\n    \n    **Phil answered:** Time will tell on the long term but there is no doubt that was a huge result for O'Neil and Wolves. It was all about the win on Saturday - the substance, not the style.\n    \n    It is clear the club want to stick by him and admire him but a loss to Southampton at home would have ratcheted up the pressure, which is why it was portrayed in many quarters as a must-win game.\n    \n    In mitigation, O'Neil did lose some important players such as Max Kilman and Pedro Neto in the summer, as well as having a tough opening spell of fixtures. The club clearly showed its faith with a new four-year contract in the summer.\n    \n    This vital win against Southampton now has to be the platform for improvement for Wolves and O'Neil because they are still in a precarious position.\n    \n17.

      "headline": "Leny Yoro call, Marcus Rashford change - Ruben Amorim could spring five Manchester United surprises",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era.\n\nAmorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\n\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nThe 20-year-old could also thrive in one of the two No.10 roles behind a central striker even if there is plenty of competition for places with the likes of skipper Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Joshua Zirkzee, Mount and Amad all perhaps eyeing one of those spots.\n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n**Rashford up top**\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line.\n\nHe has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nRasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible.\n\nIn his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte.\n\nBut in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again."

The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United on February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side."

The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen."

The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\n\"His body language under Erik ten Hag was not of a player who enjoyed playing and those were not good signs, he needs to buy into the new system because if he doesn’t he will be moved on by Amorim. It’s up to both the player and the manager but predominantly Rashford, he’s on huge money but sometimes that isn’t enough motivation. When I was working at United, the big intrinsic motivation was one, to play for Manchester United and number two, to be successful at Manchester United. It was all about winning.\n\n\"It's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. That is already a coping mechanism to deal with when things are not going that well. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\"\n\n(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\n\n22:09Bruna Reis\n\n### Manchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens.

Despite playing such a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on. I don't know who buys him at the moment.

He told L'Equipe: \"Football players have to do their job. We are paid to play, to represent our club. I am happy with what they said. I am confident, if there are problems, they will solve them. We do not want to think about anything else but the next step, playing on Saturday.\n\nWhen quizzed about the transfer window reopening in less than six weeks, Matic has suggested he is keen to remain in France, adding: \"Everyone for sale? We need a team to play. This is the first time I've heard that everyone is for sale. I've never experienced that. I understand the question, but I don't think it's true.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n19:01Bruna Reis\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee future claim\n\nItalian outlet La Sampa (via Calcio Mecato) has claimed the striker has requested his agent to find him another move in the winter with Juventus a possible destination.\n\nThere has been speculation over the Dutchman's future since the sacking of Erik ten Hag.

He is very happy to be here. What we want is to have him for as long as possible.\"\n\nGyokeres, who joined Sporting for a fee of around £20million, has already played down reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford.\n\nHe said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\n\n\"He [Amorim] probably already has strikers there. It's very sad that he left [Sporting], but of course, we understand the decision.

So Man United want to cover that position.\n\n\"This summer, they decided to go with Noussair Mazraoui, this was the plan. So last summer, last transfer window, because they believed that Mazraoui could cover the two positions, right and left-back.\n\n\"But in 2025, Man United want to sign an important left-back to also play in a different kind of position for Ruben Amorim. He wants a top left-footed player in that position.\"\n\n(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\n\n16:43Bruna Reis\n\n### Transfer contact 'made' ahead of January\n\nParis Saint-Germain's Kolo Muani is reportedly a target for Man United.\n\nFrench outlet Le 10 Sport report United have ‘made contact’ in a deal to sign the striker amid uncertainty over Joshua Zirkzee's future.\n\nSpeaking to the French media while on international duty this month, Muani said: \"No, I’ve never thought about leaving PSG in January.

Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\n\n\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also vowed he would score more goals with his right foot and told reporters he would show them \"his notes one day.\" Antony does not lack self belief - he wouldn't be at United without it - but he's failed to back up his words on the pitch, which is how he's judged.\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/antony-might-manchester-united-lifeline-30418441)\n\n16:08Bruna Reis\n\n### Man United receive transfer response\n\nUnited are reportedly leading the race for Rosenborg midfielder Sverre Nypan, according to reports.\n\nHowever, Give Me Sport has reported the 17-year-old is keen to secure first-team assurances before making a decision on potentially moving to Old Trafford in the coming months.\n\nHe is said to be valued in the region of £84million and has been compared to Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard.

The report adds that he has been on City's radar since his Midtjylland days and have made him as a ‘priority’ signing.\n\nWith that said, Amorim is claimed to have 'already spoken with Diamonde' over the prospect of joining him at Old Trafford.

Kolo Muani has started just two of his 12 games this season.\n\nHe has managed to score twice but has barely played 70 minutes in Ligue 1 since the end of September. All of his four Champions League appearances have been from the bench.\n\nThe 25-year-old is said to be a target for United, amid the possibility that Joshua Zirkzee leaves on loan in January to regain form after an unsettled start to his stay at Old Trafford.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani (Image: Getty Images)\n\n13:02Isaac Johnson\n\n### Porro camp 'expecting' Amorim approach\n\nReports in Spain claim the representatives of Tottenham defender Pedro Porro are 'convinced' that Ruben Amorim will make an approach for him next year.\n\nSpanish outlet AS suggests the pair still hold a great relationship from their time together at Sporting CP, when the right-back played 98 times under Amorim.\n\nPorro played as a wing-back under the 39-year-old in Lisbon and could therefore be a target for Amorim at United, the report claims.\n\nTottenham defender Pedro Porro (Image: Getty Images)\n\n12:35KEY EVENT\n\n### Sporting braced for United transfer raid on Quenda\n\nSporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid.\n\nGeovany Quenda is of interest of Manchester United (Image: David Martins)\n\n12:04Isaac Johnson\n\n### Zirkzee agent 'contacts' Juventus\n\nA report in Italy claims that Joshua Zirkzee's agent has contacted Juventus over a potential January move amid the striker's unsettled start to life at Unied.\n\nZirkzee only arrived from Bologna in the summer, being signed for £36.5m. He has struggled to adapt to English football, failing to score in his last 16 appearances since scoring on debut against Fulham.\n\nNow, Calciomercato says his agent, Kia Joorabchian, has been speaking with Juventus chief Cristiano Giuntoli about a winter loan back to Italy in a bid for the player to rediscover his form.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee has only scored one goal for Manchester United since his move from Bologna (Image: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\n\n11:23Isaac Johnson\n\n### Sane addresses future amid United links\n\nUnited have been tentatively linked with a potential move for Leroy Sane amid reports the German is looking to leave Bayern next summer.\n\nThe winger has been backed for a return to the Premier League, and he has now opened up about what the future may hold for him.\n\nSpeaking to BILD, he said: “I have confidence in myself, in the situation and also in my club. We are in a transparent and relaxed exchange.\n\n“I will definitely not sign for another club on January 1 or 2. I don’t need a quick decision. I have a sympathy for the Premier League, I still watch certain games on TV.\n\n\"The attraction for me lies in the club where I can show my best performance, develop and win titles.

Statistics-wise, he has tallied three goals and two assists in 10 matches thus far.\n\n\"He is among the best signings of the last summer,\" Zola told Corriere dello Sport. \"Here in England, they can’t understand how Man United could let him go.

However, the latter has struggled to make an impact in England since his £36.5million move from Bologna.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer.

After scoring on his United debut against Fulham on the opening day of the Premier League season, Zirkzee has failed to find the back of the net.\n\nSince Erik ten Hag has left the club, reports have emerged claiming the Dutchman was not overly sold on the striker. Now, with Ruben Amorim in charge, Zirkzee has an opportunity to live up to the expectations around his signing.\n\nHowever, reports in Italy are now saying the 23-year-old has asked to leave the club in the January transfer window. Calciomercato previously linked the striker with a return to Italy and they have followed that up by insisting Zirkzee is unhappy at United and is 'seriously considering' leaving.\n\nThe report states that Zirkzee has instructed his agent to find him another move in the winter with Juventus a potential destination. Managed by Thiago Motta, who Zirkzee built up a great relationship with at Bologna, the Old Lady are said to be considering their options in attack should Dusan Vlahovic depart.\n\nA move away from Old Trafford for Zirkzee would add more fuel to the fire concerning Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting CP star is a man in-demand due to his terrific goalscoring record in Portugal, though a potential £63m move isn't expected to be possible until the summer."

      "headline": "Man United told 'big problem' could cost £55m if Amorim can't find solution",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing such a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nIn fact, Rashford's last appearance for the Three Lions was back in March, where he was given a mere cameo off the bench in a friendly against Brazil. So, he'll be hoping to transform his fortunes, starting this weekend when Amorim leads United out for the very first time.\n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on.\n\n\"I don't know who buys him at the moment. It will be interesting to see how he performs under Amorim, certainly something to keep an eye on.\"\n\nAccording to Capology, Rashford currently earns £15.6m a year at United, making him the joint-second highest paid player alongside Bruno Fernandes behind Casemiro. So, with three and a half seasons remaining – and approximately £54.6m left to be paid out – on his deal, higher-ups will be hoping Amorim can help the club get a much greater value for their money."

We could all become darts players if we practiced,\" Keane said.\n\nWright noted the 2023 World Championship final when Michael Smith and Michael van Gerwen as a memorable moment. \"It's magnificent is the darts,\" Wright said.\n\n\"It is a bit rowdy but to watch that... Like remember last year when they were both on for the nine darter! Watching that in the moment, it was watching perfection. Two guys at the very highest level, the peak of their performance, one of the most exciting things I've ever seen.\"\n\nAt the time, Neville, Scott and Wright then chose a nickname for Keane, who has been known for his downbeat and blunt nature. \"Roy 'the Killer' Keane,\" Neville suggested. \"Roy 'the Grumbler' Keane,\" Wright added."

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim has three key Man United selection decisions to make as first task clear",
      "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is beginning to settle into his new surroundings and there are already a number of key decisions to make ahead of his Premier League bow against Ipswich Town.\n\nTaking over during an international can have its positives, such as an extended period to implement new ideas, and negatives - including a depleted squad due to international involvement. For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad, fresh off the back of a busy summer of spending, but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s.\n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in their dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up, while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nThe United medical team will be keeping a close eye on the treatment table. In recent weeks Yoro returned to first-team training in recent weeks but United will have to monitor his workload after the summer signing picked up an injury during pre-season and has yet to play a competitive minute.\n\nEqually with Luke Shaw, who was stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks, after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.\n\nWith the excitement around Amorim's opening months in charge, a series of training pictures from sessions this week merely whet the appetite of the Old Trafford masses. There were sights of Mason Mount, Leny Yoro, Malacia and the welcome return of Kobbie Mainoo - as well as an opportunity for several youngsters to brush shoulders with the first-team."

      "headline": "Erik ten Hag spotted back in England as ex-Manchester United boss weighs up next move",
      "article_text": "Erik ten Hag was spotted back in Manchester on Monday. The former Manchester United manager dined in an Italian restaurant and cleared out possessions from a nearby home.\n\nTen Hag oversaw the worst start to a Premier League campaign in United's history and was sacked following a controversial 2-1 defeat to West Ham at the London Stadium. The Dutchman's dismissal was confirmed on October 28 and he immediately returned to the Netherlands to spend time with his family.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis and United moved swiftly to appoint Ruben Amorim from Sporting Lisbon as Ten Hag's successor. Ten Hag was pictured in Hale exactly three weeks after his United departure. He dined in his regular haunt Piccolino and visited his residence to clear out his possessions.\n\nTen Hag was joined by his wife Bianca and the couple left the restaurant as the Manchester snow began on Monday night. A few days after he was sacked, Ten Hag watched Heracles in the Eredivisie and he also made a return to Ajax to watch another game before the international break.\n\nUnited triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract in the summer after clinching glory in the FA Cup final and he received a multi-million pay out following his sacking. Although the 54-year-old's intentions after leaving United aren't clear, there is expected to be interest in Ten Hag from European clubs and he is expected to return to management.\n\nTen Hag was spotted in Manchester on the same day as Amorim's first training session at Carrington. The 39-year-old was forced to wait until his visa was approved to coach on grass - he was allowed to hold meetings with staff - and took a session with nine senior players.\n\nAmorim's first game in charge of United will come against Ipswich Town this weekend and he must move United into the top half of the table, as they are currently 13th in the league.\n\nAfter Ten Hag's exit, the Dutchman wrote an emotional letter to United fans and said: \"Dear fans, Let me start by thanking you. Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable.\n\n\"The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents stadiums, whether the game was in England, Europe or during the summer tours.\n\n\"I always enjoyed meeting Manchester United fans throughout the world. Walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in England, Europe, Asia, Australia, the USA - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity. That's what makes United supporters so special.\n\n\"I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.\n\n\"We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end.\n\n\"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.\""

      "article_text": "Manchester United promote another exciting 16-year-old to first-team training - Manchester Evening News\nRuben Amorim coached his first Man Utd training session on Monday and several youngsters were involved.\nManchester United youngster Jim Thwaites took part in first-team training on Monday, despite being aged just 16 years old. There are multiple senior players who are still away on international duty, meaning youngsters were needed to make up the numbers in Ruben Amorim's first training session. Among the academy players to be called up was Thwaites, who was also given the opportunity to train with the first-team by Erik ten Hag ahead of facing Brighton in August.\nThwaites is considered as one of the academy's leading prospects in his age group and won the club's Goal of the Season award for both Under-16 and Under-18 level last term. The youngster's great form has continued into this campaign and he recently scored a stunning free-kick.\nThwaites has contributed four goals and two assists in just three starts - he has made a total of nine appearances - for the U18s and has spent some time with the U16 group. He was expected to be given a prominent role in Adam Lawrence's U18 side this season and he's gone from strength to strength, making an appearance in every U18 league game. Different sources have suggested Thwaites has slightly gone under the radar in the conversation about emerging prospects and the youngster has been tipped to have a bright future.\nThwaites was the second 16-year-old to be involved in Amorim's first training session, as imposing defender Godwill Kukonki also took part, which was a huge milestone in his career.\n\n**Senior players involved:**\nTom Heaton, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro, Amad, Antony, Marcus Rashford."

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim might be about to change Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United plan",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim might be about to change Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United plan - George Smith - Manchester Evening News\nBruno Fernandes is likely to play a key part in Ruben Amorim's thinking at Man United - but his role could be a lot different to what he had previously envisioned.\nSuspended for Portugal's final game of their UEFA Nations League campaign on Monday night, Ruben Amorim must have welcomed Roberto Martinez's decision to release Bruno Fernandes from international duty early.\nThe Manchester United captain earned his second yellow card of the campaign in Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland on Friday night as they secured their position at the top of Group A1 with a game to spare, ruling him out of the trip to Croatia. As a result of clinching top spot, Portugal boss Martinez made the decision to release a handful of players from his squad early, no doubt to the delight of their respective clubs.\nMartinez's decision has means Fernandes is set for more time on the training ground ahead of Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town. The trip to Portman Road will mark the beginning of a new era at United, with new head coach Amorim taking charge for the very first time.\nThe recent arrival of the 39-year-old has given everyone associated with United a much-needed lift, not least the supporters, who are eager to see how the former Sporting Lisbon boss will take the club forward. Although Amorim refused to get bogged down in the topic of formations during his first interview as United boss, the expectation is that he will unleash a new-look 3-4-3 system from the off. It was the bedrock of much of his success at Sporting.\nThe prospect of United starting with a brand-new shape at Portman Road is attracting plenty of intrigue ahead of Amorim's debut in the dugout. Under Erik ten Hag, United very rarely lined up in anything other than a 4-3-3.\nThe switch to a system featuring wing-backs means Fernandes is expected to be dragged out of midfield and operate in the front-three. The general expectation is that he will start in an inverted wide role. The prospect of Amorim making that decision will represent a complete contrast to the role Fernandes envisions making his own in years to come. So often reliable wherever he plays, Fernandes earlier this year admitted that he expects to become a No.6 as his career continues to evolve.\n\"I have played, however, especially last season with coach Ten Hag, deeper,\" said Fernandes, speaking in March. \"In fact, against Everton, I played No.6 and I still think it was one of the most complete games I've played, at all levels.\n\"In terms of passing, game organisation, defence, tactics. I have a little thought in my head that I'm going to end my career further back, because everyone who started there and went to No.10 ended up retreating on the field at the end.\n\"It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.\n\"The game with Everton was the one in which I created the most scoring opportunities, even though I was playing deeper and not playing as a No.10.\"\nRegarded as United's most creative midfielder, there is little chance of Fernandes occupying one of the two natural midfield roles in Amorim's preferred formation. They are likely to be reserved by Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo, who are more defensively astute than Fernandes.\nFernandes never shirked away from the challenge of occasionally being deployed out wide under Ten Hag, often excelling because of his versatility and excellent tactical awareness. With United's width under Amorim expected to be supplied by the wing-backs, Fernandes' 'wide role' could actually be very subtle."

      "article_text": "Why Erik ten Hag is in a more secure position than previous Manchester United managers - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nWhy Erik ten Hag is in a more secure position than previous Manchester United managers\n======================================================================================\n\nMan United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.\n\nThe misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.\n\nOf the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.\n\n**READ MORE: [Only one United centre half is certain of staying next season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/only-one-manchester-united-centre-28328724)**\n\n**READ MORE: [Eight United players face an uncertain winter transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/eight-manchester-united-players-facing-28324556)**\n\nDe Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.\n\nAs costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.\n\nThat last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.\n\nThere are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.\n\nOnly one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.\n\nThe difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.\n\nTen Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.\n\nThere is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.\n\nPotter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.\n\nPotter is not a credible threat to Ten Hag for now.\n\nFan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.\n\nUnited bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.\n\nHalf-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.\n\nThat was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off."

A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.\n\nBlanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday."

Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.\n\nThe 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, [Darren](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher). The [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.

Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.\n\nJack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nIt was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.\n\nFletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.\n\nIf Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\n  \n\nWhich is which? Jack (far left) and Tyler (far right) line up in Istanbul\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\n  \n\nA 16-year-old Darren Fletcher at The Cliff in April 2000\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\n  \n\nFletcher in his United blazer at Swindon\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which."

The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.\n\n“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"\n\nGore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.\n\nHe trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.\n\nAlthough Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised [Wayne Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) and [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.\n\n\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the _Manchester Evening News_. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.\n\n\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.\n\n\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.\n\n  \n\n\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"\n\nGore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.\n\n\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.\n\n\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.\n\n\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\n\n  \n\nGore (centre, bottom row) with Burnley's academy.\n\nMike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.\n\n\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.\n\n\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.\n\n\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.\n\n\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"\n\nHargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.\n\n  \n\n\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.\n\n\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"\n\nThe burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.\n\n\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.\n\n\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.\n\n\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\n\n  \n\nGore playing for the academy in 2019.\n\nGore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.\n\n\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.\n\n\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\n\nHargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.\n\n\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.\n\n\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"\n\n  \n\nGore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. [Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dan-gore-man-united-fernandes-27802126) has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.\n\n\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.\n\n\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"\n\nHargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"\n\nGore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon."

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim can unleash a Manchester United partnership Erik ten Hag only used once vs Ipswich",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim can unleash a Manchester United partnership Erik ten Hag only used once vs Ipswich\n\nMan United head coach Ruben Amorim has been given a much-needed boost ahead of his first game in charge on Sunday.\n\nThe sight of Kobbie Mainoo back on the grass at the Carrington earlier this week was exactly what Manchester United's supporters wanted to see ahead of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge this weekend.\n\nThe academy graduate has been missing for more than a month through injury, last featuring in United's 0-0 draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park on October 6.\n\nMissing the last seven matches, the prospect of Mainoo being in contention for Amorim's debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon will be a welcome boost for the new Reds head coach.\n\nNext Tuesday will mark exactly a year to the day since Mainoo made his full Premier League debut for United, starring in their 3-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park. Deployed at the base of the midfield that afternoon, he produced an outstanding display.\n\nFrom that moment onwards, Mainoo became a staple in United's midfield, starting 23 of the their remaining 25 Premier League matches last season. He had gone from being a promising academy product to a first-team undroppable in the blink of an eye.\n\nAlthough Mainoo made his mark against Everton as a holding midfielder, it soon became apparent he was more comfortable getting on the ball and advancing. He is a forward-thinking player, capable of receiving the ball and looking to attack.\n\nAmid Casemiro's downfall last season, United went into the summer transfer window knowing they had to recruit a world-class defensive-midfielder to sit alongside Mainoo in the engine room. After several months of speculation, Manuel Ugarte joined the club from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day.\n\n\"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer,\" said sporting director Dan Ashworth. \"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.\n\n\"His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"\n\nSigning a player of Ugarte's profile was exactly what both United and Mainoo needed. The Uruguayan was expected to slot straight into United's first-choice midfield and become Mainoo's perfect partner.\n\nHowever, former United manager Erik ten Hag, who had made Ugarte his third-choice midfield signing during the summer, was not forthcoming when it came to giving the former Sporting Lisbon man an opportunity to make an early mark at Old Trafford. He featured just seven times under the Dutchman, making four starts.\n\nOf those four starts, it was only on one of them that he lined up alongside Mainoo in midfield. They both started the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 29, but Mainoo was substituted just before half-time with United both 1-0 down and a man down, following the sending off of Bruno Fernandes.\n\nIt was a forgettable afternoon, meaning it was hard to assess just how Ugarte and Mainoo could work in tandem.\n\nSince their last and only start together, a lot has changed at Old Trafford, of course. Ten Hag has been sacked and replaced by Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has spent several weeks out injured and Ugarte has earned more minutes as a starter.\n\nThe 23-year-old worked with Amorim at Sporting prior to his move to PSG in July 2023 and has made more appearances under the new United boss than any other coach during his senior career, meaning he is highly likely to become an important figure in his plans at United.\n\nUgarte, under former United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, formed a strong bond with Casemiro in midfield, but Mainoo's recent return to training means he could soon replace the Brazilian in the starting XI, forming Amorim's first-choice midfield next to Ugarte.\n\nOn paper, a midfield partnership of Ugarte and Mainoo offers a blend of defensive nous, ball retention and the opportunity to progress the ball. It is the midfield duo many United supporters anticipated becoming the club's first-choice partnership after Ugarte's August arrival.\n\nThe likelihood of Amorim installing a 3-4-3 formation means Fernandes, who previously operated as the most advanced midfielder in Ten Hag's preferred 4-3-3, is expected to be forced further forward, leaving two midfield spots up for grabs.\n\nUgarte is expected to bag one of them and Mainoo should claim the other once he is back up to full fitness, whether that be this weekend or a little further down the line. At the ages of 23 and 19, respectively, they should form United's midfield for the future."

The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who comes with a high reputation, has repeatedly urged his players to increase their pace throughout the week as he aims to make an immediate impact, with reports stating he has been taken aback by the lack of speed and intensity in training sessions.\n\nAmorim plans to quickly implement his 3-4-3 system and it's understood that he already knows certain players won't be able to adapt to it, reports The Sun. His coaching staff and analysts are working hard to get the players up to speed with Amorim's set-up.\n\nThe 39-year-old's first game in charge will be against Ipswich Town on Sunday, where United are expected to showcase a new look under Amorim's guidance. Despite being surprised by certain aspects of training and some players, Amorim has also been impressed by the quality of others.\n\nDespite currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League following their worst ever start to a season, Amorim believes this does not accurately reflect where the team should be.\n\nDespite the significant investment in the squad, United are still not ready to compete for the title. Amorim has reportedly been forthright in his critique of the team's performance, which he believes has been subpar for over a decade.\n\nHe has apparently told his players that they have been 'living in Sir Alex Ferguson's shadow', unable to emulate his success. The last Premier League title was won under Ferguson in 2013, and Amorim feels that the team has failed to harness his spirit as a motivating force.\n\nA source told The Sun: 'He told them that top managers have not replicated Sir Alex's success because they have lived in his shadow, rather than getting their team to play with his spirit.'"

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim takes charge of his first Manchester United game this weekend. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)\n\nNew Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is preparing to take charge of his first game this weekend. The Reds take on Ipswich Town at Portman Road as they look to get off to the perfect start under the Portuguese manager.\n\nFull concentration will be on that game, but looking down the fixture list is a run of three Premier League games that catch the eye. And Amorim doesn’t have long to get his feet under the table before they are upon United.\n\nThe run starts with an away trip to face Arsenal on Wednesday, December 4 (8.15pm kick-off). Just three days later United host high-flying Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford.\n\nThere is then a midweek Europa League trip to take on Viktoria Plzen before United are back in Premier League action on Sunday, December 15 (4.30pm kick-off). That games sees the first Manchester derby of the season at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nThe three Premier League games in that run at the start of next month sees United come up against three of the current top five. Results could potentially define if a top-four challenge under the new boss is realistic for the end of the season.\n\nA run of positive results will close the gap and raise confidence within the United squad. It would be a perfect set-up for the second half of the season.\n\nHowever, if the results aren’t so positive it could have the opposite effect. It would make a potential challenge for Champions League football next season a lot harder.\n\nUnited currently sit in 13th place in the Premier League table, having picked up 15 points from their opening 11 games of the season. That leaves them four points off Arsenal in fourth place, a gap that could potentially reduce to just one point should United come out victorious in the opening game of the run.\n\nNottingham Forest, in fifth place, are also just four points ahead of United. Man City, meanwhile, sit in second place on 23 points, seven points ahead of United.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side have however hit a dip in form. They have lost their last four in all competitions, if that run continues that United could close the gap significantly before the meeting between the two teams next month."

      "headline": "Man United target Viktor Gyokeres teases transfer in Ruben Amorim message",
      "article_text": "Viktor Gyokeres has hinted at a potential exit from Sporting Clube de Portugal at the end of this season. The Swedish striker has become one of Europe's most coveted talents following his stellar performances with the Portuguese champions, netting 23 club goals in just 16 matches this season.\n\nDespite having a £83.5million (€100m) release clause in his contract, it is believed that Sporting president Frederico Varandas would entertain offers around £66m (€80m), provided Gyokeres remains with Sporting until the season concludes. This development is likely to pique the interest of some of Europe's top clubs and could spark a fierce battle for his signature next summer.\n\nFollowing Manchester United's recent appointment of Gyokeres' former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, they are considered one of the favourites to secure Gyokeres. Amorim and Gyokeres shared a strong bond during their time together in Lisbon.\n\nGiven United's current struggles for goals in the Premier League this season, they are in desperate need of a world-class finisher. Amorim, who will spend his initial six months at United assessing the squad, was informed when he left the Portuguese club last week that he wouldn't be permitted to approach them in the January transfer window and would have to wait until the summer.\n\nAmorim will also benefit from the substantial financial backing of United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Gyokeres was asked about a potential move. He said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course I want to finish the season at Sporting, I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future.\"\n\nThe prolific Sweden international then teased that a move away from Sporting could happen, adding: \"We'll see when the time comes.\"\n\nWhen commenting on Amorim's switch to United, Gyokeres did not hide his emotions, stating: \"It's very sad that he left, but of course we understand the decision.\""

      "article_text": "Former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian has explained the 'completely different world' he was opened up to when he joined the club in July 2015.\n\nDarmian was brought to Old Trafford by Louis van Gaal and spent four years at the club racking up 92 appearances in the process. He would leave permanently in September 2019 to join Parma before eventually arriving at Inter where he remains to this day.\n\nWhile his time at United is seen as largely forgettable, despite winning the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup at Old Trafford, Darmian has now admitted that his spell in the Premier League opened him up to a new aspect of football. \"When I signed for Manchester United, I discovered that in England, during away games, family members don’t have a reserved section; they sit among the fans,\" he told Cronache di Spogliatoio.\n\n\"The first match was the derby against Liverpool. I told my girlfriend: ‘Look, it’s a very intense match. Do you still want to come?’\n\n\"And she said: ‘Yes, of course, I really care.’ So, she got in the car with the steering wheel on the right and went into the away section.\n\n\"For a footballer, the English football culture brings less pressure. During the week, there’s less talk about football; the weekend and the experience of going to the stadium are more important.\"\n\nWhile this was a culture shock, it was a mere footnote compared to the off-field duties that were expected of him - with the defender revealing the club demanding he open an Instagram account shortly after his arrival. \"As soon as I arrived in Manchester, I discovered a completely new world,\" he added.\n\n\"In Italy, very few players had social media profiles. In England, on my first day, they immediately told me to open an Instagram account and that I would need to participate in commercial initiatives.\n\n\"What now seems normal wasn’t back then. There were so many commercial activities; it was a completely different world from what I was used to.\n\n\"In the following years, [Paul] Pogba and [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic also arrived, and they were media superstars.\""

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim guarantee could give Manchester United fans what they have been crying out for - Tyrone Marshall - Manchester Evening News\nRuben Amorim has started preparations for his first game as Man Utd head coach and has told fans what to expect at Portman Road.\n\nRuben Amorim has told United fans they quickly see his \"idea\" bought to life on the pitch.\n\nIn his first interview as Manchester United's head coach, Ruben Amorim kept returning to a couple of buzzwords that could define his early weeks at Old Trafford.\n\nDuring his chat with club media, he referred to his \"idea\" five times and discussed his team's \"identity\" six times. This was very clearly sending a message. There were no promises of results, but there was a guarantee that supporters would see a plan very quickly.\n\n\"I think you will see an idea. You could like it or not, I don't know, but you will see an idea. You will see a positioning. You will see something,\" Amorim said of the first impression his team will deliver.\n\n\"Something that we want to reach that kind of level. You will feel that. But we have to know that it's like two training \\[sessions\\] before the first match. This is the best league in the world. But if I have to say something to you, you will see an idea. This I can guarantee.\"\n\nThat alone will be music to the ears of United fans who became fed up watching a team without an identity. Erik ten Hag might have delivered two trophies to Old Trafford, but there was never a sense that he was building a side with a clear style of play.\n\nThey became a moments team, individuals producing a brilliant piece of play to create or score a goal and win a game. From the beginning of last season, very few 90-minute performances suggested a clear tactical plan being implemented by the whole team. United were too open, too easy to play against, and too vulnerable to teams set up creatively with a clear plan.\n\nAmorim clearly intends to change that. When Ten Hag held his first press conference, he said the players available to him would generally dictate the style of play. The new head coach intends to stick with his philosophy and his 3-4-3, with the players moulded to fit into that structure.\n\nIn some ways, the excitement around Amorim's first game at United is similar to that which greeted Jurgen Klopp's first as Liverpool boss. Again, the anticipation levels rose across an international break. Klopp sent out a team that pressed in a manner they hadn't done previously, and although the goalless draw at Tottenham was low on quality, it was a team that suggested he had a plan and would stick to it.\n\nUnited fans will be tuning in at Portman Road, expecting to see something similar. Amorim's teams are built on different principles, but pressing will be critical, as will the role and energy of his wing-backs. Who is picked to play in what position will also be fascinating.\n\nTwo training sessions with his entire squad won't be enough for Amorim to instil all of his ideas. Having taken over at the start of the busiest stretch of the season, it could be months before he looks at his team and believes they have definitely got it.\n\nBut if supporters can look at the side that plays Ipswich this weekend, then Bodo Glimt and Everton at Old Trafford, and see the outline of a plan and identity coming together, then they will be happy. It's been too long since a United team was clearly identifiable by its patterns of play and its philosophy on the pitch."

      "article_text": "But the long term reliability of United's two recognised left-backs has been called into question given they have had to operate without either player since February. As such, there is talk United could look to strengthen their options in that department and Benfica's Alvaro Fernandez Carreras has emerged as an option to return to the club.\n\nThe Spanish defender left Old Trafford to join the Portuguese giants for £6million in the summer and has quickly established himself as an important player at the Estadio Da Luz, despite some initial suspicion.\n\n\"With a mixture of cautious optimism and suspicion,\" Alfredo Fumacas of the Benfica Podcast told the Manchester Evening News when asked about the initial reception around Benfica when they signed the Spanish under-21 international.\n\n\"Alejandro Grimaldo who joined Benfica midseason during the 2015/16 season provided consistency to a position which, up until that point, was a bit of a revolving door between inconsistency and players who just weren't at the level required.\n\n\"Grimaldo was able to secure the starting spot, and remained a staple of championship Benfica teams for seven-and-a-half seasons. Following Grimaldo's departure toBayer Leverkusen, Benfica was again faced with the lack of quality at the left back position.\n\n\"When Carreras joined half way through the 2023/24 season there were a lot of questions in terms of his worth. Was he going to be more cannon fodder, like David Jurasek, and Mihailo Ristic before him?\n\n\"There was the connection to Man United, but the successive loan spells at Preston and Granada, left Benfica fans suspicious of his worth, but cautiously optimistic at the same time.\n\n\"Carreras has had an impressive ascent this season, and part of it has been due to [former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager] Bruno Lage's arrival after the sacking of Roger Schmidt. Lage's tactics and game idea suits Carreras' abilities.\n\n\"He has not only evolved under Lage, but he has also grown extremely confident with mounting good performances this early in the season. Lately he is being looked at as a proper Grimaldo replacement, and has made many of the fans forget the Leverkusen full-back.\"\n\nFernandez has featured in all 16 of Benfica's matches this season across the Primeira Liga, Champions League, Taca da Liga and Taca de Portugal and has gone from strength to strength. He was unable to force his way into United's plans during his time in Manchester but has quickly grown into an important player in Lisbon and he is already attracting transfer attention from a number of big European clubs.\n\nUnited inserted a €20million buyback clause into the deal to sell him and despite only leaving the club a matter of months ago, there is already concern in the Portuguese capital that he may return to Old Trafford.\n\n\"Of course there's concern from Benfica,\" Fumacas explained. \"Benfica initially brought in Carreras on a loan, but activated the buy clause of €6m in the beginning of the season, knowing that there was a buy back clause of €20m, at the time there were some questions from the fans in terms of his worth.\n\n\"I don't believe Benfica expected Carreras to rise up this quickly and to be on the radar of many European clubs, usually Benfica can keep suitors at bay with high release causes, but €20m will be a bargain for a 21-year-old with lots of potential.\"\n\nWith Amorim's budget said to be a little more limited to the transfer warchest afforded to Erik ten Hag last summer, a move for Fernandez would be an affordable option to solve a problem area. Given he knows the club, and Amorim will be well aware of his qualities having managed Benfica's city rivals Sporting CP, it would be a move that would suit all parties on paper.\n\n\"On paper he is a good fit, along with doing very well covering the left flank and combining well with his teammates,\" Fumacas added. \"He has also played as a third centre-half at Benfica during some tactical variations by Lage.\n\n\"He likes to associate with the midfield in the build-up process, and does very well in short combinations, and getting into the final third - reminiscent of Alejandro Grimaldo, but with more of a defensive ability to his game.\n\n\"I feel Carreras is doing well at Benfica because of the trust Lage has put in him, and because he has been able to win the hearts of the fans with his performances.\n\n\"Playing at Old Trafford, where he didn't have the best of times, endured rejection, albeit normal for the process of a young player, may be something that will weigh on his psyche, but we are also talking about a 21 year old Carreras who has evolved mentally with the experiences he's had.\""

      "headline": "Antony might have Manchester United lifeline after 'annoyed' comment",
      "article_text": "Antony has been an awful signing for Man Utd but might have one last chance to save his career at Old Trafford.\n\nThe majority of fans believe Manchester United should cut their losses on Antony. The winger's time in Manchester since he signed from Ajax in a deal worth £86million has been disastrous and he looks destined to be remembered as one of the worst signings in the club's history.\n\n“Antony is one of the most exciting young talents in European football and has exactly the right profile for the attacking, dynamic team that Erik ten Hag is building,\" said former football director John Murtough when he was signed. That statement is 25 months old but hasn't aged well.\n\nIt might have been worth double checking Antony's passport to check if he's Brazilian. He doesn't have the flair, creativity or quality that is associated with South America's greatest footballing exports, although the 'Anturny' did cause quite a stir in his first few months at the club. The 'Anturny' skill move wouldn't have been a talking point if he had enjoyed a brilliant first season but he contributed just four goals and two assists in the Premier League.\n\nAlthough Antony scored in his first three league appearances against Arsenal, Manchester City and Everton, which is remarkable with the benefit of hindsight, he didn't score in the top flight again for six months and it didn't take long for many to conclude he wasn't good enough for United.\n\nBut you should always give players the benefit of the doubt and a season to settle. Antony needed to grab the bull by the horns in his second year at Old Trafford and silence the growing doubters but he actually regressed, producing just one goal and one assist in the league.\n\n\"I definitely need more goal participations and to score more goals,\" he told a handful of journalists in a Beverly Hills hotel while on pre-season tour in August. \"It's something I demand from myself. Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\n\n\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also vowed he would score more goals with his right foot and told reporters he would show them \"his notes one day.\" Antony does not lack self belief - he wouldn't be at United without it - but he's failed to back up his words on the pitch, which is how he's judged.\n\nAntony has started one game this season, against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup when he converted a penalty against League One opposition. He has been given just over 150 minutes in all competitions.\n\nTen Hag's decision to overlook Amad for Antony when he made a substitution against Fenerbahce in the Europa League was surprising, but he explained he works hard in training. To Antony's credit, he looked bright when coming on but picked up an injury and had to be stretchered off.\n\nUnfortunately for Antony, not much has gone right for him during his time in Manchester - he has dealt with issues away from the pitch - and he's in the last chance saloon at United.\n\nThe appointment of Ruben Amorim offers a clean slate but Antony must be sold in the summer window if he's unable to improve between now until the end of the season.\n\nWhat could spark that improvement? Perhaps he could play as a wing-back. It was fascinating to read him say playing at full-back initially \"annoyed\" him last season, because adapting and playing in that role in Amorim's system might be the only way to save his United career.\n\nAntony has transferable skills that could make him an effective wing-back but playing him there would be a desperate roll of the dice, with the hope of unlocking some improvement. Whether a position change would work remains to be seen. Antony's time might already be up."

      "headline": "Jamie Carragher says what Ruben Amorim did in first week at Man United should excite supporters",
      "article_text": "Jamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nThe 39-year-old gave his first interview as the club’s new head boss last week, just days after arriving at Carrington. He underlined his eagerness to instil a sense of identity back into United and the importance of building momentum from the off.\n\nHe makes his debut at Ipswich Town on Sunday with United languishing in 13th. Amorim is expected to field his 3-4-3 formation that brought him two Portuguese titles at Sporting CP.\n\nWhile former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does “not think this squad is suited to three at the back”, he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way. \"I’ve been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,” he told The Overlap US.\n\n“He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?’\n\n“And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change’.\n\n“But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n“I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.”\n\nCarragher warned that Amorim faces heftier competition from lower-table teams in the Premier League than he did in Portugal. But he reckons that United will be put in good stead if Amorim is able to get his squad to buy in and then successfully implement his philosophy.\n\n“Let’s not forget, the Premier League has the best managers in the world and he’s coming up against some top operators, not even necessarily at the top end of the table,” Carragher added.\n\n“You look at people like Marco Silva or Thomas Frank, managers of teams in the middle of the table. They’re top managers.\n\n“I admired how confident [Amorim] was and this real belief he seems to have and if he can put that into Manchester United, because there’s still quality players there, and also make them believe in this system and how they go about it, I think he can do well."

      "headline": "Viktor Gyokeres to Man United transfer latest amid Ruben Amorim 'agreement' and Sporting dilemma",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is in his first week of taking Manchester United training following his move from Sporting CP over the international break. The manager takes charge of his first game on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick off) when United travel to take on Ipswich Town.\n\nThe arrival of Amorim has caused excitement among the United fan base. It has also started speculation over who he could sign in his first transfer window, with the January window fast approaching.\n\nOne of the names to be heavily linked is Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres. The 26-year-old is making waves across Europe with his goalscoring record.\n\nIn 18 domestic games across all competitions so far this season, he has scored 23 goals, including a hat trick in the Champions League win over Man City. The striker has also impressed on the international stage for Sweden, scoring nine goals in six Nations League appearances.\n\nAmorim’s move from sporting to United has led to speculation that he could be eyeing a reunion with his former striker. With that in mind, here is the latest on a potential move for Gyokeres, either in January or in the summer.\n\n#### ‘Gentleman’s agreement’\n\nAny potential move for Gyokeres in January could be put on hold, due to a reported ‘gentleman’s agreement’ between Amorim and former club Sporting CP. It is said that the manager has agreed not to approach any of Sporting’s players in the upcoming transfer window.\n\n[Journalist Fabrizio Romano claims](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-man-united-transfer-30418333) that as part of the negotiations that saw Amorim leave the club for United, the agreement was reached. That’s due to Sporting’s hopes of winning their respective title this season, although any summer move for players, including Gyokeres has not been ruled out.\n\n#### What the player has said\n\nGyokeres himself responded to rumours over his future earlier this week. He gave his thoughts on Amorim’s move to United, before commenting on the links.\n\n\"It’s very sad that he’s leaving, but of course we understand his decision,\" he said. \"He has of course meant a lot [to me] considering that he gave me that chance and that he made me develop so much.\"\n\nGyokeres then added: \"He [Amorim] probably has some strikers there already, so we’ll see. No, he hasn’t [contacted me]. It's fun but nothing I attach any importance to because it’s talk and nothing concrete.\"\n\n#### Sporting ‘need to sell’\n\nFormer Portuguese international Jose Fonte has provided hope to United over completing a deal, by highlighting the financial disparity between the two clubs. \"Portuguese clubs have got no option but to sell for the right price,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to sell. Portuguese clubs have to sell one or two players every season.\n\n\"We don't have the same TV rights as the Premier League so we don't have the capacity to hold on to players. It would be lovely to see Portugal with a little bit more capacity to hold on to their talent, of course.\"\n\n#### United monitoring the striker\n\nUnited Scouts were reportedly in attendance to watch Gyokeres in Sweden’s 2-1 victory over Sloviakia at the weekend. The striker, of course, was on the scoresheet, finding the back of the net after just three minutes to give his side the lead.\n\nScouts would have also been impressed with his performance in Sweden’s next game. The striker scored four times in his nation’s 6-0 win over Azerbaijan on Tuesday night.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   [Man United already have £25m windfall to help secure Ruben Amorim's dream first signing](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-already-25m-windfall-30415718?int_source=nba)\n*   [Joshua Zirkzee Man United transfer latest: Italy return, January exit, Viktor Gyokeres impact](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/joshua-zirkzee-man-united-transfer-30424296?int_source=nba)"

      "headline": "Gary Neville and Roy Keane disagree on Marcus Rashford decision ahead of Ruben Amorim Man United call",
      "article_text": "Gary Neville has called out Casemiro and Marcus Rashford for deciding to jet-off to the USA during November's international break, but his ex-Manchester United teammate didn't agree.\nRoy Keane did not take the same stance as ex-teammate Gary Neville.\n\nGary Neville says it was \"not right\" for Casemiro and Marcus Rashford to travel to the United States during the international break, given the poor season Manchester United are having, and suggests it might not have been what Ruben Amorim would have wanted.\n\nNeither was called up for their respective countries this month and so decided to travel to Portland to watch an NBA game. Neville has questioned the decision given the toll the long flights and time difference might have had on both players ahead of Amorim's first week at United.\n\nBoth were seen in high spirits during the new head coach's first training session at Carrington on Monday - ahead of Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town - but Neville is unsure that they have prepared themselves in the best way given the current context at United.\n\n\"I'd ask the question, would my manager want to see me there, would the fans at this moment in time?\" Neville mused. Former United skipper Roy Keane did not see much issue in their travels, though.\n\nHe said: \"They would have had the international break sorted a couple of weeks ago. I wouldn't be a big fan of it, but I would have thought there was bigger stuff to worry about.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, if they're training in the week and they're looking a bit sluggish... We saw pictures with the new manager coming in smiling, all happy, good PR!\"\n\nNeville went on: \"The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you're best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season.\n\n\"He [Rashford] has got a mental break - he's got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what's the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n\"This is on Casemiro more than Rashford, but if I'm 30-years-old and I'm looking after my body - and he's won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player - but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, then we would say he could struggle this weekend because he's been away.\n\n\"They have chosen that international break, almost. If you are talking about minor details - in being as professional as you can be and as prepared as you can be for a training session on a Monday night - that isn't the best choice of venue.\"\n\nNeville reckons that he's not overly irked by Casemiro and Rashford's trip, but does not believe either would have had copious amounts of rest time ahead of their return to training. He questioned whether the decision emanated acute \"professionalism\".\n\nNeville continued: \"I'm not that wound up about Rashford and Casemiro going over to the United States, but what I'm asking is; If you've got a four-day break, Portland is a 12-hour flight and an eight-hour time difference...\n\n\"Your jet-lag is bad, and you feel a bit [rough].\n\n\"They went to Portland and I'm asking the question based on professionalism - you're playing badly, the team are losing, you're 13th in the league, and there is a new manager coming in - would you choose that trip as a break to recharge your batteries? That's not a recharging trip. It's not right, that."

(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\n\n###### Get the latest MEN breaking news on WhatsApp\n\nRuben Amorim doesn’t have long to get his feet under the table at Manchester United before the chaos of a transfer window is upon us.\n\nThe new head coach started working with his players on the training pitch this week as preparations for the weekend’s clash against Ipswich start. The time in training will give Amorim a chance to assess his squad, with decisions to be made ahead of the transfer window that opens in less than two months.\n\nAny new boss is likely to be keen to bring in his own players when they have the chance. However, according to the Telegraph, worries over Profitability and Sustainability rules (PSRs), as well as the club wanting to implement a more sustainable structure, means that the transfer budget in January is to be ‘modest.’\n\n**READ MORE: I rejected a move to Manchester United - it would not have made me happy**\n\n**READ MORE: Man United star Antony got told 'behaving like an idiot' ruined Liverpool transfer hopes**\n\nHowever, one way of boosting the budget will be to sell players. With that in mind, here is a look at five players who United could cash in on in the winter window.\n\n#### Harry Maguire\n\nThe defender arrived for £80 million in the summer of 2019 but has found himself down the pecking order for the last couple of seasons. Maguire has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford over the last few transfer windows, with United even said to have agreed a £30 million fee with West Ham in the summer of 2023 with a move never materialising.\n\nMaguire will be entering the final six months of his contract when the January transfer window opens, it means, unless he signs a new deal, it will be United’s last chance to get some money back for the defender.\n\nWhile they may not get the £30 million agreed with West Ham 18 months ago, any fee would provide a boost to the transfer window funds.\n\n#### Victor Lindelof\n\nLindelof is in a similar situation to Maguire in that he will be entering the final six months of his contract when the January window opens. The Sweden international is also down the pecking order and has been linked with a move away.\n\nHowever, Amorim will have to make a decision over potentially losing two centre-backs in the same window. While getting money for them will provide a potential financial boost, it will leave Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinex and Jonny Evans as the centre-backs left in the squad.\n\n#### Christian Eriksen\n\nAnother player who will have just six months remaining on his deal in January. He was made available in the most recent transfer window, but decided to stay at Old Trafford for the final year of his contract.\n\nSpeaking about his future while on international duty, the Dane said: \"I haven't focused on it yet, and I haven't heard anything from the club. Right now it's just about football, and then we have to see where we stand in January and for that matter in the summer.\"\n\n#### Marcus Rashford\n\nRashford has struggled for form this season, and is one player who could bring in decent money to fund January incomings. As an academy graduate he would also represent pure profit, which would be a boost in terms of the Premier League’s PSRs.\n\nWith questions also over where he would fit into Amorim’s system, a move could benefit all parties. It would provide a fresh start for Rashford and a financial boost to United.\n\n#### Antony\n\nThe winger has struggled to make an impact since his £82 million move from Ajax in the summer of 2022. It is reported that United have already made the decision to cash in when the January window opens.\n\nWhile they will struggle to get anywhere near the transfer fee that they paid just two-and-a-half years ago, a sale could add to the funds available for Amorim. Finding a buyer willing to complete a permanent deal, as opposed to a loan, could however be a challenge.\n\n### Sign up to get even more from our Man United coverage\n\nWe want your views, Reds.

      "article_text": "Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\nFew figures who have left the Manchester United dugout since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement have been serenaded by the Stretford End in their last game.\nEven ever-popular Ole Gunnar Solskjaer witnessed a toxic end to his tenure at Vicarage Road albeit he has managed to redeem himself with the fanbase. And yet, Ruud van Nistelrooy managed it as his time at Old Trafford came to an end before the international break with a comfortable victory over Leicester City.\nThe next day, the Dutchman left United for good as Ruben Amorim welcomed his own backroom staff to the club. While it was disappointing to see Van Nistelrooy leave, it is clear that he deserved more than an advisory role at United should he have stayed for the Amorim premiership and thus he jumped quickly into the process of finding a new job.\nPerhaps the biggest currently available job in the United Kingdom is in the Midlands where Coventry City controversially parted ways with Mark Robins at the beginning of the month. Robins once scored the goal that arguably saved Ferguson's career at Old Trafford and it would have been fitting to see one ex-United striker be replaced by another.\nHowever, it is not just sentimentality that points us to this solution. Van Nistelrooy came to United in the summer after an impressive managerial stint at PSV Eindhoven and it is clear the Reds' disheartened squad responded to the Dutchman's tactics during his brief interim role.\nBut despite this, it looks almost certain that Coventry will overlook him in favour of Frank Lampard. The former Chelsea man enjoyed a good spell at Derby County as a manager but that is five years ago now.\nSince then, he has returned to Stamford Bridge twice for two poor spells and was mediocre at best with Everton albeit he did help them to survive in the Premier League. From a Sky Blues perspective it is an underwhelming appointment should it be confirmed.\nWith a trio of bad tenures under his belt, Lampard represents a huge risk for the Coventry boardroom particularly if, as their supporters fear, he has been brought in because he is a big name. Van Nistelrooy could have also provided that while also giving fans a coach who is coming in on a high.\nCoventry seems to have committed yet another error in what has been a bad month for the club and their ownership could live to regret overlooking Van Nistelrooy."

      "article_text": "**Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.**\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.sportbible.com/kobbie-mainoo) and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed [a handful of details in the training session](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/ruben-amorim-training-session-luke-shaw-kobbie-mainoo-283978-20241119). Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while [Luke Shaw](https://www.sportbible.com/luke-shaw) was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert [**Fabrizio Romano**](https://x.com/fabrizioromano/status/1859508798802575382?s=46&t=uxXCWj4CwoDO3TqegCIzVA) has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on [**X**](https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1859508798802575382), formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth\\\\s Milos Kerkez and [Bayern Munich](https://www.sportbible.com/bayern-munich)'s Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”\n\nThoughts on United's options at left wing-back? Do they need to dip their toe in the transfer market?

It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\nRoy Keane, Gary Neville and Ian Wright react to Jude Bellingham's goal\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares."

      "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested as per Nottinghamshire Live - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained via Sport Witness.\n\n“I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, according to Sky Germany.\n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Welt, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That [amount] won't be enough,” Krosche said.\n\n“It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself.\n\nThat's an agreement we make with the players."

      "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Rúben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Rúben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited."

He is brilliant.\n    \n    **Ipswich's last league win over United came in 1994. Can the Tractor Boys ruin Ruben Amorim's first game in charge?**\n    \n    Confidence is high after the past two performances. I am slightly wary of calling a win, as you assume the United players will want to impress their new boss.\n    \n    I think as it is at Portman Road we can get a point, but we expect United to be up for it and to present a huge challenge.\n    \n    **Are you confident Ipswich will avoid relegation?**\n    \n    Hopeful rather than confident.\n    \n    We seem to be finding our feet, as the win at Spurs shows, but the odds are against us as a team that was in League One in recent memory.\n    \n    We will fight to the end and will not be daunted by any challenge, and McKenna's ability to improve players and maintain team spirit will be key.\n    \n    _Steve Mellen is the former editor of ITFC magazine Meet Me At Sir Alf, and also represented fanzine Those Were The Days_\n    \n4.  **Dale O'Donnell**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    _Here is what our Manchester United fan writer Dale O'Donnell had to say in response to questions from our Ipswich Town contributor Steve Mellen._\n    \n    **What are the expectations this season now Ruben Amorim is in post?**\n    \n    Amorim will be tasked with delivering on several fronts, but United fans are desperate to see an attractive playing style that showcases a sense of identity.\n    \n    We did not know which United would show up from one week to another under Erik ten Hag, and he lost his job for not winning enough football matches.\n    \n    **What was the biggest issue for you under Ten Hag?**\n    \n    The biggest issue in my eyes was how Ten Hag came from a successful Ajax side that played great football, and when he was unable to implement that system at United, he tried to make us a transitional team heavily reliant on the counter-attack.\n    \n    The Dutchman may be a shrewd tactician but he watched his midfield regularly get overrun.\n    \n    **With Oasis reforming do you wish it was the early '90s again with Fergie at the helm and United churning out great teams from their own youth system?**\n    \n    No, because I enjoy reminiscing about those times.\n    \n    The Class of '92 is not something any other English club has been able to replicate and can only be compared to the Busby Babes of the 1950s and 1960s. Our academy still produces the best young players in the country, as seen with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.\n    \n    As for Oasis, I hope their reformation means [Manchester City](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) go back to being rubbish.\n    \n    _Find more from Dale O'Donnell at_ [_Stretty News_, external](https://strettynews.com/)\n    \n5.

Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Ipswich are the only side without a Premier League win at home this season (P5 D3 L2). Only five newly promoted sides have failed to win any of their opening six home matches of a campaign in the division, and all five went on to be relegated.\n    \n    The Tractor Boys have had the fewest shots (108), shots on target (33), touches in the opposition's box (199) and expected goals (10.2) of any side in the 2024-25 Premier League.\n    \n    Meanwhile, Liam Delap has scored six of Town's 12 league goals this season, making him one of only three players to have scored at least half of his side's goals in the competition this term, alongside Erling Haaland of [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) (12 of 22) and [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) striker Chris Wood (eight out of 15).\n    \n10.  BBC Sport pundit Nedum Onuoha gives us his insight and opinion every fortnight on your Premier League club.\n    \n    But this week, he's in the hotseat for your questions.\n    \n    So what do you want to ask for a former player. Best opponent? Most memorable team-mate he played with?\n    \n    Or maybe you're just interested in what next for your club this season?\n    \n    [Send in your questions, external](https://modules.wearehearken.eu/bbc-sport/embed/47275/share)\n    \n11.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    We asked for one thing - good or bad - involving Ipswich that nobody is talking about but should be.\n    \n    Here are some of your comments:\n    \n    **Peter:** Whatever happens this year, the future looks brighter with the decision to upgrade the academy to category one shortly. Some quality homegrown players in the first team in a few years' time will please every fan and help Town remain competitive with the richer clubs.\n    \n    **Gareth:** Ipswich have won or drawn more games than they have lost. Keep improving week by week and maybe more of those invaluable wins come.\n    \n    **Fernando:** Why Leif Davis isn't in the England squad.\n    \n    **Tom:** The narrative in the media has been this 'awful start' that Ipswich have had, however, the least concerned have been Town fans. Watching them week in, week out, we have all seen that the results haven't matched the performances (bar a couple). Yes, it took a sub-par performance from [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur), but it's no surprise that we were competitive against them.\n    \n12.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    There has been some pressure on players carrying an injury going into international breaks with their national side because you are contracted to these clubs and that is where your income is.\n    \n    But, for me, as a player I had a similar [mindset to Harry Kane](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp8x4rvne86o) that I would always be available - injured or not injured. I would have injections when I was on international duty just so I could represent my country because it meant that much.\n    \n    It is difficult, however. If you look at Jack Grealish and [Pep Guardiola's comments,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvgknzd9gqwo) he has a point because the forward has not been able to play for Manchester City because of injuries. So if you have been sidelined for three or four games, I would agree that you are then not fit and available to go on international duty.\n    \n    But when you look at some of the other players, ones who have been playing and being managed by their club, then I do not see it being different to being played and managed by your country.\n    \n    From the club's side, when they are competing at such high levels in the Premier League, you can understand why they would want their players to be rested and get fully fit again over the two weeks, rather than having to come back straight into a hectic period of fixtures.\n    \n    I kind of get it from both points of view but, as a player, if I am half fit and being played by my club, I would be fully available for my national team.\n    \n    It is really difficult with the pressure that is on the players, though. I would not look at it as a decision players have made solely.\n    \n    _Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson_\n    \n13.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Out of the three promoted teams this season, Ipswich look like the most adaptable.\n    \n    Manager Kieran McKenna is able to identify what it is his team needs to change. We saw in the opening game against [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) that they were good and competed for a period of time before they ultimately lost that match.\n    \n    They are building and are slowly adapting. The players know they are Championship players that are growing within the league. It is credit to both the players and the manager at Ipswich that they are willing to adapt and find ways to see games through.\n    \n    They have had a lot of draws and games they perhaps should have won, but getting that first win and the manner in which they did it will be massive for them.\n    \n    Finding ways to win in the Premier League is difficult and they were able to do that in a game that myself and many others did not have them down to get anything from. That shows growth. As a manager, it showed McKenna was willing to adapt and in the top flight - that is important.\n    \n    This could become the blueprint now for their season. They have been close to getting a result like this but had not been able to see games out, so when you get that first win it relieves that bit of pressure.\n    \n    Ipswich will know they are going to be in a dogfight until the end of the season, but the player-manager relationship looks really good from the outside while the fans are on board and have been fantastic.\n    \n    Everybody in the club is connected and on the same page. That really does help.\n    \n    _Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson_\n    \n14.

Everyone was saying the wheels were going to fall off at some point, but they were just relentless.\n    \n    \"I love the belief they have in their squad. They scored so many late goals in that season last year and even when they were 2-0 or 2-1 down, they managed to get a result or go on and win the game, which is so important to have that sort of mentality.\n    \n    \"I think he \\[Kieran McKenna\\] has done a tremendous job there and now they're just starting to find their feet and they are putting in some good performances now. I'm sure that will continue and they will pick up results now, which will go a long way as the season goes on.\"\n    \n    Having taken a 2-0 lead, Ipswich held off a late Spurs rally to secure their first Premier League victory for 22 years.\n    \n    \"That's part of their maturity in this division because a lot of these players are doing it for the first time,\" added Onuoha.\n    \n    \"We're seeing players like Liam Delap get headlines for the goals he's scoring - and they should be spoken about - but if they want to stay up, it's got to be about the collective.\"\n    \n16.  \n17.  **Henry Brownsey**  \n    BBC Sport journalist\n    \n    There were plenty of memorable numbers across the weekend's Premier League football...\n    \n    1 - How many games it took Brighton's Matt O'Riley to open his account in the top flight.\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    250 - How many appearances Bruno Fernandes has now made for Manchester United, registering a combined 155 goals and assists in this time.\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    4 - Consecutive defeats for Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side, and the first time he has had such a losing run in his managerial career.\n    \n    28 - Points Liverpool boss Arne Slot has earned in the Premier League in his first 11 games in charge - the joint-most of any new manager.\n    \n    80 - Seconds between Bournemouth going 2-1 up and Mikkel Damsgaard equalising for Brentford.\n    \n    1:48 - How long into the game Pablo Sarabia put Wolves ahead against Southampton - becoming the club's earliest Premier League goalscorer.\n    \n    22 years, six months, two weeks and three days - The amount of time Ipswich Town had gone without a Premier League victory before Sunday's win at Tottenham.\n    \n18.  Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    Ipswich Town legend George Burley says he is \"feeling well\" after his initial treatment for cancer.\n    \n    The former Scotland manager [issued a statement through his former club](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgl2r4k8zewo) in September to share the news of his diagnosis of an undisclosed form of the disease.\n    \n    In an interview with BBC Radio Suffolk, he said he had had chemotherapy and was awaiting details of the next stage of treatment, adding: \"It's one step at a time, but at the moment I’m feeling well.\"\n    \n    Burley said although it had been a \"difficult time\", he was trying to keep lively and fit as well as focussing on eating healthily.\n    \n    He had also been able to return to playing golf and had attended every Ipswich home game this season.\n    \n    The 68-year-old played for Ipswich from 1973 to 1985, making more than 500 appearances, before managing the side between 1994 and 2002 and was in charge the last time they were in the top flight.\n    \n    Burley said he had received support locally and from figures in the game, including text messages from some current Ipswich players and boss Kieran McKenna.\n    \n    He said he had also been heartened by the Tractor Boys' form, especially their 2-1 win at [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) at the weekend.\n    \n    \"Their performances have been excellent,\" Burley said.\n    \n    \"It's about making good performances and I haven't been panicking because the team have been playing really well and there's improvement every week.\n    \n    \"I've got every confidence that we get to stay in the Premier League this season.\"\n    \n    [Listen to the full interview from 38'20 on BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jzcbw4)\n    \n19.  \n20.  **Seb Brown**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    As the full-time whistle sounded at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the joy and elation from the away end released 22 years of hurt.\n    \n    The last time Ipswich Town won a game in the Premier League was in April 2002 at home to Middlesbrough.\n    \n    The journey the fans have been on since has had many more downs than ups, but Sunday's result was another tick on the long list of recent achievements to bring the club back to where many think it rightfully belongs.\n    \n    Following [Wolves'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/wolverhampton-wanderers) victory over [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) on Saturday, Ipswich found themselves with the unenviable record of being the only side in England's top four divisions to be without a win this season.\n    \n    With a daunting trip to Spurs, followed by an international break, even the most optimistic of Town fans would have thought the chances of a zero remaining in the win column until nearly December was almost certain.\n    \n    Sunday's victory was the latest example of how the team has continuously evolved this season when playing away.\n    \n    Two weeks previously, Town had also taken a 2-0 lead away from home, in London, in a stadium in which they had never played before. That game however was 2-2 by half-time, with [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) running out eventual 4-3 winners with a 96th-minute goal.\n    \n    Sunday had some parallels with the Brentford game but, crucially, some vital differences.\n    \n    This time Town were able to weather the storm in the immediate aftermath of half-time, when Spurs came out fired up. Even when Tottenham pulled a goal back, the concerns among the away fans were proven to be incorrect as the game was seen out relatively comfortably.\n    \n    Eight points from 11 games is a great return and, more crucially, we are up to 17th position.\n    \n    Bring on [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) in two weeks' time!\n    \n    _Find more from Seb Brown at the_ [_Blue Monday Podcast_, external](https://bluemondayitfc.co.uk/)"

Alex McCarthy will deputise for Ramsdale and Martin has \"so much trust\" in him to perform.\n*   Martin said everyone at Saints is \"immensely proud\" of Taylor Harwood-Bellis after the defender scored on his England debut last weekend: \"The aim when he came in last year in the Championship - and he was disappointed not to be in the Premier League at that point - was to get there together and give him the best chance of achieving his dream of international football.\"\n*   Martin said the club met with [refereeing body] PGMOL to discuss two contentious decisions in the defeat by Wolves before the international break. He said he \"still has issues\" with Ryan Manning's disallowed effort and a potential foul for Wolves' second goal, as well as the match review panel concluding the decisions made were correct.\n*   But he added: \"It's happened - it is what it is. [Howard Webb] accepted a lot of our points and we had to accept a lot of his, because it's not easy. But I think it was important for us to have a chat.\"\n*   On a busy spell of fixtures coming up: \"We showed the guys the table how it looked at this point last season, and how much it changed by the end of December. It's such an exciting month. People talk about the difficulty of the games and the level of competition we face in the next four or five games, but it's what we've worked so hard for and we should be excited about the challenge.\"\n*   He is therefore not intimidated by daunting games on the schedule: \"Teams have shown in recent weeks that you can pick up big results against big teams and good opposition. We're going to have to at some point if we're going to achieve what we want to achieve.\"\n*   The Southampton boss said Liverpool are \"the best team in the country at the moment on current form\" and on Arne Slot's start as boss, he added: \"When you go into a club that's built on something for so long with top players that have bought into that, he hasn't changed too much. It's the best management at that point to continue some of the brilliant things they were good at, and put his own spin on it, which he has done.\n\nTaylor Harwood-Bellis has said his attention has quickly returned to Southampton's position in the Premier League, following a goal on his senior England debut against Republic of Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nThe 22-year-old told BBC Radio Solent: \"I'm not too bad at changing focus. People have asked me about it at home and England is not something I want to talk about too much now.\n\n\"We've got a job to do in the league. Me scoring for England has not hidden the fact that we're bottom of the league and we've got a big game on Sunday [against Liverpool].\"\n\nHarwood-Bellis added that he has been on the wrong end of some light-hearted banter with his team-mates following his international exploits.\n\n\"They give me a bit of stick whenever I mention it - they set me up and then when I start, they hammer me for mentioning it,\" joked the former Manchester City centre-back.\n\nFormer Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy is keen to stay in the Premier League amid potential managerial opportunities at Southampton, Wolves and Crystal Palace.\n\nSouthampton, Brighton and Ipswich are considering a move for Vasco de Gama's Brazilian forward Rayan, 18, in January.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal are considering a move for Saints midfielder Shea Charles, who has impressed on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nSouthampton have registered an interest in 18-year-old Real Madrid and Brazil striker Endrick, alongside Roma and Real Valladolid."

Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    **BBC Sport pundit Nedum Onuoha gives us his insight and opinion every fortnight on your Premier League club but this week he's in the hotseat answering your questions.**\n    \n    **Dan asked:** The players and coaching staff have stayed united despite a very bad run of form since about March. Do you think this will be what’s needed to stay up by keeping things consistent, or will it lead us to a delusional relegation if things don’t change?\n    \n    **Nedum replied:** That is a great question. A sense of unity will always give you a chance, especially when people are all pulling in the same direction. At times you can fall out of form but that's when you really see what the clubs are like.\n    \n    Other teams who have faced similar have found themselves with in-team fighting and falling-outs - but that doesn't seem to be the case at Wolves. They are not in crisis.\n    \n    So, because of that, I don't think the team and staff are being delusional. Sometimes you just need belief because you know you have the quality and that might have come from their first win of the season over [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton).\n    \n    Harmony through disappointment is so important because it shows they are happy to work hard to break the situation they are in now. That is what makes a difference.\n    \n    _Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford_\n    \n\n3.  Former [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy is keen to stay in the Premier League amid potential managerial opportunities at Wolves, [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) and [Crystal Palace](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace). [(Football Insider), external](https://www.footballinsider247.com/ruud-van-nistelrooy-ready-to-accept-job-amid-southampton-sack-latest/)\n    \n    [Want more transfer stories? Read Thursday's full gossip column](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cyv7298194jo)\n    \n4.  **Mike Taylor**  \n    BBC Radio WM reporter\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    When Raul Jimenez left Wolves, there was great mutual affection between him and the fans, and some sadness that his best days appeared to have been cut short in such an unfortunate way.\n    \n    He really had been a fine attacking leader in the best period of Wolves' recent history and was a popular, genial figure. It was hard for everyone, and no doubt hardest for Raul himself, that after all his struggles to recover from his dreadful head injury in November 2020, his peak form would not return.\n    \n    It was therefore greatly uplifting watching [Fulham's](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) recent game against [Aston Villa](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa), to find that the peak-Jimenez was back - rattling defenders, racing onto chances and, most of all, obviously relishing the contest. Those who cheered him in his Wolves days will be thrilled for him too, but this week are probably queasy at the idea he might prove to be a very challenging opponent on Saturday.\n    \n    Wolves took a long time to adequately replace him. There have been some failed auditions and some alternative approaches. Matheus Cunha has turned out to be a fine player, but not best as a number nine. Sasa Kalajdzic might have been the answer but suffered dreadful luck. Diego Costa was fun, but only ever passing through.\n    \n    At last, to some relief, Wolves signed Jorgen Strand Larsen last summer. Tall and strongly built, with a promising record and a similarly affable manner to Jimenez - he looks the part.\n    \n    It has not been an easy start in a struggling team - admittedly not one struggling to score goals. Larsen has plugged away willingly, although it has sometimes seemed like a lonely trudge, and he has often left the scene midway through the second half, visibly spent. Still, four goals is not a bad return in a team near the bottom, and his hard yards will have eased the physical pressure on others, perhaps Cunha most.\n    \n    This weekend's game at Fulham offers the chance of a direct comparison, although a slight distraction from the main story. The key issue from the first part of the season is that Wolves' leaky defence will sink them unless the holes are plugged.\n    \n    They held firm against [Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) for a long-awaited clean sheet, despite - as Gary O'Neil explained - Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno labouring through with injuries. Patched up or not, if they can hold off the resurgent Jimenez and company this weekend, things may be looking up.\n    \n    [Listen to full commentary of Fulham v Wolves at 15:00 GMT on Saturday on BBC Radio WM (96.6 FM)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_wm)\n    \n    Tune into [The West Midlands Football Phone-In](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p001g9px) from 18:00 on weeknights\n    \n5.

The forward has also netted in his past three away league games.\n    \n6.  **Dazzling Dave**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    In July, when Wolves acquired Jorgen Strand Larsen, sporting director Matt Hobbs expressed his ambition for the team to target the European competition spots.\n    \n    Fast forward to today, and Wolves find themselves far from realising that goal.\n    \n    Despite outscoring fifth-placed [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) this season, Wolves are anchored to the bottom of the table.\n    \n    Inconsistencies in defence have hindered Gary O'Neil's efforts to build a cohesive team. According to WhoScored, Wolves are the league's biggest under-performers for xG against - conceding 27 goals versus an expected 22.41, a discrepancy of 4.59.\n    \n    Their attack tells a different story, with Wolves scoring 16 goals compared to an expected 12.88 - surpassing expectations by 3.12 goals, the highest attacking over-performance in the division.\n    \n    At the heart of Wolves' attack is Matheus Cunha, a beacon of hope for O'Neil. Cunha has a remarkable ability to turn the mundane into the spectacular, having scored five goals and provided two assists so far this season.\n    \n    He has been instrumental in nearly half of Wolves' goals this season, but his impact goes beyond statistics.\n    \n    With 23 goal contributions in his last 28 Premier League starts, he stands among the elite and he is only surpassed in consistency by six players from top-six teams. His shot rate of 3.2 per 90 minutes even surpasses notable players like Mohamed Salah and Ollie Watkins.\n    \n    Without Cunha, Wolves' offence would lack potency and direction.\n    \n    We have to ask: is it O'Neil's tactical nous shaping results or the sheer talent of individuals like Cunha?\n    \n    O'Neil, once lauded for his tactical acumen on Monday Night Football, now faces a formidable test with Wolves.\n    \n    While his attacking unit shows promise, defensive frailties undermine their efforts. Vulnerabilities at set-pieces and open play offer openings that opponents readily exploit.\n    \n    Though Wolves possess the core of a solid mid-table team, defensive improvements are essential or O'Neil's tactics may prove ineffective.\n    \n    While the squad boasts many talented individuals, survival in the Premier League depends heavily on Cunha's continued performance. Any injury or transfer involving Cunha could significantly diminish Wolves' chances of retaining their league status.\n    \n    _Find more from Dazzling Dave at_ [_Always Wolves_, external](https://alwayswolves.co.uk/)\n    \n7.

I would have injections when I was on international duty just so I could represent my country because it meant that much.\n    \n    It is difficult, however. If you look at Jack Grealish and [Pep Guardiola's comments,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cvgknzd9gqwo) he has a point because the forward has not been able to play for Manchester City because of injuries. So if you have been sidelined for three or four games, I would agree that you are then not fit and available to go on international duty.\n    \n    But when you look at some of the other players, ones who have been playing and being managed by their club, then I do not see it being different to being played and managed by your country.\n    \n    From the club's side, when they are competing at such high levels in the Premier League, you can understand why they would want their players to be rested and get fully fit again over the two weeks, rather than having to come back straight into a hectic period of fixtures.\n    \n    I kind of get it from both points of view but, as a player, if I am half fit and being played by my club, I would be fully available for my national team.\n    \n    It is really difficult with the pressure that is on the players, though.

With Johnstone out injured, he returned to the line-up against [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on 20 October and made a string of fine saves in a 2-1 defeat.\n    \n    He has played in each of the past four games, but who Wolves' starting goalkeeper will be moving forward will likely be on the agenda again following fit-again Johnstone's return to the bench against Southampton.\n    \n13.  **Mike Taylor**  \n    BBC Radio WM reporter\n    \n    Image source, Getty Images\n    \n    \"I understand the crowd,\" said Wolves captain Mario Lemina on Saturday. \"But we know our manager.\"\n    \n    Results and the calendar appeared to be conspiring against Gary O'Neil. Failure to win the final game before the November break - the last until the spring - would have stress-tested Wolves' resolve to keep him, perhaps to breaking point.\n    \n    We will never know now, or not for a few weeks at least.\n    \n    The conditions for change were clear, but one factor so common to these situations was missing. Sometimes with struggling teams, suspicions that players have lost faith in the coach seem too obvious to ignore. Not always a lack of effort, but a sensed lack of conviction, and often there is one game when everything unravels.\n    \n    It has not happened. There have been plenty of faults to spot - especially defensively - but it has never appeared that the players have given up on their work, or on O'Neil. It has always felt as if they care.\n    \n    There has been despair and emotion from the players, but even at the darkest stage of the past few months, when they were being taken apart at [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford), Wolves still kept pushing enough to score the last goal of the game. They have shown the will, but not found the means.\n    \n    Not until Saturday, anyway.\n    \n    The early goal helped enormously, but soon afterwards, it was hard to claim that it had settled the nerves. After half-time, though, they adjusted and seemed settled. They certainly were after Matheus Cunha's fine shot.\n    \n    It had not all been enjoyable, but - in the circumstances of the day - once Wolves had scored, the only two words that mattered were \"[Southampton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) nil\". Better performances will need to follow, but this game had to be won first, by any means.\n    \n    Lemina has faith and is happy to share it: \"We know our manager is doing everything. Sometimes it's not about him - it's just about what we do on the pitch. Today showed he was a good tactical manager.\"\n    \n    Nevertheless, there is a section of supporters, voluble in public channels even after Saturday, who still feel that this is the time to change, with winter in mind.\n    \n    The idea that Wolves are now into an easy spell, after their demanding start, is a fallacy with [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) next. But for now, O'Neil seems to have the club's backing.\n    \n    Lemina says he certainly has support from the players.\n    \n    \"We have to stick together.

Just last week he didn't know what he was doing, and was told as much.\n    \n    Marmite pales into insignificance compared with this when it comes to splitting opinion.\n    \n    The pervading narrative is that O'Neil is still learning on the job - an unpolished diamond and one of the \"best young operators\" in the game, according to the board.\n    \n    His future, supposedly, is yet to have even been discussed, such is their faith.\n    \n    The reality is his youth and inexperience are dubious concepts. Mikel Arteta, Andoni Iraola, Enzo Maresca, Steve Cooper, Arne Slot, Kieran McKenna, Russell Martin and Ruben Amorim are all within five years of him either side, while Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler is a decade younger.\n    \n    Ultimately, he is among his peers.\n    \n    The adage \"it's the hope that kills you\" has taken on a new meaning: the higher-ups' high hopes for O'Neil feel like a punter who naively believes the \"free beer tomorrow\" sign chalked up behind the bar.\n    \n    And yet, despite unconvincing performances, results since [Brentford](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) have improved. Arguably, O’Neil has achieved only a point or two less than anyone could have in the four matches since.\n    \n    To survive long term, however, excuses must stop and philosophies must begin to show. Any side with a spine as strong as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Jorgen Strand Larsen, Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina and Santiago Bueno should not be languishing in the relegation zone and still without a distinct identity.\n    \n    From the shoots of that first win over [Southampton](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton), O'Neil must build this team in his image. How Wolves express themselves is a reflection of him: his beliefs, his ideologies, his principles.\n    \n    At the moment, that screams uncertainty. We look a side lacking conviction and confidence, riddled with fragility, fear and self-doubt, and on the brink of collapse.\n    \n    Tetchy. Much like our manager.\n    \n    The noise surrounding him is loud and the fanbase reactive (which can work both ways), but O’Neil's biggest challenge is undoubtedly - among the chaos - to find himself.\n    \n    Firefighting will not suffice.\n    \n    _Find more from George at_ [_Always Wolves_, external](https://alwayswolves.co.uk/)\n    \n16.

The three points were important, but the performance again was poor. With the quality of players we have, it is hard to argue against a better manager getting much more out of this squad.\n    \n    **Phil answered:** Time will tell on the long term but there is no doubt that was a huge result for O'Neil and Wolves. It was all about the win on Saturday - the substance, not the style.\n    \n    It is clear the club want to stick by him and admire him but a loss to Southampton at home would have ratcheted up the pressure, which is why it was portrayed in many quarters as a must-win game.\n    \n    In mitigation, O'Neil did lose some important players such as Max Kilman and Pedro Neto in the summer, as well as having a tough opening spell of fixtures. The club clearly showed its faith with a new four-year contract in the summer.\n    \n    This vital win against Southampton now has to be the platform for improvement for Wolves and O'Neil because they are still in a precarious position.\n    \n17.

Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nThe 20-year-old could also thrive in one of the two No.10 roles behind a central striker even if there is plenty of competition for places with the likes of skipper Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford, Joshua Zirkzee, Mount and Amad all perhaps eyeing one of those spots.\n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n**Rashford up top**\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line.\n\nHe has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nRasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible.\n\nIn his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte.\n\nBut in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again."

        "article_text": "Sporting braced for Manchester United transfer raid on 17-year-old star - Manchester Evening News\nGeovany Quenda was one of the last success stories under Ruben Amorim at Sporting before he moved to Man United.\n\nQuenda is a starter for Sporting at the age of 17\nSporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United on February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side."

        "article_text": "Kone was substituted last week.\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen."

There are just six weeks until the January transfer window reopens in the new year, which will give Amorim plenty of time to figure out whether he reinforcements will be needed.\n\nAfter spending more than £200million on transfers last summer, United could have a more restricted budget to operate with this time around.

The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\n\"His body language under Erik ten Hag was not of a player who enjoyed playing and those were not good signs, he needs to buy into the new system because if he doesn’t he will be moved on by Amorim. It’s up to both the player and the manager but predominantly Rashford, he’s on huge money but sometimes that isn’t enough motivation. When I was working at United, the big intrinsic motivation was one, to play for Manchester United and number two, to be successful at Manchester United. It was all about winning.\n\n\"It's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. That is already a coping mechanism to deal with when things are not going that well. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\"\n\n(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\n\n22:09Bruna Reis\n\n### Manchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani (Image: Getty Images)\n\n21:33Bruna Reis\n\n### Man United discover 'big problem' that could cost £55m if Ruben Amorim can't find solution\n\nRuben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing such a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on. I don't know who buys him at the moment. It will be interesting to see how he performs under Amorim, certainly something to keep an eye on.\"\n\n**[Read more here.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-discover-big-problem-30423092)**\n\nRuben Amorim takes charge of his first Manchester United game this weekend.

The Turkey international has previously worked under Liverpool boss Arne Slot at Feyenoord.\n\nThe report adds that Liverpool could be in a stronger position to land him given the connection to the Dutch boss.\n\nOrkun Kokcu is well-known to Liverpool's scouting department\n\n20:27Bruna Reis\n\n### Jamie Carragher says what Ruben Amorim did in first week at Man United should excite supporters\n\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nFormer Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does 'not think this squad is suited to three at the back', he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way.\n\nI've been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,\" he told The Overlap US. \"He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?'\n\n\"And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change.’ But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n\"I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.\"\n\nRuben Amorim has been hard at work at Manchester United (Image: Ash Donelon)\n\n19:57Bruna Reis\n\n### Man United 'continue' monitoring Bayern Munich star\n\nFabrizio Romano has revealed that Man United 'will continue' monitoring Alphonso Davies as the left-back position is a department the club have reportedly made a priority.\n\nAs I told you, there is still no agreement done with any club.

We do not want to think about anything else but the next step, playing on Saturday.\n\nWhen quizzed about the transfer window reopening in less than six weeks, Matic has suggested he is keen to remain in France, adding: \"Everyone for sale? We need a team to play. This is the first time I've heard that everyone is for sale. I've never experienced that.

The striker was one of the signings requested by the former manager.\n\nThe report adds that Juve could be his next destination however, with manager Thiago Motta thought to be a fan of Zirkzee. Motta has previously worked with Zirkzee at Bologna.\n\nHe has struggled for form, having so far scored once in 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n18:36Bruna Reis\n\n### Ruud van Nistelrooy return timeline emerges after emotional Manchester United exit\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy is reportedly hopeful of landing a permanent manager's role in the Premier League after his emotional exit from Manchester United this month.\n\nThe 48-year-old was appointed as interim manager - after Erik ten Hag was sacked as manager - in October and oversaw three wins and one draw during his four games at the helm.

He is very happy to be here. What we want is to have him for as long as possible.\"\n\nGyokeres, who joined Sporting for a fee of around £20million, has already played down reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford.\n\nHe said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\n\n\"He [Amorim] probably already has strikers there. It's very sad that he left [Sporting], but of course, we understand the decision.

So Man United want to cover that position.\n\n\"This summer, they decided to go with Noussair Mazraoui, this was the plan.

Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\n\n\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also vowed he would score more goals with his right foot and told reporters he would show them \"his notes one day.\" Antony does not lack self belief - he wouldn't be at United without it - but he's failed to back up his words on the pitch, which is how he's judged.\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/antony-might-manchester-united-lifeline-30418441)\n\n16:08Bruna Reis\n\n### Man United receive transfer response\n\nUnited are reportedly leading the race for Rosenborg midfielder Sverre Nypan, according to reports.\n\nHowever, Give Me Sport has reported the 17-year-old is keen to secure first-team assurances before making a decision on potentially moving to Old Trafford in the coming months.\n\nHe is said to be valued in the region of £84million and has been compared to Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard.

All of his four Champions League appearances have been from the bench.\n\nThe 25-year-old is said to be a target for United, amid the possibility that Joshua Zirkzee leaves on loan in January to regain form after an unsettled start to his stay at Old Trafford.\n\nRandal Kolo Muani (Image: Getty Images)\n\n13:02Isaac Johnson\n\n### Porro camp 'expecting' Amorim approach\n\nReports in Spain claim the representatives of Tottenham defender Pedro Porro are 'convinced' that Ruben Amorim will make an approach for him next year.\n\nSpanish outlet AS suggests the pair still hold a great relationship from their time together at Sporting CP, when the right-back played 98 times under Amorim.\n\nPorro played as a wing-back under the 39-year-old in Lisbon and could therefore be a target for Amorim at United, the report claims.\n\nTottenham defender Pedro Porro (Image: Getty Images)\n\n12:35KEY EVENT\n\n### Sporting braced for United transfer raid on Quenda\n\nSporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid.\n\nGeovany Quenda is of interest of Manchester United (Image: David Martins)\n\n12:04Isaac Johnson\n\n### Zirkzee agent 'contacts' Juventus\n\nA report in Italy claims that Joshua Zirkzee's agent has contacted Juventus over a potential January move amid the striker's unsettled start to life at Unied.\n\nZirkzee only arrived from Bologna in the summer, being signed for £36.5m. He has struggled to adapt to English football, failing to score in his last 16 appearances since scoring on debut against Fulham.\n\nNow, Calciomercato says his agent, Kia Joorabchian, has been speaking with Juventus chief Cristiano Giuntoli about a winter loan back to Italy in a bid for the player to rediscover his form.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee has only scored one goal for Manchester United since his move from Bologna (Image: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\n\n11:23Isaac Johnson\n\n### Sane addresses future amid United links\n\nUnited have been tentatively linked with a potential move for Leroy Sane amid reports the German is looking to leave Bayern next summer.\n\nThe winger has been backed for a return to the Premier League, and he has now opened up about what the future may hold for him.\n\nSpeaking to BILD, he said: “I have confidence in myself, in the situation and also in my club. We are in a transparent and relaxed exchange.\n\n“I will definitely not sign for another club on January 1 or 2. I don’t need a quick decision. I have a sympathy for the Premier League, I still watch certain games on TV.\n\n\"The attraction for me lies in the club where I can show my best performance, develop and win titles.

Statistics-wise, he has tallied three goals and two assists in 10 matches thus far.\n\n\"He is among the best signings of the last summer,\" Zola told Corriere dello Sport. \"Here in England, they can’t understand how Man United could let him go.

However, the latter has struggled to make an impact in England since his £36.5million move from Bologna.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer. During the recent international break, Kolo Muani remained adamant at breaking into Luis Enrique's XI.\n\n\"You have to keep your mental strength up, it's up to me to continue working so that the coach trusts me,\" he told Telefoot. \"It's part of my history. I've always worked, I've never had things easy.\n\n\"I have to work harder, make an impression when he calls on me. It's up to me to give my all so that he trusts me.\"\n"

After scoring on his United debut against Fulham on the opening day of the Premier League season, Zirkzee has failed to find the back of the net.\n\nSince Erik ten Hag has left the club, reports have emerged claiming the Dutchman was not overly sold on the striker. Now, with Ruben Amorim in charge, Zirkzee has an opportunity to live up to the expectations around his signing.\n\nHowever, reports in Italy are now saying the 23-year-old has asked to leave the club in the January transfer window. Calciomercato previously linked the striker with a return to Italy and they have followed that up by insisting Zirkzee is unhappy at United and is 'seriously considering' leaving.\n\nThe report states that Zirkzee has instructed his agent to find him another move in the winter with Juventus a potential destination. Managed by Thiago Motta, who Zirkzee built up a great relationship with at Bologna, the Old Lady are said to be considering their options in attack should Dusan Vlahovic depart.\n\nA move away from Old Trafford for Zirkzee would add more fuel to the fire concerning Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting CP star is a man in-demand due to his terrific goalscoring record in Portugal, though a potential £63m move isn't expected to be possible until the summer."

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing such a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nIn fact, Rashford's last appearance for the Three Lions was back in March, where he was given a mere cameo off the bench in a friendly against Brazil. So, he'll be hoping to transform his fortunes, starting this weekend when Amorim leads United out for the very first time.\n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on.\n\n\"I don't know who buys him at the moment. It will be interesting to see how he performs under Amorim, certainly something to keep an eye on.\"\n\nAccording to Capology, Rashford currently earns £15.6m a year at United, making him the joint-second highest paid player alongside Bruno Fernandes behind Casemiro. So, with three and a half seasons remaining – and approximately £54.6m left to be paid out – on his deal, higher-ups will be hoping Amorim can help the club get a much greater value for their money."

The 29-year-old, who beat teenage sensation Luke Littler to become the champion of the world for the first time back in January, was pictured alongside the likes of Roy Keane and Gary Neville.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Humphries, the current darting world number one, shared six separate images of him in The Overlap studio with \"some of the best footballers to have played the game\". The first photo showed Humphries alongside Keane, Jill Scott and Ian Wright, while Neville, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and comedian Michael McIntyre featured in some of the other shots.\n\nHumphries, who boasts 231,000 followers, said: \"Had a great time filming on the @wearetheoverlap today with some of the best footballers to have played the game,\" followed by a fist pumping emoji and the football emoji. \"Was a great laugh and enjoyed the experience,\" accompanied with the smiling face emoji.\n\nKeane's appearance - even holding a set of darts in one photo - comes a matter of months since he appeared to downplay the difficulty of the sport. During a conversation while working at Euro 2024 in Germany, Keane replied in typical fashion after Ian Wright labelled darts as \"magnificent\".\n\n\"It's all about practice. We could all become darts players if we practiced,\" Keane said.\n\nWright noted the 2023 World Championship final when Michael Smith and Michael van Gerwen as a memorable moment. \"It's magnificent is the darts,\" Wright said.\n\n\"It is a bit rowdy but to watch that... Like remember last year when they were both on for the nine darter! Watching that in the moment, it was watching perfection. Two guys at the very highest level, the peak of their performance, one of the most exciting things I've ever seen.\"\n\nAt the time, Neville, Scott and Wright then chose a nickname for Keane, who has been known for his downbeat and blunt nature. \"Roy 'the Killer' Keane,\" Neville suggested. \"Roy 'the Grumbler' Keane,\" Wright added."

        "headline": "Joshua Zirkzee Man United transfer latest: Italy return, January exit, Viktor Gyokeres impact",
        "article_text": "Joshua Zirkzee has endured a difficult start to his life at Manchester United. The Netherlands international has scored just one goal for the Red Devils since completing his summer move from Bologna.\n\nThe 23-year-old was in-demand after a terrific 2023/24 season in Italy. Zirkzee scored 12 goals to help Bologna qualify for the Champions League for the first time in their history.\n\nFollowing interest from Arsenal and AC Milan, United secured the striker's services for just over £36million. He arrived in July as Erik ten Hag's first signing of the summer but the move hasn't quite worked out yet.\n\nThe former Bayern Munich star has scored only one goal for United and has seen his minutes decrease since the return of Rasmus Hojlund. After coming off at half-time in the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham in September, Zirkzee has not started a game for United.\n\nRuben Amorim's appointment has led to speculation over the Dutchman's future at the club. So with that in mind, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest news on Zirkzee ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nAfter enjoying life in Italy with Bologna, Zirkzee has been tipped to secure a return to south Europe when the window reopens. Italian outlet Calciomercato have claimed that Juventus are considering a move.\n\nThiago Motta, who managed Zirkzee at Bologna, is said to be considering signing a new centre-forward amid uncertainty over Dusan Vlahovic's future.\n\nFollowing their report of Juventus' interest, Calciomercato reported this week Zirkzee has asked to leave the club when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\n\nThe report states that Zirkzee has instructed his agent to find him another move in the winter with Juventus a potential destination.\n\nNew United boss Amorim has already ruled out a transfer raid on former club Sporting CP in January but moves for their top players are expected to be considered at the end of the season.\n\nViktor Gyokeres is one player linked with following Amorim to Old Trafford and should Zirkzee be allowed to leave United, the Sweden international's services will likely be at the top of Dan Ashworth's list."

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim has three key Man United selection decisions to make as first task clear",
        "article_text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is beginning to settle into his new surroundings and there are already a number of key decisions to make ahead of his Premier League bow against Ipswich Town.\n\nTaking over during an international can have its positives, such as an extended period to implement new ideas, and negatives - including a depleted squad due to international involvement. For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad, fresh off the back of a busy summer of spending, but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s.\n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in their dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up, while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nThe United medical team will be keeping a close eye on the treatment table. In recent weeks Yoro returned to first-team training in recent weeks but United will have to monitor his workload after the summer signing picked up an injury during pre-season and has yet to play a competitive minute.\n\nEqually with Luke Shaw, who was stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks, after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.\n\nWith the excitement around Amorim's opening months in charge, a series of training pictures from sessions this week merely whet the appetite of the Old Trafford masses. There were sights of Mason Mount, Leny Yoro, Malacia and the welcome return of Kobbie Mainoo - as well as an opportunity for several youngsters to brush shoulders with the first-team."

        "article_text": "Erik ten Hag was spotted back in Manchester on Monday. The former Manchester United manager dined in an Italian restaurant and cleared out possessions from a nearby home.\n\nTen Hag oversaw the worst start to a Premier League campaign in United's history and was sacked following a controversial 2-1 defeat to West Ham at the London Stadium. The Dutchman's dismissal was confirmed on October 28 and he immediately returned to the Netherlands to spend time with his family.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis and United moved swiftly to appoint Ruben Amorim from Sporting Lisbon as Ten Hag's successor. Ten Hag was pictured in Hale exactly three weeks after his United departure. He dined in his regular haunt Piccolino and visited his residence to clear out his possessions.\n\nTen Hag was joined by his wife Bianca and the couple left the restaurant as the Manchester snow began on Monday night. A few days after he was sacked, Ten Hag watched Heracles in the Eredivisie and he also made a return to Ajax to watch another game before the international break.\n\nUnited triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract in the summer after clinching glory in the FA Cup final and he received a multi-million pay out following his sacking. Although the 54-year-old's intentions after leaving United aren't clear, there is expected to be interest in Ten Hag from European clubs and he is expected to return to management.\n\nTen Hag was spotted in Manchester on the same day as Amorim's first training session at Carrington. The 39-year-old was forced to wait until his visa was approved to coach on grass - he was allowed to hold meetings with staff - and took a session with nine senior players.\n\nAmorim's first game in charge of United will come against Ipswich Town this weekend and he must move United into the top half of the table, as they are currently 13th in the league.\n\nAfter Ten Hag's exit, the Dutchman wrote an emotional letter to United fans and said: \"Dear fans, Let me start by thanking you. Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable.\n\n\"The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents stadiums, whether the game was in England, Europe or during the summer tours.\n\n\"I always enjoyed meeting Manchester United fans throughout the world. Walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in England, Europe, Asia, Australia, the USA - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity. That's what makes United supporters so special.\n\n\"I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.\n\n\"We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end.\n\n\"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.\""

There are multiple senior players who are still away on international duty, meaning youngsters were needed to make up the numbers in Ruben Amorim's first training session. Among the academy players to be called up was Thwaites, who was also given the opportunity to train with the first-team by Erik ten Hag ahead of facing Brighton in August.\nThwaites is considered as one of the academy's leading prospects in his age group and won the club's Goal of the Season award for both Under-16 and Under-18 level last term. The youngster's great form has continued into this campaign and he recently scored a stunning free-kick.\nThwaites has contributed four goals and two assists in just three starts - he has made a total of nine appearances - for the U18s and has spent some time with the U16 group. He was expected to be given a prominent role in Adam Lawrence's U18 side this season and he's gone from strength to strength, making an appearance in every U18 league game. Different sources have suggested Thwaites has slightly gone under the radar in the conversation about emerging prospects and the youngster has been tipped to have a bright future.\nThwaites was the second 16-year-old to be involved in Amorim's first training session, as imposing defender Godwill Kukonki also took part, which was a huge milestone in his career.\n\n**Senior players involved:**\nTom Heaton, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro, Amad, Antony, Marcus Rashford."

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim might be about to change Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United plan",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim might be about to change Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United plan - George Smith - Manchester Evening News\nBruno Fernandes is likely to play a key part in Ruben Amorim's thinking at Man United - but his role could be a lot different to what he had previously envisioned.\nSuspended for Portugal's final game of their UEFA Nations League campaign on Monday night, Ruben Amorim must have welcomed Roberto Martinez's decision to release Bruno Fernandes from international duty early.\nThe Manchester United captain earned his second yellow card of the campaign in Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland on Friday night as they secured their position at the top of Group A1 with a game to spare, ruling him out of the trip to Croatia. As a result of clinching top spot, Portugal boss Martinez made the decision to release a handful of players from his squad early, no doubt to the delight of their respective clubs.\nMartinez's decision has means Fernandes is set for more time on the training ground ahead of Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town. The trip to Portman Road will mark the beginning of a new era at United, with new head coach Amorim taking charge for the very first time.\nThe recent arrival of the 39-year-old has given everyone associated with United a much-needed lift, not least the supporters, who are eager to see how the former Sporting Lisbon boss will take the club forward. Although Amorim refused to get bogged down in the topic of formations during his first interview as United boss, the expectation is that he will unleash a new-look 3-4-3 system from the off. It was the bedrock of much of his success at Sporting.\nThe prospect of United starting with a brand-new shape at Portman Road is attracting plenty of intrigue ahead of Amorim's debut in the dugout. Under Erik ten Hag, United very rarely lined up in anything other than a 4-3-3.\nThe switch to a system featuring wing-backs means Fernandes is expected to be dragged out of midfield and operate in the front-three. The general expectation is that he will start in an inverted wide role. The prospect of Amorim making that decision will represent a complete contrast to the role Fernandes envisions making his own in years to come. So often reliable wherever he plays, Fernandes earlier this year admitted that he expects to become a No.6 as his career continues to evolve.\n\"I have played, however, especially last season with coach Ten Hag, deeper,\" said Fernandes, speaking in March. \"In fact, against Everton, I played No.6 and I still think it was one of the most complete games I've played, at all levels.\n\"In terms of passing, game organisation, defence, tactics. I have a little thought in my head that I'm going to end my career further back, because everyone who started there and went to No.10 ended up retreating on the field at the end.\n\"It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.\n\"The game with Everton was the one in which I created the most scoring opportunities, even though I was playing deeper and not playing as a No.10.\"\nRegarded as United's most creative midfielder, there is little chance of Fernandes occupying one of the two natural midfield roles in Amorim's preferred formation. They are likely to be reserved by Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo, who are more defensively astute than Fernandes.\nFernandes never shirked away from the challenge of occasionally being deployed out wide under Ten Hag, often excelling because of his versatility and excellent tactical awareness. With United's width under Amorim expected to be supplied by the wing-backs, Fernandes' 'wide role' could actually be very subtle."

Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.\n\nOf the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.\n\n**READ MORE: [Only one United centre half is certain of staying next season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/only-one-manchester-united-centre-28328724)**\n\n**READ MORE: [Eight United players face an uncertain winter transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/eight-manchester-united-players-facing-28324556)**\n\nDe Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.\n\nAs costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.\n\nThat last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.\n\nThere are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.\n\nOnly one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.\n\nThe difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.\n\nTen Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.\n\nThere is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.\n\nPotter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.\n\nPotter is not a credible threat to Ten Hag for now.\n\nFan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.\n\nUnited bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.\n\nHalf-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.\n\nThat was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off."

A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.\n\nBlanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday."

Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.\n\nThe 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, [Darren](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher). The [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.\n\n**READ MORE: [Ratcliffe is already giving United something the Glazers never did](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-already-giving-28446191)**\n\n**READ MORE: [United insert buy-back clause into Mejbri contract](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-insert-buy-back-28446479)**\n\nThe Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.\n\nJack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nIt was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.\n\nFletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.\n\nIf Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\n  \n\nWhich is which? Jack (far left) and Tyler (far right) line up in Istanbul\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\n  \n\nA 16-year-old Darren Fletcher at The Cliff in April 2000\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\n  \n\nFletcher in his United blazer at Swindon\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which."

        "headline": "Scoring 100 goals a season and sharing a Roy Keane trait - Dan Gore's United journey",
        "article_text": "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) debut.\n\nGore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.\n\n“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"\n\nGore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.\n\nHe trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.\n\nAlthough Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised [Wayne Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) and [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.\n\n\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the _Manchester Evening News_. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.\n\n\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.\n\n\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.\n\n  \n\n\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"\n\nGore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.\n\n\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.\n\n\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.\n\n\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\n\n  \n\nGore (centre, bottom row) with Burnley's academy.\n\nMike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.\n\n\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.\n\n\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.\n\n\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.\n\n\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"\n\nHargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.\n\n  \n\n\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.\n\n\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"\n\nThe burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.\n\n\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.\n\n\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.\n\n\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\n\n  \n\nGore playing for the academy in 2019.\n\nGore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.\n\n\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.\n\n\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\n\nHargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.\n\n\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.\n\n\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"\n\n  \n\nGore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. [Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dan-gore-man-united-fernandes-27802126) has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.\n\n\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.\n\n\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"\n\nHargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"\n\nGore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon."

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim can unleash a Manchester United partnership Erik ten Hag only used once vs Ipswich",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim can unleash a Manchester United partnership Erik ten Hag only used once vs Ipswich\n\nMan United head coach Ruben Amorim has been given a much-needed boost ahead of his first game in charge on Sunday.\n\nThe sight of Kobbie Mainoo back on the grass at the Carrington earlier this week was exactly what Manchester United's supporters wanted to see ahead of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge this weekend.\n\nThe academy graduate has been missing for more than a month through injury, last featuring in United's 0-0 draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park on October 6.\n\nMissing the last seven matches, the prospect of Mainoo being in contention for Amorim's debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon will be a welcome boost for the new Reds head coach.\n\nNext Tuesday will mark exactly a year to the day since Mainoo made his full Premier League debut for United, starring in their 3-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park. Deployed at the base of the midfield that afternoon, he produced an outstanding display.\n\nFrom that moment onwards, Mainoo became a staple in United's midfield, starting 23 of the their remaining 25 Premier League matches last season. He had gone from being a promising academy product to a first-team undroppable in the blink of an eye.\n\nAlthough Mainoo made his mark against Everton as a holding midfielder, it soon became apparent he was more comfortable getting on the ball and advancing. He is a forward-thinking player, capable of receiving the ball and looking to attack.\n\nAmid Casemiro's downfall last season, United went into the summer transfer window knowing they had to recruit a world-class defensive-midfielder to sit alongside Mainoo in the engine room. After several months of speculation, Manuel Ugarte joined the club from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day.\n\n\"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer,\" said sporting director Dan Ashworth. \"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.\n\n\"His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"\n\nSigning a player of Ugarte's profile was exactly what both United and Mainoo needed. The Uruguayan was expected to slot straight into United's first-choice midfield and become Mainoo's perfect partner.\n\nHowever, former United manager Erik ten Hag, who had made Ugarte his third-choice midfield signing during the summer, was not forthcoming when it came to giving the former Sporting Lisbon man an opportunity to make an early mark at Old Trafford. He featured just seven times under the Dutchman, making four starts.\n\nOf those four starts, it was only on one of them that he lined up alongside Mainoo in midfield. They both started the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 29, but Mainoo was substituted just before half-time with United both 1-0 down and a man down, following the sending off of Bruno Fernandes.\n\nIt was a forgettable afternoon, meaning it was hard to assess just how Ugarte and Mainoo could work in tandem.\n\nSince their last and only start together, a lot has changed at Old Trafford, of course. Ten Hag has been sacked and replaced by Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has spent several weeks out injured and Ugarte has earned more minutes as a starter.\n\nThe 23-year-old worked with Amorim at Sporting prior to his move to PSG in July 2023 and has made more appearances under the new United boss than any other coach during his senior career, meaning he is highly likely to become an important figure in his plans at United.\n\nUgarte, under former United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, formed a strong bond with Casemiro in midfield, but Mainoo's recent return to training means he could soon replace the Brazilian in the starting XI, forming Amorim's first-choice midfield next to Ugarte.\n\nOn paper, a midfield partnership of Ugarte and Mainoo offers a blend of defensive nous, ball retention and the opportunity to progress the ball. It is the midfield duo many United supporters anticipated becoming the club's first-choice partnership after Ugarte's August arrival.\n\nThe likelihood of Amorim installing a 3-4-3 formation means Fernandes, who previously operated as the most advanced midfielder in Ten Hag's preferred 4-3-3, is expected to be forced further forward, leaving two midfield spots up for grabs.\n\nUgarte is expected to bag one of them and Mainoo should claim the other once he is back up to full fitness, whether that be this weekend or a little further down the line. At the ages of 23 and 19, respectively, they should form United's midfield for the future."

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been taking Manchester United training this week and has been left unimpressed by a number of things at the club, including the size of the squad.\n\nManchester United boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly already identified which players will fit into his desired style of play and those who won't.\n\nHaving arrived last week, Amorim has spent this week training with his squad at Carrington and getting a feel for the club ahead of his first game in charge at the weekend against Ipswich Town. The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who comes with a high reputation, has repeatedly urged his players to increase their pace throughout the week as he aims to make an immediate impact, with reports stating he has been taken aback by the lack of speed and intensity in training sessions.\n\nAmorim plans to quickly implement his 3-4-3 system and it's understood that he already knows certain players won't be able to adapt to it, reports The Sun. His coaching staff and analysts are working hard to get the players up to speed with Amorim's set-up.\n\nThe 39-year-old's first game in charge will be against Ipswich Town on Sunday, where United are expected to showcase a new look under Amorim's guidance. Despite being surprised by certain aspects of training and some players, Amorim has also been impressed by the quality of others.\n\nDespite currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League following their worst ever start to a season, Amorim believes this does not accurately reflect where the team should be.\n\nDespite the significant investment in the squad, United are still not ready to compete for the title. Amorim has reportedly been forthright in his critique of the team's performance, which he believes has been subpar for over a decade.\n\nHe has apparently told his players that they have been 'living in Sir Alex Ferguson's shadow', unable to emulate his success. The last Premier League title was won under Ferguson in 2013, and Amorim feels that the team has failed to harness his spirit as a motivating force.\n\nA source told The Sun: 'He told them that top managers have not replicated Sir Alex's success because they have lived in his shadow, rather than getting their team to play with his spirit.'"

        "article_text": "Viktor Gyokeres has hinted at a potential exit from Sporting Clube de Portugal at the end of this season. The Swedish striker has become one of Europe's most coveted talents following his stellar performances with the Portuguese champions, netting 23 club goals in just 16 matches this season.\n\nDespite having a £83.5million (€100m) release clause in his contract, it is believed that Sporting president Frederico Varandas would entertain offers around £66m (€80m), provided Gyokeres remains with Sporting until the season concludes. This development is likely to pique the interest of some of Europe's top clubs and could spark a fierce battle for his signature next summer.\n\nFollowing Manchester United's recent appointment of Gyokeres' former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, they are considered one of the favourites to secure Gyokeres. Amorim and Gyokeres shared a strong bond during their time together in Lisbon.\n\nGiven United's current struggles for goals in the Premier League this season, they are in desperate need of a world-class finisher. Amorim, who will spend his initial six months at United assessing the squad, was informed when he left the Portuguese club last week that he wouldn't be permitted to approach them in the January transfer window and would have to wait until the summer.\n\nAmorim will also benefit from the substantial financial backing of United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Gyokeres was asked about a potential move. He said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course I want to finish the season at Sporting, I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future.\"\n\nThe prolific Sweden international then teased that a move away from Sporting could happen, adding: \"We'll see when the time comes.\"\n\nWhen commenting on Amorim's switch to United, Gyokeres did not hide his emotions, stating: \"It's very sad that he left, but of course we understand the decision.\""

He would leave permanently in September 2019 to join Parma before eventually arriving at Inter where he remains to this day.\n\nWhile his time at United is seen as largely forgettable, despite winning the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup at Old Trafford, Darmian has now admitted that his spell in the Premier League opened him up to a new aspect of football. \"When I signed for Manchester United, I discovered that in England, during away games, family members don’t have a reserved section; they sit among the fans,\" he told Cronache di Spogliatoio.\n\n\"The first match was the derby against Liverpool. I told my girlfriend: ‘Look, it’s a very intense match.

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim guarantee could give Manchester United fans what they have been crying out for - Tyrone Marshall - Manchester Evening News\nRuben Amorim has started preparations for his first game as Man Utd head coach and has told fans what to expect at Portman Road.\n\nRuben Amorim has told United fans they quickly see his \"idea\" bought to life on the pitch.\n\nIn his first interview as Manchester United's head coach, Ruben Amorim kept returning to a couple of buzzwords that could define his early weeks at Old Trafford.\n\nDuring his chat with club media, he referred to his \"idea\" five times and discussed his team's \"identity\" six times. This was very clearly sending a message. There were no promises of results, but there was a guarantee that supporters would see a plan very quickly.\n\n\"I think you will see an idea. You could like it or not, I don't know, but you will see an idea. You will see a positioning. You will see something,\" Amorim said of the first impression his team will deliver.\n\n\"Something that we want to reach that kind of level. You will feel that. But we have to know that it's like two training \\[sessions\\] before the first match. This is the best league in the world. But if I have to say something to you, you will see an idea. This I can guarantee.\"\n\nThat alone will be music to the ears of United fans who became fed up watching a team without an identity. Erik ten Hag might have delivered two trophies to Old Trafford, but there was never a sense that he was building a side with a clear style of play.\n\nThey became a moments team, individuals producing a brilliant piece of play to create or score a goal and win a game. From the beginning of last season, very few 90-minute performances suggested a clear tactical plan being implemented by the whole team. United were too open, too easy to play against, and too vulnerable to teams set up creatively with a clear plan.\n\nAmorim clearly intends to change that. When Ten Hag held his first press conference, he said the players available to him would generally dictate the style of play. The new head coach intends to stick with his philosophy and his 3-4-3, with the players moulded to fit into that structure.\n\nIn some ways, the excitement around Amorim's first game at United is similar to that which greeted Jurgen Klopp's first as Liverpool boss. Again, the anticipation levels rose across an international break. Klopp sent out a team that pressed in a manner they hadn't done previously, and although the goalless draw at Tottenham was low on quality, it was a team that suggested he had a plan and would stick to it.\n\nUnited fans will be tuning in at Portman Road, expecting to see something similar. Amorim's teams are built on different principles, but pressing will be critical, as will the role and energy of his wing-backs. Who is picked to play in what position will also be fascinating.\n\nTwo training sessions with his entire squad won't be enough for Amorim to instil all of his ideas. Having taken over at the start of the busiest stretch of the season, it could be months before he looks at his team and believes they have definitely got it.\n\nBut if supporters can look at the side that plays Ipswich this weekend, then Bodo Glimt and Everton at Old Trafford, and see the outline of a plan and identity coming together, then they will be happy. It's been too long since a United team was clearly identifiable by its patterns of play and its philosophy on the pitch."

        "article_text": "But the long term reliability of United's two recognised left-backs has been called into question given they have had to operate without either player since February. As such, there is talk United could look to strengthen their options in that department and Benfica's Alvaro Fernandez Carreras has emerged as an option to return to the club.\n\nThe Spanish defender left Old Trafford to join the Portuguese giants for £6million in the summer and has quickly established himself as an important player at the Estadio Da Luz, despite some initial suspicion.\n\n\"With a mixture of cautious optimism and suspicion,\" Alfredo Fumacas of the Benfica Podcast told the Manchester Evening News when asked about the initial reception around Benfica when they signed the Spanish under-21 international.\n\n\"Alejandro Grimaldo who joined Benfica midseason during the 2015/16 season provided consistency to a position which, up until that point, was a bit of a revolving door between inconsistency and players who just weren't at the level required.\n\n\"Grimaldo was able to secure the starting spot, and remained a staple of championship Benfica teams for seven-and-a-half seasons. Following Grimaldo's departure toBayer Leverkusen, Benfica was again faced with the lack of quality at the left back position.\n\n\"When Carreras joined half way through the 2023/24 season there were a lot of questions in terms of his worth. Was he going to be more cannon fodder, like David Jurasek, and Mihailo Ristic before him?\n\n\"There was the connection to Man United, but the successive loan spells at Preston and Granada, left Benfica fans suspicious of his worth, but cautiously optimistic at the same time.\n\n\"Carreras has had an impressive ascent this season, and part of it has been due to [former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager] Bruno Lage's arrival after the sacking of Roger Schmidt. Lage's tactics and game idea suits Carreras' abilities.\n\n\"He has not only evolved under Lage, but he has also grown extremely confident with mounting good performances this early in the season. Lately he is being looked at as a proper Grimaldo replacement, and has made many of the fans forget the Leverkusen full-back.\"\n\nFernandez has featured in all 16 of Benfica's matches this season across the Primeira Liga, Champions League, Taca da Liga and Taca de Portugal and has gone from strength to strength. He was unable to force his way into United's plans during his time in Manchester but has quickly grown into an important player in Lisbon and he is already attracting transfer attention from a number of big European clubs.\n\nUnited inserted a €20million buyback clause into the deal to sell him and despite only leaving the club a matter of months ago, there is already concern in the Portuguese capital that he may return to Old Trafford.\n\n\"Of course there's concern from Benfica,\" Fumacas explained. \"Benfica initially brought in Carreras on a loan, but activated the buy clause of €6m in the beginning of the season, knowing that there was a buy back clause of €20m, at the time there were some questions from the fans in terms of his worth.\n\n\"I don't believe Benfica expected Carreras to rise up this quickly and to be on the radar of many European clubs, usually Benfica can keep suitors at bay with high release causes, but €20m will be a bargain for a 21-year-old with lots of potential.\"\n\nWith Amorim's budget said to be a little more limited to the transfer warchest afforded to Erik ten Hag last summer, a move for Fernandez would be an affordable option to solve a problem area. Given he knows the club, and Amorim will be well aware of his qualities having managed Benfica's city rivals Sporting CP, it would be a move that would suit all parties on paper.\n\n\"On paper he is a good fit, along with doing very well covering the left flank and combining well with his teammates,\" Fumacas added. \"He has also played as a third centre-half at Benfica during some tactical variations by Lage.\n\n\"He likes to associate with the midfield in the build-up process, and does very well in short combinations, and getting into the final third - reminiscent of Alejandro Grimaldo, but with more of a defensive ability to his game.\n\n\"I feel Carreras is doing well at Benfica because of the trust Lage has put in him, and because he has been able to win the hearts of the fans with his performances.\n\n\"Playing at Old Trafford, where he didn't have the best of times, endured rejection, albeit normal for the process of a young player, may be something that will weigh on his psyche, but we are also talking about a 21 year old Carreras who has evolved mentally with the experiences he's had.\""

        "headline": "Antony might have Manchester United lifeline after 'annoyed' comment",
        "article_text": "Antony has been an awful signing for Man Utd but might have one last chance to save his career at Old Trafford.\n\nThe majority of fans believe Manchester United should cut their losses on Antony. The winger's time in Manchester since he signed from Ajax in a deal worth £86million has been disastrous and he looks destined to be remembered as one of the worst signings in the club's history.\n\n“Antony is one of the most exciting young talents in European football and has exactly the right profile for the attacking, dynamic team that Erik ten Hag is building,\" said former football director John Murtough when he was signed. That statement is 25 months old but hasn't aged well.\n\nIt might have been worth double checking Antony's passport to check if he's Brazilian. He doesn't have the flair, creativity or quality that is associated with South America's greatest footballing exports, although the 'Anturny' did cause quite a stir in his first few months at the club. The 'Anturny' skill move wouldn't have been a talking point if he had enjoyed a brilliant first season but he contributed just four goals and two assists in the Premier League.\n\nAlthough Antony scored in his first three league appearances against Arsenal, Manchester City and Everton, which is remarkable with the benefit of hindsight, he didn't score in the top flight again for six months and it didn't take long for many to conclude he wasn't good enough for United.\n\nBut you should always give players the benefit of the doubt and a season to settle. Antony needed to grab the bull by the horns in his second year at Old Trafford and silence the growing doubters but he actually regressed, producing just one goal and one assist in the league.\n\n\"I definitely need more goal participations and to score more goals,\" he told a handful of journalists in a Beverly Hills hotel while on pre-season tour in August. \"It's something I demand from myself. Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\n\n\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also vowed he would score more goals with his right foot and told reporters he would show them \"his notes one day.\" Antony does not lack self belief - he wouldn't be at United without it - but he's failed to back up his words on the pitch, which is how he's judged.\n\nAntony has started one game this season, against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup when he converted a penalty against League One opposition. He has been given just over 150 minutes in all competitions.\n\nTen Hag's decision to overlook Amad for Antony when he made a substitution against Fenerbahce in the Europa League was surprising, but he explained he works hard in training. To Antony's credit, he looked bright when coming on but picked up an injury and had to be stretchered off.\n\nUnfortunately for Antony, not much has gone right for him during his time in Manchester - he has dealt with issues away from the pitch - and he's in the last chance saloon at United.\n\nThe appointment of Ruben Amorim offers a clean slate but Antony must be sold in the summer window if he's unable to improve between now until the end of the season.\n\nWhat could spark that improvement? Perhaps he could play as a wing-back. It was fascinating to read him say playing at full-back initially \"annoyed\" him last season, because adapting and playing in that role in Amorim's system might be the only way to save his United career.\n\nAntony has transferable skills that could make him an effective wing-back but playing him there would be a desperate roll of the dice, with the hope of unlocking some improvement. Whether a position change would work remains to be seen. Antony's time might already be up."

        "article_text": "Jamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nThe 39-year-old gave his first interview as the club’s new head boss last week, just days after arriving at Carrington. He underlined his eagerness to instil a sense of identity back into United and the importance of building momentum from the off.\n\nHe makes his debut at Ipswich Town on Sunday with United languishing in 13th. Amorim is expected to field his 3-4-3 formation that brought him two Portuguese titles at Sporting CP.\n\nWhile former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does “not think this squad is suited to three at the back”, he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way. \"I’ve been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,” he told The Overlap US.\n\n“He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?’\n\n“And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change’.\n\n“But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n“I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.”\n\nCarragher warned that Amorim faces heftier competition from lower-table teams in the Premier League than he did in Portugal. But he reckons that United will be put in good stead if Amorim is able to get his squad to buy in and then successfully implement his philosophy.\n\n“Let’s not forget, the Premier League has the best managers in the world and he’s coming up against some top operators, not even necessarily at the top end of the table,” Carragher added.\n\n“You look at people like Marco Silva or Thomas Frank, managers of teams in the middle of the table. They’re top managers.\n\n“I admired how confident [Amorim] was and this real belief he seems to have and if he can put that into Manchester United, because there’s still quality players there, and also make them believe in this system and how they go about it, I think he can do well."

        "headline": "Viktor Gyokeres to Man United transfer latest amid Ruben Amorim 'agreement' and Sporting dilemma",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is in his first week of taking Manchester United training following his move from Sporting CP over the international break. The manager takes charge of his first game on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick off) when United travel to take on Ipswich Town.\n\nThe arrival of Amorim has caused excitement among the United fan base. It has also started speculation over who he could sign in his first transfer window, with the January window fast approaching.\n\nOne of the names to be heavily linked is Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres. The 26-year-old is making waves across Europe with his goalscoring record.\n\nIn 18 domestic games across all competitions so far this season, he has scored 23 goals, including a hat trick in the Champions League win over Man City. The striker has also impressed on the international stage for Sweden, scoring nine goals in six Nations League appearances.\n\nAmorim’s move from sporting to United has led to speculation that he could be eyeing a reunion with his former striker. With that in mind, here is the latest on a potential move for Gyokeres, either in January or in the summer.\n\n#### ‘Gentleman’s agreement’\n\nAny potential move for Gyokeres in January could be put on hold, due to a reported ‘gentleman’s agreement’ between Amorim and former club Sporting CP. It is said that the manager has agreed not to approach any of Sporting’s players in the upcoming transfer window.\n\n[Journalist Fabrizio Romano claims](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-man-united-transfer-30418333) that as part of the negotiations that saw Amorim leave the club for United, the agreement was reached. That’s due to Sporting’s hopes of winning their respective title this season, although any summer move for players, including Gyokeres has not been ruled out.\n\n#### What the player has said\n\nGyokeres himself responded to rumours over his future earlier this week. He gave his thoughts on Amorim’s move to United, before commenting on the links.\n\n\"It’s very sad that he’s leaving, but of course we understand his decision,\" he said. \"He has of course meant a lot [to me] considering that he gave me that chance and that he made me develop so much.\"\n\nGyokeres then added: \"He [Amorim] probably has some strikers there already, so we’ll see. No, he hasn’t [contacted me]. It's fun but nothing I attach any importance to because it’s talk and nothing concrete.\"\n\n#### Sporting ‘need to sell’\n\nFormer Portuguese international Jose Fonte has provided hope to United over completing a deal, by highlighting the financial disparity between the two clubs. \"Portuguese clubs have got no option but to sell for the right price,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to sell. Portuguese clubs have to sell one or two players every season.\n\n\"We don't have the same TV rights as the Premier League so we don't have the capacity to hold on to players. It would be lovely to see Portugal with a little bit more capacity to hold on to their talent, of course.\"\n\n#### United monitoring the striker\n\nUnited Scouts were reportedly in attendance to watch Gyokeres in Sweden’s 2-1 victory over Sloviakia at the weekend. The striker, of course, was on the scoresheet, finding the back of the net after just three minutes to give his side the lead.\n\nScouts would have also been impressed with his performance in Sweden’s next game. The striker scored four times in his nation’s 6-0 win over Azerbaijan on Tuesday night.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   [Man United already have £25m windfall to help secure Ruben Amorim's dream first signing](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-already-25m-windfall-30415718?int_source=nba)\n*   [Joshua Zirkzee Man United transfer latest: Italy return, January exit, Viktor Gyokeres impact](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/joshua-zirkzee-man-united-transfer-30424296?int_source=nba)"

        "headline": "Gary Neville and Roy Keane disagree on Marcus Rashford decision ahead of Ruben Amorim Man United call",
        "article_text": "Gary Neville has called out Casemiro and Marcus Rashford for deciding to jet-off to the USA during November's international break, but his ex-Manchester United teammate didn't agree.\nRoy Keane did not take the same stance as ex-teammate Gary Neville.\n\nGary Neville says it was \"not right\" for Casemiro and Marcus Rashford to travel to the United States during the international break, given the poor season Manchester United are having, and suggests it might not have been what Ruben Amorim would have wanted.\n\nNeither was called up for their respective countries this month and so decided to travel to Portland to watch an NBA game. Neville has questioned the decision given the toll the long flights and time difference might have had on both players ahead of Amorim's first week at United.\n\nBoth were seen in high spirits during the new head coach's first training session at Carrington on Monday - ahead of Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town - but Neville is unsure that they have prepared themselves in the best way given the current context at United.\n\n\"I'd ask the question, would my manager want to see me there, would the fans at this moment in time?\" Neville mused. Former United skipper Roy Keane did not see much issue in their travels, though.\n\nHe said: \"They would have had the international break sorted a couple of weeks ago. I wouldn't be a big fan of it, but I would have thought there was bigger stuff to worry about.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, if they're training in the week and they're looking a bit sluggish... We saw pictures with the new manager coming in smiling, all happy, good PR!\"\n\nNeville went on: \"The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you're best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season.\n\n\"He [Rashford] has got a mental break - he's got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what's the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n\"This is on Casemiro more than Rashford, but if I'm 30-years-old and I'm looking after my body - and he's won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player - but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, then we would say he could struggle this weekend because he's been away.\n\n\"They have chosen that international break, almost. If you are talking about minor details - in being as professional as you can be and as prepared as you can be for a training session on a Monday night - that isn't the best choice of venue.\"\n\nNeville reckons that he's not overly irked by Casemiro and Rashford's trip, but does not believe either would have had copious amounts of rest time ahead of their return to training. He questioned whether the decision emanated acute \"professionalism\".\n\nNeville continued: \"I'm not that wound up about Rashford and Casemiro going over to the United States, but what I'm asking is; If you've got a four-day break, Portland is a 12-hour flight and an eight-hour time difference...\n\n\"Your jet-lag is bad, and you feel a bit [rough].\n\n\"They went to Portland and I'm asking the question based on professionalism - you're playing badly, the team are losing, you're 13th in the league, and there is a new manager coming in - would you choose that trip as a break to recharge your batteries? That's not a recharging trip. It's not right, that."

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim could sell five Manchester United players to fund January transfer window",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim could sell five Manchester United players to fund January transfer window - Amie Wilson - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nRuben Amorim could sell five Manchester United players to fund January transfer window\n======================================================================================\n\nThe latest Manchester United news and opinion as the new head coach could potentially boost his January transfer budget with sales in his first transfer window with the club.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAntony is one of the players who could potentially be sold by Manchester United in the January transfer window. (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\n\n###### Get the latest MEN breaking news on WhatsApp\n\nRuben Amorim doesn’t have long to get his feet under the table at Manchester United before the chaos of a transfer window is upon us.\n\nThe new head coach started working with his players on the training pitch this week as preparations for the weekend’s clash against Ipswich start. The time in training will give Amorim a chance to assess his squad, with decisions to be made ahead of the transfer window that opens in less than two months.\n\nAny new boss is likely to be keen to bring in his own players when they have the chance. However, according to the Telegraph, worries over Profitability and Sustainability rules (PSRs), as well as the club wanting to implement a more sustainable structure, means that the transfer budget in January is to be ‘modest.’\n\n**READ MORE: I rejected a move to Manchester United - it would not have made me happy**\n\n**READ MORE: Man United star Antony got told 'behaving like an idiot' ruined Liverpool transfer hopes**\n\nHowever, one way of boosting the budget will be to sell players. With that in mind, here is a look at five players who United could cash in on in the winter window.\n\n#### Harry Maguire\n\nThe defender arrived for £80 million in the summer of 2019 but has found himself down the pecking order for the last couple of seasons. Maguire has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford over the last few transfer windows, with United even said to have agreed a £30 million fee with West Ham in the summer of 2023 with a move never materialising.\n\nMaguire will be entering the final six months of his contract when the January transfer window opens, it means, unless he signs a new deal, it will be United’s last chance to get some money back for the defender.\n\nWhile they may not get the £30 million agreed with West Ham 18 months ago, any fee would provide a boost to the transfer window funds.\n\n#### Victor Lindelof\n\nLindelof is in a similar situation to Maguire in that he will be entering the final six months of his contract when the January window opens. The Sweden international is also down the pecking order and has been linked with a move away.\n\nHowever, Amorim will have to make a decision over potentially losing two centre-backs in the same window. While getting money for them will provide a potential financial boost, it will leave Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinex and Jonny Evans as the centre-backs left in the squad.\n\n#### Christian Eriksen\n\nAnother player who will have just six months remaining on his deal in January. He was made available in the most recent transfer window, but decided to stay at Old Trafford for the final year of his contract.\n\nSpeaking about his future while on international duty, the Dane said: \"I haven't focused on it yet, and I haven't heard anything from the club. Right now it's just about football, and then we have to see where we stand in January and for that matter in the summer.\"\n\n#### Marcus Rashford\n\nRashford has struggled for form this season, and is one player who could bring in decent money to fund January incomings. As an academy graduate he would also represent pure profit, which would be a boost in terms of the Premier League’s PSRs.\n\nWith questions also over where he would fit into Amorim’s system, a move could benefit all parties. It would provide a fresh start for Rashford and a financial boost to United.\n\n#### Antony\n\nThe winger has struggled to make an impact since his £82 million move from Ajax in the summer of 2022. It is reported that United have already made the decision to cash in when the January window opens.\n\nWhile they will struggle to get anywhere near the transfer fee that they paid just two-and-a-half years ago, a sale could add to the funds available for Amorim. Finding a buyer willing to complete a permanent deal, as opposed to a loan, could however be a challenge.\n\n### Sign up to get even more from our Man United coverage\n\nWe want your views, Reds.

        "headline": "Man United icon Ruud van Nistelrooy should have replaced Sir Alex Ferguson's saviour",
        "article_text": "Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\nFew figures who have left the Manchester United dugout since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement have been serenaded by the Stretford End in their last game.\nEven ever-popular Ole Gunnar Solskjaer witnessed a toxic end to his tenure at Vicarage Road albeit he has managed to redeem himself with the fanbase. And yet, Ruud van Nistelrooy managed it as his time at Old Trafford came to an end before the international break with a comfortable victory over Leicester City.\nThe next day, the Dutchman left United for good as Ruben Amorim welcomed his own backroom staff to the club. While it was disappointing to see Van Nistelrooy leave, it is clear that he deserved more than an advisory role at United should he have stayed for the Amorim premiership and thus he jumped quickly into the process of finding a new job.\nPerhaps the biggest currently available job in the United Kingdom is in the Midlands where Coventry City controversially parted ways with Mark Robins at the beginning of the month. Robins once scored the goal that arguably saved Ferguson's career at Old Trafford and it would have been fitting to see one ex-United striker be replaced by another.\nHowever, it is not just sentimentality that points us to this solution. Van Nistelrooy came to United in the summer after an impressive managerial stint at PSV Eindhoven and it is clear the Reds' disheartened squad responded to the Dutchman's tactics during his brief interim role.\nBut despite this, it looks almost certain that Coventry will overlook him in favour of Frank Lampard. The former Chelsea man enjoyed a good spell at Derby County as a manager but that is five years ago now.\nSince then, he has returned to Stamford Bridge twice for two poor spells and was mediocre at best with Everton albeit he did help them to survive in the Premier League. From a Sky Blues perspective it is an underwhelming appointment should it be confirmed.\nWith a trio of bad tenures under his belt, Lampard represents a huge risk for the Coventry boardroom particularly if, as their supporters fear, he has been brought in because he is a big name. Van Nistelrooy could have also provided that while also giving fans a coach who is coming in on a high.\nCoventry seems to have committed yet another error in what has been a bad month for the club and their ownership could live to regret overlooking Van Nistelrooy."

There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nPep Guardiola has won a total of 18 trophies with Manchester City.

        "article_text": "**Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.**\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.sportbible.com/kobbie-mainoo) and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed [a handful of details in the training session](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/ruben-amorim-training-session-luke-shaw-kobbie-mainoo-283978-20241119). Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while [Luke Shaw](https://www.sportbible.com/luke-shaw) was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert [**Fabrizio Romano**](https://x.com/fabrizioromano/status/1859508798802575382?s=46&t=uxXCWj4CwoDO3TqegCIzVA) has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on [**X**](https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1859508798802575382), formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth\\\\s Milos Kerkez and [Bayern Munich](https://www.sportbible.com/bayern-munich)'s Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth.

        "article_text": "**Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.**\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.sportbible.com/erik-ten-hag), who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, [United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the [**Telegraph**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/18/ruben-amorim-reduced-budget-man-utd-end-transfer-churn/), who claim [Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication [**AS**](https://as.com/futbol/primera/pedro-porro-en-la-mirilla-n/) has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under [Ruben Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to [**Expresso**](https://tribuna.expresso.pt/entrevistas-tribuna/2024-04-19-entrevista-a-pedro-porro-em-2021-escondi-uma-lesao-para-participar-no-jogo-do-titulo-pelo-sporting.-queria-ir-a-jogo-sim-ou-sim-520395c4) earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like [Ange Postecoglou](https://www.sportbible.com/ange-postecoglou) here at [Tottenham](https://www.sportbible.com/spurs),\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe,\"\n\nPorro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPedro Porro was a regular starter under Amorim at Sporting. Image credit: Getty\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023."

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the [Liverpool Echo](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/trent-alexander-arnold-billboard-truth-30411807) explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously."

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before [Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper [**Expresso**](https://tribuna.expresso.pt/), Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n“I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of [Manchester City](https://www.sportbible.com/man-city) director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told [**talkSPORT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XHDavi8KD0).\"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\nTyson Fury training footage concerns boxing fans\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.\""

Dide has been able to keep things under wraps but has pulled back the curtain ever so slightly, opening up about how he balances being a football and musician at the same time.\n\nIn April he said Kevin De Bruyne is the best player he has played against before claiming his teammates and manager had no idea about his hustle on the side.\n\nPremier League footballer releases rap song\n\nCredit: Dide\n\n0 seconds of 3 minutes, 36 secondsVolume 90%\n\nEddie Nketiah, Wilfried Zaha, Reiss Nelson and Alex Iwobi were just some of the many suggestions fans have come up with but some also 'outed' Sheyi Ojo, who Liverpool bought for a fee of £2 million when he was just 14.\n\nOjo, a member of England's Under 20 World Cup-winning squad in 2017, played 13 times for the Reds and left for Cardiff City in 2022 after a number of loan spells, including Wolves, Fulham, Rangers and Reims.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Slovenian side NK Maribor in September but in a new interview with The Athletic, Ojo was asked if he is actually Dide.\n\nAnd he was happy to dismiss talk of it being him as he would not be one to put \"anything else in the picture to sway my concentration\".\n\nDide's identity is yet to be revealed. Image: Dide\n\n“It’s funny because everywhere I go people ask me about it but honestly I haven’t got a clue who it is,” Ojo said.\n\n“All I can say is I’m super focused on football as I always have been, that’s pretty much the only thing that matters to me. I wouldn’t be putting anything else in the picture to sway my concentration, it’s definitely not something I’m involved in but I understand everyone’s curiosities.”\n\nSheyi Ojo has denied claims he is masked rapper Dide. image: Getty\n\nA year ago Aston Villa and Belgium midfielder Amadou Onana, then at Everton, claimed he knew Dide's real identify but could not possibly disclose it due to a \"code\".\n\nTyson Fury training footage concerns boxing fans\n\n\"There has been some rumours but there is a player code that I can't break,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"People try to get it out of my mouth but I won't.\""

As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, according to Sky Germany.\n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Welt, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That [amount] won't be enough,” Krosche said.\n\n“It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself.\n\nThat's an agreement we make with the players."

        "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Rúben Amorim",
        "article_text": "Rúben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited."

        "article_text": "Kone was substituted last week.\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen."

Amad scored 14 goals in 42 games for the Championship side as Sunderland reached the play-offs.\n\nPellistri was due to leave on loan in the summer but ended up remaining at United after Amad sustained a knee injury in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July.\n\nAmad returned to training in early December and he performed creditably off the bench in the loss at Forest."

He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPedro Porro was a regular starter under Amorim at Sporting. Image credit: Getty\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023."

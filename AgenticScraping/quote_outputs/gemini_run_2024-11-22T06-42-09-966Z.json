      "headline": "Concerns over suitability of a squad built for Erik ten Hag in changing styles.",
      "article_text": "As Manchester United supporters prepare to welcome a highly-rated and talented coach from outside of Europe's 'big five' leagues who has analysts swooning, they may be worried that it all sounds a bit familiar.\n\nBut in Ruben Amorim, they can be certain that in one crucial aspect he won't be anything like Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe defining complaint about the sacked Dutchman was that after two-and-a-bit seasons the football was still formless and the tactical direction indecipherable.\n\nAmorim, who will leave Portuguese champions Sporting to move to Old Trafford next month, is nothing if not a diligent - and decisive - tactical thinker.\n\nFrom a ruthless press to proactive possession football, from a daring high line to a complexly shape-shifting 3-4-3 formation, the hallmarks of Amorim's football will be etched into muscle memory in detailed training sessions.\n\nAnd there will be valid concerns. Most prominent will be how a Manchester United squad built in Ten Hag's image will cope with the change to a back three and a tactical system entirely at odds with what came before. It won't suit everyone.\n\nWith United posting a £113m net loss for 2023-24, a £15m compensation bill for sacking Ten Hag and paying at least £9m to get Amorim out of Sporting, added to the £200m spent on summer transfers, the Portuguese is not likely to have much budget for January signings.\n\nAmorim is, first and foremost, a flexible tactician.\n\nHe will sit deep when required and push high when he can; will play neat possession football in some fixtures and tell his players to hit longer diagonals out to the wide men in others.\n\nCase in point: Sporting topped the charts in Portugal for both build-up attacks (126) and direct attacks (74) last season.\n\nBut one thing that doesn't change is the 3-4-3 formation, which is rumoured to be a factor in why Liverpool favoured Arne Slot over Amorim when Jurgen Klopp left this summer.\n\nThat means Manchester United will revert to a back three for the first time in a decade - since the early days of Louis van Gaal in 2014.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt, the marquee summer signing, is the most likely to struggle. He didn't look comfortable when Bayern Munich experimented with a back three under Julian Nagelsmann in 2022-23 and was dropped from van Gaal's Netherlands back three just one game into the 2022 World Cup.\n\nHarry Maguire is the only United player used to a back three, and inexperience here is a particular concern given that Amorim's aggressive high line leaves space out wide and in behind.\n\nThe Premier League is increasingly defined by the sort of fast transitions that could expose this vulnerability. \n\nThen again, any downside from the switch may be countered by the basic defensive advantage of moving from a four to a five.\n\nAfter all, last season United conceded the second most shots of any team in Europe's 'big five' leagues (667), whereas Sporting, in a compact off-the-ball 5-4-1, conceded the fewest shots in the Primeira Liga (269).\n\nThe wing-backs play a crucial attacking role in Amorim teams, stretching the play to allow the wingers to drift infield and get tight to the striker.\n\nUnited do not have any natural wing-backs in the squad but if Amorim is to convert a couple he will prioritise the players more comfortable attacking than defending.\n\nThat's an accurate description of Diogo Dalot, who created 38 chances in the Premier League last season - the third most of any United player - and could be pushed forward.\n\nThe man signed to close Ten Hag's infamous donut - the midfield hole that opens up when United's forwards press and defenders backtrack – has previously enjoyed success under Amorim.\n\nUgarte made his name at Sporting, where in 2022-23 he topped the Portuguese charts for tackles and interceptions (179) as the chief destroyer in Amorim's double pivot.\n\nAmorim's wingers, who sit just behind the striker to form a box-shape with the two central midfielders, tend to be direct runners capable of pressing hard and weaving their way through the lines in the transition.\n\nIn other words, Amorim prefers the polar opposite of the mercurial Fernandes, a traditional number 10 whose free roaming might not work in such a fine-tuned system.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho, on the other hand, could be the perfect fit. He loves to dribble through a crowd, completing 41 progressive carries this campaign, not far off double that of any other United player.\n\nHowever, Rashford would need to recapture those 2022-23 levels, with his progressive ball carry figures only at 16 this season.\n\nViktor Gyokeres has been a revelation for Amorim, scoring 41 goals in 42 league games with a mixture of targeted runs, pressing intensity, and power in the penalty area; three attributes Ten Hag used to describe Rasmus Hojlund when he arrived at Old Trafford in August 2023.\n\nAmorim is more than willing to alter his tactical set-up to suit the strengths and limitations of his players, suggesting that even those players who don't look like an obvious fit could find a manager willing to bend for now... well apart from three at the back.\n",

      "article_text": "Sporting star Ousmane Diomande has spoken with Ruben Amorim about joining Manchester United and is growing increasingly keen on a move to Old Trafford.\n\nHaving joined Sporting from Danish outfit Midtjylland in January 2023, Diomande has quickly earned a reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Portuguese football.\n\nDiomande made 26 appearances across an eye-catching debut season in the Primeira Liga, playing a key role as Sporting – led by United’s new head coach Amorim – stormed to an historic 20th league title last term.\n\nAnd while Diomande’s Sporting career is still in its infancy, speculation is mounting that the centre-back could be set for a big-money switch away from the Jose Alvalade Stadium before too long.\n\nAccording to Sky, Diomande is ‘sure to be one of the attractions of the next two transfer windows, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal all battling it out for the Ivory Coast international.\n\nDiomande has been firmly on City’s radar since his Midtjylland days and the Premier League champions are targeting the Sporting sensation as a ‘priority’.\n\nCity’s incoming director of football Hugo Viana – who will succeed Txiki Begiristain at the end of the season – has already prepared a plan of action to convince Sporting’s president, Frederico Varandas, to part with Diomande.\n\nHowever, the report states that United are determined not to fall behind their bitter rivals in the transfer race and Amorim has already spoken with Diomande over the prospect of following him to the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nIt’s claimed Diomande ‘knows it would be beneficial for his development’ to continue with Amorim and he is therefore ‘leaning towards’ United, though City are refusing to give up hope in their pursuit of the centre-half.\n\nDiomande currently has an €80million (£66m) release clause in his deal with Sporting, though the Primeira Liga outfit recognise it may be unrealistic to expect an offer close to that figure.\n\nThe towering Ivorian, who stands at 6 ft 3 in, is tied into a contract with Sporting until 2027.",

      "headline": "Agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure a major move for winger Geovany Quenda.",
      "article_text": "Geovany Quenda is being pursued by a host of Europe’s biggest clubs including Manchester United and TEAMtalk can confirm his agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure him a major move.\n\nSporting Lisbon have a history of producing some of the world’s best talent and household names. They have another generation of talented young players coming through and Quenda is among them.\n\nQuenda’s name is one that many will have seen in the news as there have been multiple reports about clubs seeking to sign him.\n\nSources have confirmed to TEAMtalk that there is major interest in the teenager winger and he is being scouted by some of the best sides in the world.\n\nThe 17-year-old sensation has made 11 league appearances this season and fans have taken to him immediately. His talent is so great that super agent Mendes snapped him up and now represents him.\n\nMendes has been responsible for some of the biggest deals in the history of the game and was previously the representative of Man Utd icon Cristiano Ronaldo. He is now working to find the next move for Quenda and there is no shortage of options on the table.\n\nA move to the Premier League is a realistic option as scouts from most of the top six sides have been in attendance at Sporting games on multiple occasions this season. Indeed, TEAMtalk revealed on November 4 that Man Utd hold concrete interest in Quenda, who usually operates on the right flank.\n\nLiverpool are keeping tabs on the youngster’s development too, while Juventus are one of several European giants in the picture.\n\nSporting were keen to keep themselves in a strong position with the Portuguese winger and tied him down to a new contract in the summer. The deal he signed in July runs until the summer of 2027 and contains a release clause worth £84million (€100.9m / $106.3m).\n\nThat was a £50m rise from the exit clause in his previous deal and is one of the highest clauses amongst the Sporting squad.\n\nThis clause would be a problem for the likes of United, with the Old Trafford hierarchy keen to keep spending down while simultaneously getting the club back towards the top of the Prem.\n\nThere are some sources who state that the forward could go for less than his clause in the summer, however others are less convinced Sporting will allow him to go for anything short of the full amount.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford will be ‘fighting for their futures’ at United under new boss Ruben Amorim, it has been claimed.\n\nGiveMeSport state Shaw and Rashford must prove their worth to Amorim or risk being replaced.\n\nShaw needs to try and stay fit for a prolonged period after sustaining a number of injuries, while Rashford must get back to his goalscoring best as Amorim will not be as lenient as Erik ten Hag.\n\nSeparate reports claim United are ready to try again for Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.\n\nThe Red Devils agreed personal terms with Branthwaite over the summer but had two bids rejected by Everton.\n\nSporting director Dan Ashworth is now leading the chase and United are prepared to re-open talks.\n\nPROFILE: Who is Geovany Quenda?  \nBorn in Guinea-Bissau in April 2007, Quenda moved to Portugal as a child and joined Amadora-based club Damaiense at the age of eight.\n\nHe also spent two years in Benfica’s academy before joining their arch-rivals Sporting CP in 2021.\n\nIn February 2024, he started a Liga 3 game against Amora and became the youngest-ever player to play for Sporting’s reserve team at the age of 16.\n\nThe left-footed right-winger showcased his pace and his dribbling ability and caught the attention of first-team manager Ruben Amorim.\n\n“He can play in several positions, he has a lot of quality and irreverence. He is another option,” Amorim said after naming him on the bench for a Europa League tie against Atalanta in March 2024.\n\nQuenda has also shone on the international stage as his performances for Portugal at the 2024 UEFA European Under-17 Championship earned him a place in the Team of the Tournament.\n\nHe marked his senior debut for Sporting with a goal against Porto in August 2024 and became the youngest goalscorer in the club’s history at the age of 17 years and 95 days, overtaking the likes of Ronaldo and Simao.\n\nThe teenager then became the youngest Portuguese player to start a Champions League match during Sporting’s 2-0 win over Lille in September 2024.\n\nHe has also been called up to the senior Portugal squad and was an unused substitute in their 2-1 win over Scotland in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n“The national team coaches always say that age is not a factor. (Quenda) showed incredible personality, quality and adaptability,” Roberto Martinez said.\n\n“He’s a player who likes to make things difficult (for defenders). He has technical quality (that is) not normal for a 17-year-old. He’s now in Sporting’s first team and has shown incredible personality.”\n\nThe forward – who can also play as a wing-back – has since made two appearances for Portugal’s Under-21s and registered an assist in a 2-1 win over Andorra.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim to operate on more modest budget to end costly cycle.",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad as the club aims to end the damaging and costly cycle of mass overhauls.\n\nThe new United hierarchy have no plans under Amorim to rip up a squad they feel is capable of delivering far more and are determined to move away from a culture of persistent upheaval they believe to be financially unsustainable and destructive to coherent squad building.\n\nDenmark striker Rasmus Hojlund and England midfielder Mason Mount are cited as just two examples of players United are hoping can thrive in a new environment under the charismatic Portuguese, who will take charge of his first game as the club’s new head coach away to Ipswich Town on Sunday. Amorim took official charge of his first training session with United on Monday.\n\nUnited have averaged five new signings every summer for the past 10 years under four different managers with vastly different ideas of how they want to play. All have had little success to show for the huge expenditure.\n\nWhile Amorim is expected to be operating under a more modest transfer budget next summer than his predecessor Ten Hag did during his 2½-year reign, when he spent more than £600 million, United want to implement a more sustainable structure where waste is limited, the churn of players greatly reduced and more talent realised.\n\nUnited hope Amorim can inject new lease of life.\n\nUnited feel there are plenty of players in the squad who, with better coaching, attention and support in the right system and set-up, have a much higher ceiling than they may have shown previously. The club hope Amorim can unlock that potential.\n\nEqually, there is a feeling there may be more experienced players who also stand to benefit considerably from Amorim’s arrival and others who find they are given a new lease of life in potentially reimagined roles.\n\nWith losses before tax totalling £312.9 million over the past three seasons, United are under huge pressure to reduce costs to ensure continued compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and Uefa’s own financial sustainability regulations.\n\nThose pressures will become more acute if the club miss out on Champions League qualification for a second successive season and, with it, the vast broadcast revenues that come with playing in Europe’s premier club competition. In that scenario, United would also face a financial penalty under the terms of their kit deal with Adidas.\n\nUnited, who shed 250 staff jobs in the summer, are continuing to review costs across all areas of the club as they strive to reduce those losses. That includes the possibility of cutting in half the cash they give to the Manchester United Disabled Supporters’ Association, although there is no certainty at this stage that will happen.\n\nThe wider financial challenges will ensure a pressing need for United to sell well to raise money to reinvest next year and a sensible approach to buying after years of transfer-market failures and scattergun spending that have left little room for manoeuvre. Old Trafford sources insist it is imperative the club move away from the wasteful, inefficient transfer approach of the past and the cumulative damage of repeat mistakes by building a more sustainable model and structure.\n\nUnited are unlikely to be particularly active in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, players leave or injuries or other factors create a problem that has to be addressed.\n\nAmorim given time to assess his squad.\n\nDan Ashworth, the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, the technical director and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will give Amorim time to assess the squad and see how players adapt to his approach and methods before they start to make any definitive plans for next summer’s window and the type of players and areas they might want to target to supplement what is already there – in addition to who may go.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all out of contract next summer, as are Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo, although the club have options to extend both of those players’s deals by another 12 months.\n\nCasemiro and Tyrell Malacia enter the final 12 months of their contracts at the end of the season but with options for another year. Chelsea have an obligation to buy England winger Jadon Sancho, who is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge, next summer so long as the west-London club finish in the top 14 of the Premier League this season.\n\nAmorim takes over a United side who are 13th in the Premier League, albeit just four points off the top four, after the club’s poor start to the season under Ten Hag.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the Dutchman’s interim replacement, helped to stabilise results during a four-game spell in charge, including a 1-1 draw against Chelsea and 3-0 win over Leicester City in the league.\n\nAmorim spoke about playing “without fear” from day one and “winning time” and patience through victories and establishing a clear identity and idea that the fans can recognise and get behind.\n\nThe 39-year-old is expected to implement a change of system by adopting a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-3 formation, systems that brought him considerable success at Sporting.\n\nSeveral players whom Ten Hag was unable to call on this season are moving closer to first-team returns, including summer signing Leny Yoro and left-backs Luke Shaw and Malacia, while Amorim will soon hope to have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Maguire back after muscle injuries. There are fitness concerns, though, over Lisandro Martinez, who had to withdraw from the Argentina squad last week.",

      "article_text": "Leny Yoro is fully fit and gearing up for his Man United debut under new head coach Ruben Amorim this month.\n\nYoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night. Yoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left. Yoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6, and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday. Martinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City. \n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now. Shaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era.\n\nAmorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n### Rashford up top\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nRasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible.\n\nIn his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   Ruben Amorim has already found the answer to his first Manchester United selection dilemma\n*   Ruben Amorim takes decision with Leny Yoro at Manchester United",

      "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The _Manchester Evening News_ revealed two weeks ago that United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United since February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo, and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United can make stunning January transfer statement by hijacking Real Madrid plan. Ruben Amorim is on the hunt for a left wing-back for his Man Utd system and the ideal player could be available for nothing next summer.\n\nRecruitment is done a little differently at Manchester United these days, but it does feel like the new structure put in place by Ineos has yet to truly make its mark on the club.\n\nThe initial £52m deal to sign teenager Leny Yoro from Lille was the stand-out transfer of the summer and a statement of intent from United, beating Real Madrid and Liverpool to the signing of one of the most highly-rated teenagers in European football. But the wheels had been greased for that move before United's new football department was fully installed.\n\nAfter that, the signings had a relatively familiar feel, with two former Ajax players and a Dutch forward. The decision to push for Manuel Ugarte, a holding midfielder who wasn't top of Erik ten Hag's wish list, was at least a sign of flexibility and things operating a little differently.\n\nTen Hag's sacking, and replacing him with Ruben Amorim as the first United boss to be referred to as head coach rather than manager, completes the organisational flow chat at Carrington. Sporting director Dan Ashworth now heads up the football department, with Amorim reporting to him. Technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell are also involved in transfers.\n\nThere will be a limit to what they can do, certainly in January and perhaps even heading into the 2025 summer window. An outlay of £600m in three summers under Ten Hag has depleted resources, and there is an expectation that Amorim will start to get the most out of the talent already in place.\n\nUnited have made a financial loss for five years in a row and continue to feel the pressure of financial fair play rules instigated by UEFA and the Premier League, so we can expect a tightening of the belt under Sir Jim Ratcliffe for a little while. The purse strings could be loosened if Amorim can deliver Champions League football for next season.\n\nThat makes hunting for bargains and deals vital. If Amorim's priority remains a left wing-back, then there is an option that could be snapped up as soon as New Year's Day.\n\nFor now, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are the only options available in that area of the pitch. In training this week, Shaw has operated as a left-sided centre-back and Malacia as a wing-back, but both are returning from substantial injury layoffs. Amorim could be inventive and turn to Amad and Antony, but the feeling persists that he might look for a solution from outside in the long term.\n\nThat could be Alphonso Davies, with United credited with an interest in the 24-year-old as his contract at Bayern Munich ticks down. Davies' deal expires in the summer, and he has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.\n\nDavies' agent recently insisted reports of a deal between his client and Real Madrid were \"not true\" and said he had options, including staying at Bayern. United can officially approach the Canadian international from January 1.\n\nThe fast, athletic, and attacking Davies certainly looks a good fit for Amorim's system, and it would make sense for United to at least consider an approach. If they can beat Real at their own game and secure him on a free transfer, then it really would be a statement of intent from the club's new football structure.",

      "headline": "Manchester United make Sekou Kone plan after midfielder's injury scare",
      "article_text": "Man United signed Malian Sekou Kone in the summer and the midfielder has an exciting future at Old Trafford.\n\nKone was substituted last week.\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow. Another United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

There are just six weeks until the January transfer window reopens in the new year, which will give Amorim plenty of time to figure out whether he reinforcements will be needed.\n\nAfter spending more than £200million on transfers last summer, United could have a more restricted budget to operate with this time around. The club have also dished out around £35m in compensation.\n\nAround £10m was paid to Newcastle United for sporting director Dan Ashworth while around £17m will be handed out to Erik ten Hag in sacking pay-out.\n\nAhead of what could be a busy new year for the Reds nonetheless, the Manchester Evening News will keep you up to date with all the latest news and transfer gossip around United. A reunion between Amorim and his former player Viktor Gyokeres continues to do the rounds but whether that will happen, remains to be seen.\n\nMarcus Rashford must step up under Ruben Amorim or 'he’ll have a problem'. Former Man United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen believes Marcus Rashford's career is on the line under Ruben Amorim.\n\nSpeaking to TribalFootball.com, he said: \"Ruben Amorim’s arrival is a pivotal moment in the Manchester United career of Marcus Rashford. The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\nIt's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\n\nManchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023. Manchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nRuben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nInterest is growing in the Benfica star Orkun Kokcu who could reportedly be allowed to leave in the new year, according to reports. Caught Offside meanwhile, suggest that the Portuguese giants are looking for a fee of around €60-70million.\n\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nAnalysis has shown concerns for United's left-back position with Fabrizio Romano revealing that Man United 'will continue' monitoring Alphonso Davies as the left-back position is reportedly a department the club has made a priority.\n\nRuben Amorim has been made aware of the situation within the club and is expected to utilize his connections and experiences from previous management roles to adjust Manchester United for the better in a hurry as quick as possible. \n\nFinally, reports in Spain claim that United have 'launched an improved bid' to bring Barcelona centre-back Jules Kounde in January. The France international has been with the Spanish giants since 2022 and has 105 appearances to date. It's said Ruben Amorim sees him as a player who would be suited to play in the right wing-back slot.",

      "headline": "'He doesn't give a s**t' - why Ruben Amorim sources believe he will succeed at Manchester United",
      "article_text": "Optimism has returned to Manchester United before a ball has been kicked under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nWhat does someone who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting make of him? “His drive to succeed is incredible,” they said. “He’s ruthless. He doesn’t give a s**t what people say or who players are.”\n\nThat will be music to Manchester United supporters’ ears. The illuminating footage of Amorim in the thick of it during his first team training session at Carrington has further fuelled excitement.\n\nTraining sessions are sensitive and United highlighted that behind the erection of a wall earlier this season that shielded the first team’s pitch. On Monday evening, seven minutes of Amorim timing attacks from back to front was aired. It confirmed Amorim is indoctrinating the players in the ways of his much-hyped 3-4-3, with potential early indicators as to who will start at Ipswich Town on Sunday. There was also the rare sight of United players sprinting towards their own goal.\n\nLeny Yoro was informed on Monday he was down to start for the Under 21s in the National League Cup at Altrincham on Tuesday evening. His absence was owed to Amorim. Yoro was in the United defensive triumvirate for Amorim’s maiden session.\n\nOf all the post-Ferguson managerial appointments, only Jose Mourinho’s in 2016 rivals the buzz around his compatriot. At the time of Erik ten Hag’s overdue dismissal, it seemed unlikely United would settle on a replacement to completely unify the fanbase yet they have achieved that with Amorim.\n\nIt helped that the 39-year-old was visible in the days before United confirmed his imminent arrival, affably indulging the handful of English media representatives at his press conferences in Lisbon. More flocked to his briefings the following week as Sporting gave Manchester City a shellacking in the Champions League. United’s best result in Europe that week was not against PAOK.\n\nThe personable Amorim pressed the flesh during his tour of Old Trafford last Thursday and a handful of fortunate visitors’ own tour coincided with his. Optimism at United has not been this rife or widespread since the FA Cup final, an anomalous high among innumerable lows.\n\nIt makes it all the more peculiar that Amorim will not be introduced at Old Trafford today. He sat at the same press conference seat last week that Ten Hag did a day after the sulphurous 2021-22 campaign ended. Since David Moyes, every permanent or interim United manager has been afforded an introductory press conference at Old Trafford. In the Zoom era, Ralf Rangnick was deemed worthy of a first in-person press conference in 21 months. The Number 7 suite was opened for Mourinho, Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nA paint-by-numbers interview by in-house media with Amorim, conducted last Thursday evening, was published around 24 hours later at 7pm on Friday, a graveyard slot in the daily news cycle. United gave the impression they were burying bad news when Amorim’s arrival is only behind the FA Cup victories over Liverpool and City for their feel-good story of the calendar year.\n\nClub sources say Amorim was deliberately held back to allow him to settle into his new routine, rather than subject him to two press conferences before his first match in charge. He will hold court at Carrington at 1.30pm on Friday.\n\nSome at United are reluctant to be overly positive. They have seen this all before with a new manager, as those who cover them have, too. Figures at the club have welcomed Amorim's energy and his presence has been uplifting. \"He has struck all the right notes,\" one source said.\n\n\"He's more charismatic and empathetic with players and the press than Ten Hag,\" someone else who knows Amorim said. \"He will answer everything at a press conference. He tends to joke.\"\n\nAmorim worked closely with the Sporting president Frederico Varandas and sporting director Hugo Vian. His confidants believe a similar rapport is required with the United hierarchy. Amorim has spoken about his \"connection\" with chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nPortuguese sources feel Amorim will make tweaks to his anticipated 3-4-3 system. The majority of United's centre backs are well versed in the back three set-up while Diogo Dalot operated in a 3-4-3 for Porto B when United scouted him.\n\nAmorim came \"very close\" to succeeding Jurgen Klopp when Liverpool whittled down their shortlist of candidates to Amorim and Arne Slot. Manchester City earmarked Amorim as Pep Guardiola's heir had he left Manchester after ten years. He will encounter Guardiola again in next month's derby.\n\nLike Mourinho, Amorim is holed up in The Lowry Hotel, though his residency is unlikely to rival his mentor's as he is already house-hunting. United security staff have ferried Amorim to Carrington every day this week.\n\nThere is a curious sub-plot to Amorim's United debut at Portman Road. In the opposite dugout, there will be another highly-regarded 30-something coach who was a candidate to replace Ten Hag this year. Kieran McKenna is also another Mourinho protégé, having been promoted to first team coach at United in July 2018 three months after Amorim’s internship at Carrington.\n\nHad United come calling for McKenna a second time last month then his release clause would have been more expensive than Amorim’s prudent €10million buyout. Some of the more entitled United players found McKenna’s methods to be too officious whereas the younger squad members were more receptive.\n\nOne narrative can be scrapped from this weekend’s fixture. The last time United were at Portman Road in May 2002 the game was settled by Ruud van Nistelrooy. Van Nistelrooy gained “closure” with his appreciation for the United supporters at full-time against Leicester two weeks ago. Then Amorim closed the door. There was that ruthlessness, hours after Amorim's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport.\n\nThere was something else Amorim’s former colleague at Sporting mentioned: “He will 100% succeed.”",

Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\nThe best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\nHad some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\nSeldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans**\nTen appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire**\nMissed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof**\nBelatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\nWeary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro**\nThe first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte**\nLeicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen**\nAlready started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes**\nFootball’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad**\nA decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\nUnited’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford**\nWhen he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\nNetted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._\n\n**Rasmus Hojlund**\nTwo goals in 11 appearances marks a startling start to his second season at the club. Unlike last term, Hojlund is struggling to get chances and his lack of presence is a problem. 4",

      "article_text": "Manchester United transfer news as Dan Ashworth starts work on the January transfer window to bolster Ruben Amorim's squad.\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nUnited have invested in centre-forwards in the last two years with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee arriving. However, the latter has struggled to make an impact in England since his £36.5million move from Bologna.\n\nRuben Amorim's appointment as Erik ten Hag's successor has led to speculation linking United with a new centre-forward. Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres is a popular name among the list of candidates but it appears alternatives are now being considered.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer. During the recent international break, Kolo Muani remained adamant at breaking into Luis Enrique's XI.\n\n\"You have to keep your mental strength up, it's up to me to continue working so that the coach trusts me,\" he told Telefoot. \"It's part of my history. I've always worked, I've never had things easy.\n\n\"I have to work harder, make an impression when he calls on me. It's up to me to give my all so that he trusts me.\"",

      "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to the Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not a typical goal scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create the space for them.”",

      "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.”",

      "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper. I've heard they're going to be found not guilty of all of them [the charges].\n\n\"It's just a whisper, it's unconfirmed. It's some bloke down the pub telling me, that sort of level.\n\n\"Listen, it's just a whisper. I was the first person to say Declan Rice is going to Arsenal. There's footage of me saying that from around a year before it happened, from a reliable source.\"\n\nCo-host Darren Bent did joke that the 'reliable source' was perhaps more reliable than Goldstein's City 'whisper'.\n\nSPORTbible has contacted the Premier League for comment.",

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer.

Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure. \"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

      "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. 'Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!' he wrote on Instagram. 'Thank you, Orlando.'\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n'“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,' Neville said.\n\n'He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n'This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n'They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.'\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: 'For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n'We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n'If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,' he said. 'Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.'\n\nHe added: 'Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.'\n\n'If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.'",

He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPedro Porro was a regular starter under Amorim at Sporting.\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years.

      "article_text": "Real Madrid are ‘concerned’ that their pursuit of a Champions League winner could be hijacked by Manchester United.\n\nUnited are currently 13th in the Premier League but will be hoping their fortunes improve under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nHe will take charge of his game as head coach of the Red Devils when his side faces Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November.\n\nAs for Madrid, they have started the season in poor form by their high standards, with Los Blancos currently trailing league leaders Barcelona by six points, having sustained an embarrassing 4-0 loss against the Catalans on October 26.\n\nThe 15-time European Champions also sit 18th in the 36-team Champions League group phase, having suffered shock defeats against Lille and AC Milan.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s options have been ravaged by injuries in recent months, with key players Dani Carvajal and Eder Miltao both sustaining anterior cruciate ligament injuries, which will keep them out for the foreseeable future. David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option. Any reports suggesting otherwise are incorrect.”",

      "article_text": "Manchester United’s players already have a ‘nickname’ for head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim, 39, arrived at the club’s Carrington Training Centre on Monday and was greeted by several members of the Red Devils’ hierarchy – including sporting director Dan Ashworth, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nOn the same day, he took charge of training for the first time, with the Portuguese having just ten senior players available due to the ongoing international break.\n\nAs a result, several academy players joined in the session.\n\nAmad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town.\n\nFans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up.\n\nThe Sun Sport reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence.\n\n“Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained.\n\n“Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence.\n\n“There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own.\n\n“The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\n“When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained.\n\n“Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added.\n\n“I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along.\n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days.\n\n“He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\nRoy Keane leaves The Overlap panel in stitches with comment to Jill Scott\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n“I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT.\"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\nGareth Southgate on England injury crisis\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

Precise in his first touches. He came off after 45 minutes of the first half.\"\n\nLiverpool fans will be happy to see that their man up front only played half of the match on Tuesday as it remains likely that he will start for their trip to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday.\n\nAfter traveling to Southampton, Liverpool will face a tough set of fixtures including back to back home matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nDarwin Nunez started both of Uruguay's matches over the international break.\n\nWith Diogo Jota still recovering from an injury sustained during the match with Chelsea, it is likely that Nunez will start, or at least feature, in all three of Liverpool's next matches. Speaking before the international break, Arne Slot confirmed when Jota is expected to return, saying: “We expect him back after the break. The first weeks after the break, I always say there is privacy about the injury. He will be back one or two weeks after the break.”",

The answer is he should be,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\"\n\nEnnis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. He could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has sent a message to the club's top target Viktor Gyokeres after his stunning performance last night.\n\nThe Nations League came to an end on Tuesday night, with the final matches of the 2024 season taking place.\n\nGyokeres was the standout player of the evening after scoring an incredible four goals during Sweden's dominant 6-0 win over Azerbaijan to secure promotion into League B.\n\nAnd in the aftermath of the amazing performance, United star Fernandes has sent a clear message to the striker amid links of a move to the Premier League side.\n\nAfter scoring during the opener in Sweden's 2-1 win over Slovakia in the Nations League on Saturday, Gyokeres posted a series of images of the match on his Instagram account, writing: \"Thanks for yesterday.\"\n\nAnd some eagle-eyed fans noticed that Fernandes had liked the post, showing that he is clearly keeping tabs on the talented forward ahead of his potential move to Old Trafford.\n\nLinks between Gyokeres and United started after it was confirmed that former Sporting manager Ruben Amorim would be replacing Erik ten Hag as United manager.\n\nDuring his time at the Portuguese side, Amorim signed the 26-year-old forward from Coventry City in a £20million deal.\n\nSince then, the Swede has managed 66 goals and 19 assists in just 68 appearances for Sporting, while bagging 15 goals for his national team.\n\nBut, if a move to United is to happen, it won't be during the upcoming January transfer window after Amorim reportedly promised not to raid his former club this winter.\n\nHowever, according to Manchester Evening News, there is a gentleman's agreement between Sporting and United that would allow Gyokeres to leave in the summer for around £63m if he stays in Lisbon until the end of the season.\n\nTherefore, it comes as no surprise that the United captain would be keeping an eye on his potential future teammates' career abroad. And with Fernandes a self-proclaimed Sporting fan having played there before coming to Old Trafford, he will certainly be aware of his former side's star striker and his performances for both club and country.",

She is rumoured to be earning a joint-record £1.5 million for heading into the jungle and has already been discussing her relationship with one of the Premier League's best ever players.\n\nAnd the row with Vardy has been reignited, with plenty of jibes being made by hosts Ant and Dec and Coleen briefly talking about the 'Wagatha Christie' 2022 trial.\n\nRebekah, a former I'm a Celeb contestant back in 2017, couldn't help but respond on Instagram, writing: \"That feeling when you are living rent free in people's heads [laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe 42-year-old is serving as a columnist for The Sun on jungle affairs and in a video doing the rounds, described Coleen as \"the gift that keeps on giving\" after her boat sank twice in episode one.\n\nFans have wondered what Leicester City striker Vardy thinks about his other half's antics but according to Rebekah, he doesn't mind it at all and is supportive of her actions.\n\nThe mum of five also claimed any abuse subjected to him on the pitch spurs him on.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Jamie is mad at me for speaking out, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,\" she said, as per The Mirror.\n\n\"He’s encouraging me, saying, ‘Give it to her, get the truth out there’.

      "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. \n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

      "article_text": "Liverpool are close to ‘agreeing’ a transfer for a La Liga star as Arne Slot looks to bolster his squad in the January window.\n\nSlot has led his side to 15 wins out of 17 games since joining the club from Feyenoord following Jurgen Klopp’s departure.\n\nHe will no doubt be happy with his start as Liverpool’s manager - his team sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of Slot’s first challenges as manager was the lack of new faces in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool signed just two first-team players – Federico Chiesa and goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nThe club tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad centre-midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with the player favouring a stay in La Liga over a move to Merseyside.\n\nBut it is another player from the Spanish topflight who could be on their way to Anfield come January.\n\nAccording to reports by Football 365, Liverpool are ‘close’ to making Loic Bade their first signing during the window in the new year.\n\nBade, 24, currently plays as a centre-back for struggling Sevilla and has made nine La Liga appearances for the Andalusian outfit so far this term.\n\nThe France Under-21 international had a short loan spell in the Premier League with Nottingham Forest between 2022 and 2023 but failed to make a single competitive first-team appearance at the East Midlands club.\n\nBut since moving on, he has shown promise at Sevilla despite the club sitting in 13th place in Spain’s premier division.\n\nSomething that will no doubt bring a smile to Liverpool fans’ faces is the fact that Bade scored in Sevilla’s 3-0 Europa League quarter-final win over the Premier League club’s arch-rivals Man United in April 2023.\n\nThe defender, who stands at six feet three inches, cuts a calm, composed figure at the heart of defence but would likely play as back-up to Liverpool’s first-choice central defenders Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate if he were to sign a deal at the club.\n\nThe 24-year-old’s Sevilla contract is set to run until June 2029, but it is reported that Sevilla would ‘accept’ a fee of around €30m (£25m) according to Spanish outlet todofichajes.",

        "headline": "Concerns over suitability of a squad built for Erik ten Hag in changing styles.",
        "article_text": "As Manchester United supporters prepare to welcome a highly-rated and talented coach from outside of Europe's 'big five' leagues who has analysts swooning, they may be worried that it all sounds a bit familiar.\n\nBut in Ruben Amorim, they can be certain that in one crucial aspect he won't be anything like Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe defining complaint about the sacked Dutchman was that after two-and-a-bit seasons the football was still formless and the tactical direction indecipherable.\n\nAmorim, who will leave Portuguese champions Sporting to move to Old Trafford next month, is nothing if not a diligent - and decisive - tactical thinker.\n\nFrom a ruthless press to proactive possession football, from a daring high line to a complexly shape-shifting 3-4-3 formation, the hallmarks of Amorim's football will be etched into muscle memory in detailed training sessions.\n\nAnd there will be valid concerns. Most prominent will be how a Manchester United squad built in Ten Hag's image will cope with the change to a back three and a tactical system entirely at odds with what came before. It won't suit everyone.\n\nWith United posting a £113m net loss for 2023-24, a £15m compensation bill for sacking Ten Hag and paying at least £9m to get Amorim out of Sporting, added to the £200m spent on summer transfers, the Portuguese is not likely to have much budget for January signings.\n\nAmorim is, first and foremost, a flexible tactician.\n\nHe will sit deep when required and push high when he can; will play neat possession football in some fixtures and tell his players to hit longer diagonals out to the wide men in others.\n\nCase in point: Sporting topped the charts in Portugal for both build-up attacks (126) and direct attacks (74) last season.\n\nBut one thing that doesn't change is the 3-4-3 formation, which is rumoured to be a factor in why Liverpool favoured Arne Slot over Amorim when Jurgen Klopp left this summer.\n\nThat means Manchester United will revert to a back three for the first time in a decade - since the early days of Louis van Gaal in 2014.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt, the marquee summer signing, is the most likely to struggle. He didn't look comfortable when Bayern Munich experimented with a back three under Julian Nagelsmann in 2022-23 and was dropped from van Gaal's Netherlands back three just one game into the 2022 World Cup.\n\nHarry Maguire is the only United player used to a back three, and inexperience here is a particular concern given that Amorim's aggressive high line leaves space out wide and in behind.\n\nThe Premier League is increasingly defined by the sort of fast transitions that could expose this vulnerability. \n\nThen again, any downside from the switch may be countered by the basic defensive advantage of moving from a four to a five.\n\nAfter all, last season United conceded the second most shots of any team in Europe's 'big five' leagues (667), whereas Sporting, in a compact off-the-ball 5-4-1, conceded the fewest shots in the Primeira Liga (269).\n\nThe wing-backs play a crucial attacking role in Amorim teams, stretching the play to allow the wingers to drift infield and get tight to the striker.\n\nUnited do not have any natural wing-backs in the squad but if Amorim is to convert a couple he will prioritise the players more comfortable attacking than defending.\n\nThat's an accurate description of Diogo Dalot, who created 38 chances in the Premier League last season - the third most of any United player - and could be pushed forward.\n\nThe man signed to close Ten Hag's infamous donut - the midfield hole that opens up when United's forwards press and defenders backtrack – has previously enjoyed success under Amorim.\n\nUgarte made his name at Sporting, where in 2022-23 he topped the Portuguese charts for tackles and interceptions (179) as the chief destroyer in Amorim's double pivot.\n\nAmorim's wingers, who sit just behind the striker to form a box-shape with the two central midfielders, tend to be direct runners capable of pressing hard and weaving their way through the lines in the transition.\n\nIn other words, Amorim prefers the polar opposite of the mercurial Fernandes, a traditional number 10 whose free roaming might not work in such a fine-tuned system.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho, on the other hand, could be the perfect fit. He loves to dribble through a crowd, completing 41 progressive carries this campaign, not far off double that of any other United player.\n\nHowever, Rashford would need to recapture those 2022-23 levels, with his progressive ball carry figures only at 16 this season.\n\nViktor Gyokeres has been a revelation for Amorim, scoring 41 goals in 42 league games with a mixture of targeted runs, pressing intensity, and power in the penalty area; three attributes Ten Hag used to describe Rasmus Hojlund when he arrived at Old Trafford in August 2023.\n\nAmorim is more than willing to alter his tactical set-up to suit the strengths and limitations of his players, suggesting that even those players who don't look like an obvious fit could find a manager willing to bend for now... well apart from three at the back.",

        "headline": "Agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure a major move for winger Geovany Quenda.",
        "article_text": "Geovany Quenda is being pursued by a host of Europe’s biggest clubs including Manchester United and TEAMtalk can confirm his agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure him a major move.\n\nSporting Lisbon have a history of producing some of the world’s best talent and household names. They have another generation of talented young players coming through and Quenda is among them.\n\nQuenda’s name is one that many will have seen in the news as there have been multiple reports about clubs seeking to sign him.\n\nSources have confirmed to TEAMtalk that there is major interest in the teenager winger and he is being scouted by some of the best sides in the world.\n\nThe 17-year-old sensation has made 11 league appearances this season and fans have taken to him immediately. His talent is so great that super agent Mendes snapped him up and now represents him.\n\nMendes has been responsible for some of the biggest deals in the history of the game and was previously the representative of Man Utd icon Cristiano Ronaldo. He is now working to find the next move for Quenda and there is no shortage of options on the table.\n\nA move to the Premier League is a realistic option as scouts from most of the top six sides have been in attendance at Sporting games on multiple occasions this season. Indeed, TEAMtalk revealed on November 4 that Man Utd hold concrete interest in Quenda, who usually operates on the right flank.\n\nLiverpool are keeping tabs on the youngster’s development too, while Juventus are one of several European giants in the picture.\n\nSporting were keen to keep themselves in a strong position with the Portuguese winger and tied him down to a new contract in the summer. The deal he signed in July runs until the summer of 2027 and contains a release clause worth £84million (€100.9m / $106.3m).\n\nThat was a £50m rise from the exit clause in his previous deal and is one of the highest clauses amongst the Sporting squad.\n\nThis clause would be a problem for the likes of United, with the Old Trafford hierarchy keen to keep spending down while simultaneously getting the club back towards the top of the Prem.\n\nThere are some sources who state that the forward could go for less than his clause in the summer, however others are less convinced Sporting will allow him to go for anything short of the full amount.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford will be ‘fighting for their futures’ at United under new boss Ruben Amorim, it has been claimed.\n\nGiveMeSport state Shaw and Rashford must prove their worth to Amorim or risk being replaced.\n\nShaw needs to try and stay fit for a prolonged period after sustaining a number of injuries, while Rashford must get back to his goalscoring best as Amorim will not be as lenient as Erik ten Hag.\n\nSeparate reports claim United are ready to try again for Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.\n\nThe Red Devils agreed personal terms with Branthwaite over the summer but had two bids rejected by Everton.\n\nSporting director Dan Ashworth is now leading the chase and United are prepared to re-open talks.\n\nPROFILE: Who is Geovany Quenda?  \nBorn in Guinea-Bissau in April 2007, Quenda moved to Portugal as a child and joined Amadora-based club Damaiense at the age of eight.\n\nHe also spent two years in Benfica’s academy before joining their arch-rivals Sporting CP in 2021.\n\nIn February 2024, he started a Liga 3 game against Amora and became the youngest-ever player to play for Sporting’s reserve team at the age of 16.\n\nThe left-footed right-winger showcased his pace and his dribbling ability and caught the attention of first-team manager Ruben Amorim.\n\n“He can play in several positions, he has a lot of quality and irreverence. He is another option,” Amorim said after naming him on the bench for a Europa League tie against Atalanta in March 2024.\n\nQuenda has also shone on the international stage as his performances for Portugal at the 2024 UEFA European Under-17 Championship earned him a place in the Team of the Tournament.\n\nHe marked his senior debut for Sporting with a goal against Porto in August 2024 and became the youngest goalscorer in the club’s history at the age of 17 years and 95 days, overtaking the likes of Ronaldo and Simao.\n\nThe teenager then became the youngest Portuguese player to start a Champions League match during Sporting’s 2-0 win over Lille in September 2024.\n\nHe has also been called up to the senior Portugal squad and was an unused substitute in their 2-1 win over Scotland in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n“The national team coaches always say that age is not a factor. (Quenda) showed incredible personality, quality and adaptability,” Roberto Martinez said.\n\n“He’s a player who likes to make things difficult (for defenders). He has technical quality (that is) not normal for a 17-year-old. He’s now in Sporting’s first team and has shown incredible personality.”\n\nThe forward – who can also play as a wing-back – has since made two appearances for Portugal’s Under-21s and registered an assist in a 2-1 win over Andorra.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim to operate on more modest budget to end costly cycle.",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad as the club aims to end the damaging and costly cycle of mass overhauls.\n\nThe new United hierarchy have no plans under Amorim to rip up a squad they feel is capable of delivering far more and are determined to move away from a culture of persistent upheaval they believe to be financially unsustainable and destructive to coherent squad building.\n\nDenmark striker Rasmus Hojlund and England midfielder Mason Mount are cited as just two examples of players United are hoping can thrive in a new environment under the charismatic Portuguese, who will take charge of his first game as the club’s new head coach away to Ipswich Town on Sunday. Amorim took official charge of his first training session with United on Monday.\n\nUnited have averaged five new signings every summer for the past 10 years under four different managers with vastly different ideas of how they want to play. All have had little success to show for the huge expenditure.\n\nWhile Amorim is expected to be operating under a more modest transfer budget next summer than his predecessor Ten Hag did during his 2½-year reign, when he spent more than £600 million, United want to implement a more sustainable structure where waste is limited, the churn of players greatly reduced and more talent realised.\n\nUnited hope Amorim can inject new lease of life.\n\nUnited feel there are plenty of players in the squad who, with better coaching, attention and support in the right system and set-up, have a much higher ceiling than they may have shown previously. The club hope Amorim can unlock that potential.\n\nEqually, there is a feeling there may be more experienced players who also stand to benefit considerably from Amorim’s arrival and others who find they are given a new lease of life in potentially reimagined roles.\n\nWith losses before tax totalling £312.9 million over the past three seasons, United are under huge pressure to reduce costs to ensure continued compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and Uefa’s own financial sustainability regulations.\n\nThose pressures will become more acute if the club miss out on Champions League qualification for a second successive season and, with it, the vast broadcast revenues that come with playing in Europe’s premier club competition. In that scenario, United would also face a financial penalty under the terms of their kit deal with Adidas.\n\nUnited, who shed 250 staff jobs in the summer, are continuing to review costs across all areas of the club as they strive to reduce those losses. That includes the possibility of cutting in half the cash they give to the Manchester United Disabled Supporters’ Association, although there is no certainty at this stage that will happen.\n\nThe wider financial challenges will ensure a pressing need for United to sell well to raise money to reinvest next year and a sensible approach to buying after years of transfer-market failures and scattergun spending that have left little room for manoeuvre. Old Trafford sources insist it is imperative the club move away from the wasteful, inefficient transfer approach of the past and the cumulative damage of repeat mistakes by building a more sustainable model and structure.\n\nUnited are unlikely to be particularly active in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, players leave or injuries or other factors create a problem that has to be addressed.\n\nAmorim given time to assess his squad.\n\nDan Ashworth, the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, the technical director and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will give Amorim time to assess the squad and see how players adapt to his approach and methods before they start to make any definitive plans for next summer’s window and the type of players and areas they might want to target to supplement what is already there – in addition to who may go.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all out of contract next summer, as are Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo, although the club have options to extend both of those players’s deals by another 12 months.\n\nCasemiro and Tyrell Malacia enter the final 12 months of their contracts at the end of the season but with options for another year. Chelsea have an obligation to buy England winger Jadon Sancho, who is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge, next summer so long as the west-London club finish in the top 14 of the Premier League this season.\n\nAmorim takes over a United side who are 13th in the Premier League, albeit just four points off the top four, after the club’s poor start to the season under Ten Hag.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the Dutchman’s interim replacement, helped to stabilise results during a four-game spell in charge, including a 1-1 draw against Chelsea and 3-0 win over Leicester City in the league.\n\nAmorim spoke about playing “without fear” from day one and “winning time” and patience through victories and establishing a clear identity and idea that the fans can recognise and get behind.\n\nThe 39-year-old is expected to implement a change of system by adopting a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-3 formation, systems that brought him considerable success at Sporting.\n\nSeveral players whom Ten Hag was unable to call on this season are moving closer to first-team returns, including summer signing Leny Yoro and left-backs Luke Shaw and Malacia, while Amorim will soon hope to have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Maguire back after muscle injuries. There are fitness concerns, though, over Lisandro Martinez, who had to withdraw from the Argentina squad last week.",

        "article_text": "Leny Yoro is fully fit and gearing up for his Man United debut under new head coach Ruben Amorim this month.\n\nYoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night. Yoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left. Yoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6, and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday. Martinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City. \n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now. Shaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

        "headline": "Leny Yoro call, Marcus Rashford change - Ruben Amorim could spring five Manchester United surprises",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era.\n\nAmorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n### Rashford up top\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nRasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible.\n\nIn his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   Ruben Amorim has already found the answer to his first Manchester United selection dilemma\n*   Ruben Amorim takes decision with Leny Yoro at Manchester United",

        "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The _Manchester Evening News_ revealed two weeks ago that United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United since February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo, and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United can make stunning January transfer statement by hijacking Real Madrid plan. Ruben Amorim is on the hunt for a left wing-back for his Man Utd system and the ideal player could be available for nothing next summer.\n\nRecruitment is done a little differently at Manchester United these days, but it does feel like the new structure put in place by Ineos has yet to truly make its mark on the club.\n\nThe initial £52m deal to sign teenager Leny Yoro from Lille was the stand-out transfer of the summer and a statement of intent from United, beating Real Madrid and Liverpool to the signing of one of the most highly-rated teenagers in European football. But the wheels had been greased for that move before United's new football department was fully installed.\n\nAfter that, the signings had a relatively familiar feel, with two former Ajax players and a Dutch forward. The decision to push for Manuel Ugarte, a holding midfielder who wasn't top of Erik ten Hag's wish list, was at least a sign of flexibility and things operating a little differently.\n\nTen Hag's sacking, and replacing him with Ruben Amorim as the first United boss to be referred to as head coach rather than manager, completes the organisational flow chat at Carrington. Sporting director Dan Ashworth now heads up the football department, with Amorim reporting to him. Technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell are also involved in transfers.\n\nThere will be a limit to what they can do, certainly in January and perhaps even heading into the 2025 summer window. An outlay of £600m in three summers under Ten Hag has depleted resources, and there is an expectation that Amorim will start to get the most out of the talent already in place.\n\nUnited have made a financial loss for five years in a row and continue to feel the pressure of financial fair play rules instigated by UEFA and the Premier League, so we can expect a tightening of the belt under Sir Jim Ratcliffe for a little while. The purse strings could be loosened if Amorim can deliver Champions League football for next season.\n\nThat makes hunting for bargains and deals vital. If Amorim's priority remains a left wing-back, then there is an option that could be snapped up as soon as New Year's Day.\n\nFor now, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are the only options available in that area of the pitch. In training this week, Shaw has operated as a left-sided centre-back and Malacia as a wing-back, but both are returning from substantial injury layoffs. Amorim could be inventive and turn to Amad and Antony, but the feeling persists that he might look for a solution from outside in the long term.\n\nThat could be Alphonso Davies, with United credited with an interest in the 24-year-old as his contract at Bayern Munich ticks down. Davies' deal expires in the summer, and he has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.\n\nDavies' agent recently insisted reports of a deal between his client and Real Madrid were \"not true\" and said he had options, including staying at Bayern. United can officially approach the Canadian international from January 1.\n\nThe fast, athletic, and attacking Davies certainly looks a good fit for Amorim's system, and it would make sense for United to at least consider an approach. If they can beat Real at their own game and secure him on a free transfer, then it really would be a statement of intent from the club's new football structure.",

        "headline": "Manchester United make Sekou Kone plan after midfielder's injury scare",
        "article_text": "Man United signed Malian Sekou Kone in the summer and the midfielder has an exciting future at Old Trafford.\n\nKone was substituted last week.\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow. Another United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

There are just six weeks until the January transfer window reopens in the new year, which will give Amorim plenty of time to figure out whether he reinforcements will be needed.\n\nAfter spending more than £200million on transfers last summer, United could have a more restricted budget to operate with this time around. The club have also dished out around £35m in compensation.\n\nAround £10m was paid to Newcastle United for sporting director Dan Ashworth while around £17m will be handed out to Erik ten Hag in sacking pay-out.\n\nAhead of what could be a busy new year for the Reds nonetheless, the Manchester Evening News will keep you up to date with all the latest news and transfer gossip around United. A reunion between Amorim and his former player Viktor Gyokeres continues to do the rounds but whether that will happen, remains to be seen.\n\nMarcus Rashford must step up under Ruben Amorim or 'he’ll have a problem'. Former Man United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen believes Marcus Rashford's career is on the line under Ruben Amorim.\n\nSpeaking to TribalFootball.com, he said: \"Ruben Amorim’s arrival is a pivotal moment in the Manchester United career of Marcus Rashford. The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\nIt's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\n\nManchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023. Manchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nRuben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nInterest is growing in the Benfica star Orkun Kokcu who could reportedly be allowed to leave in the new year, according to reports. Caught Offside meanwhile, suggest that the Portuguese giants are looking for a fee of around €60-70million.\n\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nAnalysis has shown concerns for United's left-back position with Fabrizio Romano revealing that Man United 'will continue' monitoring Alphonso Davies as the left-back position is reportedly a department the club has made a priority.\n\nRuben Amorim has been made aware of the situation within the club and is expected to utilize his connections and experiences from previous management roles to adjust Manchester United for the better in a hurry as quick as possible. \n\nFinally, reports in Spain claim that United have 'launched an improved bid' to bring Barcelona centre-back Jules Kounde in January. The France international has been with the Spanish giants since 2022 and has 105 appearances to date. It's said Ruben Amorim sees him as a player who would be suited to play in the right wing-back slot.",

        "article_text": "Optimism has returned to Manchester United before a ball has been kicked under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nWhat does someone who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting make of him? “His drive to succeed is incredible,” they said. “He’s ruthless. He doesn’t give a s**t what people say or who players are.”\n\nThat will be music to Manchester United supporters’ ears. The illuminating footage of Amorim in the thick of it during his first team training session at Carrington has further fuelled excitement.\n\nTraining sessions are sensitive and United highlighted that behind the erection of a wall earlier this season that shielded the first team’s pitch. On Monday evening, seven minutes of Amorim timing attacks from back to front was aired. It confirmed Amorim is indoctrinating the players in the ways of his much-hyped 3-4-3, with potential early indicators as to who will start at Ipswich Town on Sunday. There was also the rare sight of United players sprinting towards their own goal.\n\nLeny Yoro was informed on Monday he was down to start for the Under 21s in the National League Cup at Altrincham on Tuesday evening. His absence was owed to Amorim. Yoro was in the United defensive triumvirate for Amorim’s maiden session.\n\nOf all the post-Ferguson managerial appointments, only Jose Mourinho’s in 2016 rivals the buzz around his compatriot. At the time of Erik ten Hag’s overdue dismissal, it seemed unlikely United would settle on a replacement to completely unify the fanbase yet they have achieved that with Amorim.\n\nIt helped that the 39-year-old was visible in the days before United confirmed his imminent arrival, affably indulging the handful of English media representatives at his press conferences in Lisbon. More flocked to his briefings the following week as Sporting gave Manchester City a shellacking in the Champions League. United’s best result in Europe that week was not against PAOK.\n\nThe personable Amorim pressed the flesh during his tour of Old Trafford last Thursday and a handful of fortunate visitors’ own tour coincided with his. Optimism at United has not been this rife or widespread since the FA Cup final, an anomalous high among innumerable lows.\n\nIt makes it all the more peculiar that Amorim will not be introduced at Old Trafford today. He sat at the same press conference seat last week that Ten Hag did a day after the sulphurous 2021-22 campaign ended. Since David Moyes, every permanent or interim United manager has been afforded an introductory press conference at Old Trafford. In the Zoom era, Ralf Rangnick was deemed worthy of a first in-person press conference in 21 months. The Number 7 suite was opened for Mourinho, Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nA paint-by-numbers interview by in-house media with Amorim, conducted last Thursday evening, was published around 24 hours later at 7pm on Friday, a graveyard slot in the daily news cycle. United gave the impression they were burying bad news when Amorim’s arrival is only behind the FA Cup victories over Liverpool and City for their feel-good story of the calendar year.\n\nClub sources say Amorim was deliberately held back to allow him to settle into his new routine, rather than subject him to two press conferences before his first match in charge. He will hold court at Carrington at 1.30pm on Friday.\n\nSome at United are reluctant to be overly positive. They have seen this all before with a new manager, as those who cover them have, too. Figures at the club have welcomed Amorim's energy and his presence has been uplifting. \"He has struck all the right notes,\" one source said.\n\n\"He's more charismatic and empathetic with players and the press than Ten Hag,\" someone else who knows Amorim said. \"He will answer everything at a press conference. He tends to joke.\"\n\nAmorim worked closely with the Sporting president Frederico Varandas and sporting director Hugo Vian. His confidants believe a similar rapport is required with the United hierarchy. Amorim has spoken about his \"connection\" with chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nPortuguese sources feel Amorim will make tweaks to his anticipated 3-4-3 system. The majority of United's centre backs are well versed in the back three set-up while Diogo Dalot operated in a 3-4-3 for Porto B when United scouted him.\n\nAmorim came \"very close\" to succeeding Jurgen Klopp when Liverpool whittled down their shortlist of candidates to Amorim and Arne Slot. Manchester City earmarked Amorim as Pep Guardiola's heir had he left Manchester after ten years. He will encounter Guardiola again in next month's derby.\n\nLike Mourinho, Amorim is holed up in The Lowry Hotel, though his residency is unlikely to rival his mentor's as he is already house-hunting. United security staff have ferried Amorim to Carrington every day this week.\n\nThere is a curious sub-plot to Amorim's United debut at Portman Road. In the opposite dugout, there will be another highly-regarded 30-something coach who was a candidate to replace Ten Hag this year. Kieran McKenna is also another Mourinho protégé, having been promoted to first team coach at United in July 2018 three months after Amorim’s internship at Carrington.\n\nHad United come calling for McKenna a second time last month then his release clause would have been more expensive than Amorim’s prudent €10million buyout. Some of the more entitled United players found McKenna’s methods to be too officious whereas the younger squad members were more receptive.\n\nOne narrative can be scrapped from this weekend’s fixture. The last time United were at Portman Road in May 2002 the game was settled by Ruud van Nistelrooy. Van Nistelrooy gained “closure” with his appreciation for the United supporters at full-time against Leicester two weeks ago. Then Amorim closed the door. There was that ruthlessness, hours after Amorim's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport.\n\nThere was something else Amorim’s former colleague at Sporting mentioned: “He will 100% succeed.”",

        "article_text": "Manchester United player ratings this season so far as six get 7/10 and one gets a 2 - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United have had their worst-ever start to a Premier League season but some individuals have still performed respectably.\n\nA third of the way into the season and Manchester United are still in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nUnited have lost five of their 11 league fixtures but Ruud van Nistelrooy's uplifting four-match stint as caretaker manager has ensured new head coach Ruben Amorim will inherit a more buoyant squad.\n\nDespite United's 13th-place status, they have a League Cup quarter-final next month, have four games to secure automatic qualification for the Europa League round-of-16 and will start their defence of the FA Cup in January.\n\nAmad, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro regained form under Van Nistelrooy while Alejandro Garnacho tallied two more goals under the Dutchman. Here are how the United players have rated this season so far:\n\n**Andre Onana** One of a handful of performers who has had a respectable season. Made some world-class saves (Crystal Palace and Fenerbahce) and important stops (Southampton and Porto). 7\n\n**Diogo Dalot** After a reasonable 2023-24, Dalot is in a rut. He has played often enough at left back to do better there yet he is underperforming on both sides. Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui** The best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt** Had some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez** Seldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans** Ten appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire** Missed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof** Belatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo** Weary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro** The first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte** Leicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen** Already started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes** Football’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad** A decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho** United’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford** When he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee** Netted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._\n\n**Rasmus Hojlund** Two goals in 11 appearances marks a startling start to his second season at the club. Unlike last term, Hojlund is struggling to get chances and his lack of presence is a problem. 4",

        "article_text": "Manchester United transfer news as Dan Ashworth starts work on the January transfer window to bolster Ruben Amorim's squad.\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nUnited have invested in centre-forwards in the last two years with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee arriving. However, the latter has struggled to make an impact in England since his £36.5million move from Bologna.\n\nRuben Amorim's appointment as Erik ten Hag's successor has led to speculation linking United with a new centre-forward. Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres is a popular name among the list of candidates but it appears alternatives are now being considered.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer. During the recent international break, Kolo Muani remained adamant at breaking into Luis Enrique's XI.\n\n\"You have to keep your mental strength up, it's up to me to continue working so that the coach trusts me,\" he told Telefoot. \"It's part of my history. I've always worked, I've never had things easy.\n\n\"I have to work harder, make an impression when he calls on me. It's up to me to give my all so that he trusts me.\"",

He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker.

I know, I feel it. I will wait.

Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper. I've heard they're going to be found not guilty of all of them [the charges].\n\n\"It's just a whisper, it's unconfirmed.

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

        "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure. \"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. 'Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!' he wrote on Instagram. 'Thank you, Orlando.'\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n'“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,' Neville said.\n\n'He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n'This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n'They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.'\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: 'For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n'We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n'If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,' he said. 'Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.'\n\nHe added: 'Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.'\n\n'If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.'",

In fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'. With that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro. Porro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club. It is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him. The report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles. Speaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim. “He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,",

This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option. Any reports suggesting otherwise are incorrect.”",

        "article_text": "Manchester United’s players already have a ‘nickname’ for head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim, 39, arrived at the club’s Carrington Training Centre on Monday and was greeted by several members of the Red Devils’ hierarchy – including sporting director Dan Ashworth, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nOn the same day, he took charge of training for the first time, with the Portuguese having just ten senior players available due to the ongoing international break.\n\nAs a result, several academy players joined in the session.\n\nAmad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town.\n\nFans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up.\n\nThe Sun Sport reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence.\n\n“Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained.\n\n“Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence.\n\n“There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own.\n\n“The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

        "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nHe also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\n“When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained.\n\n“Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added.\n\n“I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along.\n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days.\n\n“He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\nRoy Keane leaves The Overlap panel in stitches with comment to Jill Scott\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.",

        "article_text": "**Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.** An official statement from the BBC confirmed that Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour. Jenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'. And now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband. On Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband. According to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family. “My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy. “Now I just want to move forward. “Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.” Despite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future. \"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added. \"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future. “He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.” Jermaine Jenas and Ellie Penfold got married on 11 June 2011. When details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke with The Sun about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie. He said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault. “The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family. “There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.” “Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human. “When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

We will see [about a transfer].\"\n\nThe 25-year-old’s current Brentford contract is set to run until June 2026.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has opened up on the regret that his wife \"throws in my face every day\".\n\nThe 39-year-old, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday as the Reds come up against Ipswich Town, has enjoyed a remarkable rise since taking over at third-tier Portuguese sider Casa Pia in 2018.\n\nHe went on to impress at Braga, the club he spent a year at during his playing career, before Sporting triggered the €10 million (£8.3m) clause in his contract. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n\"I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT.\"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\nGareth Southgate on England injury crisis\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

        "article_text": "Media in Uruguay have spoken out about Darwin Nunez after the Liverpool star was taken off early during the international match against Brazil.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil and Uruguay faced off in a qualifying match for the 2026 World Cup in Salvador, Brazil.\n\nThe match ended as a 1-1 draw with goals from Uruguayan Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde and Brazil's Gerson.\n\nLiverpool striker Nunez started the match for the visitors but was taken off over half-time, and now Uruguayan media have revealed exactly why.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, Uruguay manager Marcelo Bielsa decided to replace Nunez with Rodrigo Aguirre as he had been ineffective in the match up until the break.\n\nUruguayan media later confirmed that the substitution had been a tactical decision and that the 25-year-old had not suffered an injury early in the game.\n\nLocal outlet El Observador rated the striker's performance as a five out of ten, praising his defensive work while noting that he did not have a single shot on goal, in part due to a lack of service from his teammates.\n\nUruguayan newspaper El Pais also handed Nunez the same rating for his performance in the match, writing: \"Good work with his back to the goal. Precise in his first touches. He came off after 45 minutes of the first half.\"\n\nLiverpool fans will be happy to see that their man up front only played half of the match on Tuesday as it remains likely that he will start for their trip to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday.\n\nAfter traveling to Southampton, Liverpool will face a tough set of fixtures including back to back home matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nDarwin Nunez started both of Uruguay's matches over the international break.\n\nWith Diogo Jota still recovering from an injury sustained during the match with Chelsea, it is likely that Nunez will start, or at least feature, in all three of Liverpool's next matches. Speaking before the international break, Arne Slot confirmed when Jota is expected to return, saying: “We expect him back after the break. The first weeks after the break, I always say there is privacy about the injury. He will be back one or two weeks after the break.”",

        "article_text": "**Ruben Amorim has been told about a player in the Manchester United ranks who is \"impossible to ignore\" as he prepares to take charge of his first game.** After succeeding Erik ten Hag as the next head coach, Amorim has some big decisions to make in the coming months when it comes to team selection. Amad Diallo is set for a 'prominent' role under the new manager, according to journalist Dean Jones, who says Amorim is 'excited' by the winger's technical ability, work off the ball, and creativity in the final third. We will get more of an insight into his thinking on Sunday afternoon, when United travel to Portman Road to take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town. But ahead of the Premier League clash, Amorim has been urged to take a look at one of their academy prospects. Earlier this week, United under-21s maintained their unbeaten record in the National League Cup with a 4-0 win over Altrincham as highly-rated striker Ethan Ennis scored a hat-trick. Ennis, who joined the Reds from Liverpool in 2021, becoming the first player in 57 years to do so, has netted nine goals and two assists in 12 academy appearances this season. And the 19-year-old forward has been tipped to push for a spot in the first team by Steven Railston of the Manchester Evening News. \"So what you might be wondering, could Ennis be pushing to make his first-team debut? The answer is he should be,\" he said. \"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\" Ennis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. He could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",

        "article_text": "**Jamie Vardy's true feelings about wife Rebekah Vardy's feud with Coleen Rooney have been revealed after a couple of digs at her WAG rival's appearance in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.**\n\nColeen, wife of former Manchester United and England star Wayne, is among the high-profile contestants for the 24th edition of the ITV show. She is rumoured to be earning a joint-record £1.5 million for heading into the jungle and has already been discussing her relationship with one of the Premier League's best ever players.\n\nAnd the row with Vardy has been reignited, with plenty of jibes being made by hosts Ant and Dec and Coleen briefly talking about the 'Wagatha Christie' 2022 trial.\n\nRebekah, a former I'm a Celeb contestant back in 2017, couldn't help but respond on Instagram, writing: \"That feeling when you are living rent free in people's heads [laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe 42-year-old is serving as a columnist for The Sun on jungle affairs and in a video doing the rounds, described Coleen as \"the gift that keeps on giving\" after her boat sank twice in episode one.\n\nFans have wondered what Leicester City striker Vardy thinks about his other half's antics but according to Rebekah, he doesn't mind it at all and is supportive of her actions.\n\nThe mum of five also claimed any abuse subjected to him on the pitch spurs him on.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Jamie is mad at me for speaking out, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,\" she said, as per The Mirror.\n\n\"He’s encouraging me, saying, ‘Give it to her, get the truth out there’. He loves it that she’s back getting headlines. The more stick he gets from the stands in football, the better he plays.\"\n\nJamie Vardy's stance on Rebekah Vardy's feud with Coleen Rooney has been revealed. Image: Getty\n\nIn a recent column for The Sun, Rebekah accused Coleen of copying her in going into I'm a Celeb and claiming \"she always wanted my life\".\n\nVardy lost the well-publicised defamation trial and after she was ordered to cover a hefty portion Coleen's legal expenses along with her costs, were estimated to total £3 million.",

        "headline": "Bundesliga expert tips one of 'world's best players' to sign for Liverpool and tells fans to bet on it happening",
        "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. \n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

        "article_text": "Sporting star Ousmane Diomande has spoken with Ruben Amorim about joining Manchester United and is growing increasingly keen on a move to Old Trafford.\n\nHaving joined Sporting from Danish outfit Midtjylland in January 2023, Diomande has quickly earned a reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Portuguese football.\n\nDiomande made 26 appearances across an eye-catching debut season in the Primeira Liga, playing a key role as Sporting – led by United’s new head coach Amorim – stormed to an historic 20th league title last term.\n\nAnd while Diomande’s Sporting career is still in its infancy, speculation is mounting that the centre-back could be set for a big-money switch away from the Jose Alvalade Stadium before too long.\n\nAccording to Sky, Diomande is ‘sure to be one of the attractions of the next two transfer windows, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal all battling it out for the Ivory Coast international.\n\nDiomande has been firmly on City’s radar since his Midtjylland days and the Premier League champions are targeting the Sporting sensation as a ‘priority’.\n\nCity’s incoming director of football Hugo Viana – who will succeed Txiki Begiristain at the end of the season – has already prepared a plan of action to convince Sporting’s president, Frederico Varandas, to part with Diomande.\n\nHowever, the report states that United are determined not to fall behind their bitter rivals in the transfer race and Amorim has already spoken with Diomande over the prospect of following him to the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nIt’s claimed Diomande ‘knows it would be beneficial for his development’ to continue with Amorim and he is therefore ‘leaning towards’ United, though City are refusing to give up hope in their pursuit of the centre-half.\n\nDiomande currently has an €80million (£66m) release clause in his deal with Sporting, though the Primeira Liga outfit recognise it may be unrealistic to expect an offer close to that figure.\n\nThe towering Ivorian, who stands at 6 ft 3 in, is tied into a contract with Sporting until 2027.",

        "headline": "Agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure a major move for winger Geovany Quenda.",
        "article_text": "Geovany Quenda is being pursued by a host of Europe’s biggest clubs including Manchester United and TEAMtalk can confirm his agent Jorge Mendes is trying to secure him a major move.\n\nSporting Lisbon have a history of producing some of the world’s best talent and household names. They have another generation of talented young players coming through and Quenda is among them.\n\nQuenda’s name is one that many will have seen in the news as there have been multiple reports about clubs seeking to sign him.\n\nSources have confirmed to TEAMtalk that there is major interest in the teenager winger and he is being scouted by some of the best sides in the world.\n\nThe 17-year-old sensation has made 11 league appearances this season and fans have taken to him immediately. His talent is so great that super agent Mendes snapped him up and now represents him.\n\nMendes has been responsible for some of the biggest deals in the history of the game and was previously the representative of Man Utd icon Cristiano Ronaldo. He is now working to find the next move for Quenda and there is no shortage of options on the table.\n\nA move to the Premier League is a realistic option as scouts from most of the top six sides have been in attendance at Sporting games on multiple occasions this season. Indeed, TEAMtalk revealed on November 4 that Man Utd hold concrete interest in Quenda, who usually operates on the right flank.\n\nLiverpool are keeping tabs on the youngster’s development too, while Juventus are one of several European giants in the picture.\n\nSporting were keen to keep themselves in a strong position with the Portuguese winger and tied him down to a new contract in the summer. The deal he signed in July runs until the summer of 2027 and contains a release clause worth £84million (€100.9m / $106.3m).\n\nThat was a £50m rise from the exit clause in his previous deal and is one of the highest clauses amongst the Sporting squad.\n\nThis clause would be a problem for the likes of United, with the Old Trafford hierarchy keen to keep spending down while simultaneously getting the club back towards the top of the Prem.\n\nThere are some sources who state that the forward could go for less than his clause in the summer, however others are less convinced Sporting will allow him to go for anything short of the full amount.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford will be ‘fighting for their futures’ at United under new boss Ruben Amorim, it has been claimed.\n\nGiveMeSport state Shaw and Rashford must prove their worth to Amorim or risk being replaced.\n\nShaw needs to try and stay fit for a prolonged period after sustaining a number of injuries, while Rashford must get back to his goalscoring best as Amorim will not be as lenient as Erik ten Hag.\n\nSeparate reports claim United are ready to try again for Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.\n\nThe Red Devils agreed personal terms with Branthwaite over the summer but had two bids rejected by Everton.\n\nSporting director Dan Ashworth is now leading the chase and United are prepared to re-open talks.\n\nPROFILE: Who is Geovany Quenda?  \nBorn in Guinea-Bissau in April 2007, Quenda moved to Portugal as a child and joined Amadora-based club Damaiense at the age of eight.\n\nHe also spent two years in Benfica’s academy before joining their arch-rivals Sporting CP in 2021.\n\nIn February 2024, he started a Liga 3 game against Amora and became the youngest-ever player to play for Sporting’s reserve team at the age of 16.\n\nThe left-footed right-winger showcased his pace and his dribbling ability and caught the attention of first-team manager Ruben Amorim.\n\n“He can play in several positions, he has a lot of quality and irreverence. He is another option,” Amorim said after naming him on the bench for a Europa League tie against Atalanta in March 2024.\n\nQuenda has also shone on the international stage as his performances for Portugal at the 2024 UEFA European Under-17 Championship earned him a place in the Team of the Tournament.\n\nHe marked his senior debut for Sporting with a goal against Porto in August 2024 and became the youngest goalscorer in the club’s history at the age of 17 years and 95 days, overtaking the likes of Ronaldo and Simao.\n\nThe teenager then became the youngest Portuguese player to start a Champions League match during Sporting’s 2-0 win over Lille in September 2024.\n\nHe has also been called up to the senior Portugal squad and was an unused substitute in their 2-1 win over Scotland in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n“The national team coaches always say that age is not a factor. (Quenda) showed incredible personality, quality and adaptability,” Roberto Martinez said.\n\n“He’s a player who likes to make things difficult (for defenders). He has technical quality (that is) not normal for a 17-year-old. He’s now in Sporting’s first team and has shown incredible personality.”\n\nThe forward – who can also play as a wing-back – has since made two appearances for Portugal’s Under-21s and registered an assist in a 2-1 win over Andorra.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim to operate on more modest budget to end costly cycle.",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad as the club aims to end the damaging and costly cycle of mass overhauls.\n\nThe new United hierarchy have no plans under Amorim to rip up a squad they feel is capable of delivering far more and are determined to move away from a culture of persistent upheaval they believe to be financially unsustainable and destructive to coherent squad building.\n\nDenmark striker Rasmus Hojlund and England midfielder Mason Mount are cited as just two examples of players United are hoping can thrive in a new environment under the charismatic Portuguese, who will take charge of his first game as the club’s new head coach away to Ipswich Town on Sunday. Amorim took official charge of his first training session with United on Monday.\n\nUnited have averaged five new signings every summer for the past 10 years under four different managers with vastly different ideas of how they want to play. All have had little success to show for the huge expenditure.\n\nWhile Amorim is expected to be operating under a more modest transfer budget next summer than his predecessor Ten Hag did during his 2½-year reign, when he spent more than £600 million, United want to implement a more sustainable structure where waste is limited, the churn of players greatly reduced and more talent realised.\n\nUnited hope Amorim can inject new lease of life.\n\nUnited feel there are plenty of players in the squad who, with better coaching, attention and support in the right system and set-up, have a much higher ceiling than they may have shown previously. The club hope Amorim can unlock that potential.\n\nEqually, there is a feeling there may be more experienced players who also stand to benefit considerably from Amorim’s arrival and others who find they are given a new lease of life in potentially reimagined roles.\n\nWith losses before tax totalling £312.9 million over the past three seasons, United are under huge pressure to reduce costs to ensure continued compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and Uefa’s own financial sustainability regulations.\n\nThose pressures will become more acute if the club miss out on Champions League qualification for a second successive season and, with it, the vast broadcast revenues that come with playing in Europe’s premier club competition. In that scenario, United would also face a financial penalty under the terms of their kit deal with Adidas.\n\nUnited, who shed 250 staff jobs in the summer, are continuing to review costs across all areas of the club as they strive to reduce those losses. That includes the possibility of cutting in half the cash they give to the Manchester United Disabled Supporters’ Association, although there is no certainty at this stage that will happen.\n\nThe wider financial challenges will ensure a pressing need for United to sell well to raise money to reinvest next year and a sensible approach to buying after years of transfer-market failures and scattergun spending that have left little room for manoeuvre. Old Trafford sources insist it is imperative the club move away from the wasteful, inefficient transfer approach of the past and the cumulative damage of repeat mistakes by building a more sustainable model and structure.\n\nUnited are unlikely to be particularly active in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, players leave or injuries or other factors create a problem that has to be addressed.\n\nAmorim given time to assess his squad.\n\nDan Ashworth, the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, the technical director and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will give Amorim time to assess the squad and see how players adapt to his approach and methods before they start to make any definitive plans for next summer’s window and the type of players and areas they might want to target to supplement what is already there – in addition to who may go.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all out of contract next summer, as are Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo, although the club have options to extend both of those players’s deals by another 12 months.\n\nCasemiro and Tyrell Malacia enter the final 12 months of their contracts at the end of the season but with options for another year. Chelsea have an obligation to buy England winger Jadon Sancho, who is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge, next summer so long as the west-London club finish in the top 14 of the Premier League this season.\n\nAmorim takes over a United side who are 13th in the Premier League, albeit just four points off the top four, after the club’s poor start to the season under Ten Hag.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the Dutchman’s interim replacement, helped to stabilise results during a four-game spell in charge, including a 1-1 draw against Chelsea and 3-0 win over Leicester City in the league.\n\nAmorim spoke about playing “without fear” from day one and “winning time” and patience through victories and establishing a clear identity and idea that the fans can recognise and get behind.\n\nThe 39-year-old is expected to implement a change of system by adopting a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-3 formation, systems that brought him considerable success at Sporting.\n\nSeveral players whom Ten Hag was unable to call on this season are moving closer to first-team returns, including summer signing Leny Yoro and left-backs Luke Shaw and Malacia, while Amorim will soon hope to have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Maguire back after muscle injuries. There are fitness concerns, though, over Lisandro Martinez, who had to withdraw from the Argentina squad last week.",

        "headline": "Leny Yoro call, Marcus Rashford change - Ruben Amorim could spring five Manchester United surprises",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era.\n\nAmorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n### Rashford up top\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nRasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible.\n\nIn his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   Ruben Amorim has already found the answer to his first Manchester United selection dilemma\n*   Ruben Amorim takes decision with Leny Yoro at Manchester United",

        "article_text": "Manchester United can make stunning January transfer statement by hijacking Real Madrid plan. Ruben Amorim is on the hunt for a left wing-back for his Man Utd system and the ideal player could be available for nothing next summer.\n\nRecruitment is done a little differently at Manchester United these days, but it does feel like the new structure put in place by Ineos has yet to truly make its mark on the club.\n\nThe initial £52m deal to sign teenager Leny Yoro from Lille was the stand-out transfer of the summer and a statement of intent from United, beating Real Madrid and Liverpool to the signing of one of the most highly-rated teenagers in European football. But the wheels had been greased for that move before United's new football department was fully installed.\n\nAfter that, the signings had a relatively familiar feel, with two former Ajax players and a Dutch forward. The decision to push for Manuel Ugarte, a holding midfielder who wasn't top of Erik ten Hag's wish list, was at least a sign of flexibility and things operating a little differently.\n\nTen Hag's sacking, and replacing him with Ruben Amorim as the first United boss to be referred to as head coach rather than manager, completes the organisational flow chat at Carrington. Sporting director Dan Ashworth now heads up the football department, with Amorim reporting to him. Technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell are also involved in transfers.\n\nThere will be a limit to what they can do, certainly in January and perhaps even heading into the 2025 summer window. An outlay of £600m in three summers under Ten Hag has depleted resources, and there is an expectation that Amorim will start to get the most out of the talent already in place.\n\nUnited have made a financial loss for five years in a row and continue to feel the pressure of financial fair play rules instigated by UEFA and the Premier League, so we can expect a tightening of the belt under Sir Jim Ratcliffe for a little while. The purse strings could be loosened if Amorim can deliver Champions League football for next season.\n\nThat makes hunting for bargains and deals vital. If Amorim's priority remains a left wing-back, then there is an option that could be snapped up as soon as New Year's Day.\n\nFor now, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are the only options available in that area of the pitch. In training this week, Shaw has operated as a left-sided centre-back and Malacia as a wing-back, but both are returning from substantial injury layoffs. Amorim could be inventive and turn to Amad and Antony, but the feeling persists that he might look for a solution from outside in the long term.\n\nThat could be Alphonso Davies, with United credited with an interest in the 24-year-old as his contract at Bayern Munich ticks down. Davies' deal expires in the summer, and he has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.\n\nDavies' agent recently insisted reports of a deal between his client and Real Madrid were \"not true\" and said he had options, including staying at Bayern. United can officially approach the Canadian international from January 1.\n\nThe fast, athletic, and attacking Davies certainly looks a good fit for Amorim's system, and it would make sense for United to at least consider an approach. If they can beat Real at their own game and secure him on a free transfer, then it really would be a statement of intent from the club's new football structure.",

        "article_text": "Man United signed Malian Sekou Kone in the summer and the midfielder has an exciting future at Old Trafford.\n\nKone was substituted last week.\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow. Another United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

There are just six weeks until the January transfer window reopens in the new year, which will give Amorim plenty of time to figure out whether he reinforcements will be needed.\n\nAfter spending more than £200million on transfers last summer, United could have a more restricted budget to operate with this time around. The club have also dished out around £35m in compensation.\n\nAround £10m was paid to Newcastle United for sporting director Dan Ashworth while around £17m will be handed out to Erik ten Hag in sacking pay-out.\n\nAhead of what could be a busy new year for the Reds nonetheless, the Manchester Evening News will keep you up to date with all the latest news and transfer gossip around United. A reunion between Amorim and his former player Viktor Gyokeres continues to do the rounds but whether that will happen, remains to be seen.\n\nMarcus Rashford must step up under Ruben Amorim or 'he’ll have a problem'. Former Man United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen believes Marcus Rashford's career is on the line under Ruben Amorim.\n\nSpeaking to TribalFootball.com, he said: \"Ruben Amorim’s arrival is a pivotal moment in the Manchester United career of Marcus Rashford. The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\nIt's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\n\nManchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023. Manchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nRuben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nInterest is growing in the Benfica star Orkun Kokcu who could reportedly be allowed to leave in the new year, according to reports. Caught Offside meanwhile, suggest that the Portuguese giants are looking for a fee of around €60-70million.\n\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nAnalysis has shown concerns for United's left-back position with Fabrizio Romano revealing that Man United 'will continue' monitoring Alphonso Davies as the left-back position is reportedly a department the club has made a priority.\n\nRuben Amorim has been made aware of the situation within the club and is expected to utilize his connections and experiences from previous management roles to adjust Manchester United for the better in a hurry as quick as possible. \n\nFinally, reports in Spain claim that United have 'launched an improved bid' to bring Barcelona centre-back Jules Kounde in January. The France international has been with the Spanish giants since 2022 and has 105 appearances to date. It's said Ruben Amorim sees him as a player who would be suited to play in the right wing-back slot.",

        "headline": "'He doesn't give a s**t' - why Ruben Amorim sources believe he will succeed at Manchester United",
        "article_text": "Optimism has returned to Manchester United before a ball has been kicked under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nWhat does someone who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting make of him? “His drive to succeed is incredible,” they said. “He’s ruthless. He doesn’t give a s**t what people say or who players are.”\n\nThat will be music to Manchester United supporters’ ears. The illuminating footage of Amorim in the thick of it during his first team training session at Carrington has further fuelled excitement.\n\nTraining sessions are sensitive and United highlighted that behind the erection of a wall earlier this season that shielded the first team’s pitch. On Monday evening, seven minutes of Amorim timing attacks from back to front was aired. It confirmed Amorim is indoctrinating the players in the ways of his much-hyped 3-4-3, with potential early indicators as to who will start at Ipswich Town on Sunday. There was also the rare sight of United players sprinting towards their own goal.\n\nLeny Yoro was informed on Monday he was down to start for the Under 21s in the National League Cup at Altrincham on Tuesday evening. His absence was owed to Amorim. Yoro was in the United defensive triumvirate for Amorim’s maiden session.\n\nOf all the post-Ferguson managerial appointments, only Jose Mourinho’s in 2016 rivals the buzz around his compatriot. At the time of Erik ten Hag’s overdue dismissal, it seemed unlikely United would settle on a replacement to completely unify the fanbase yet they have achieved that with Amorim.\n\nIt helped that the 39-year-old was visible in the days before United confirmed his imminent arrival, affably indulging the handful of English media representatives at his press conferences in Lisbon. More flocked to his briefings the following week as Sporting gave Manchester City a shellacking in the Champions League. United’s best result in Europe that week was not against PAOK.\n\nThe personable Amorim pressed the flesh during his tour of Old Trafford last Thursday and a handful of fortunate visitors’ own tour coincided with his. Optimism at United has not been this rife or widespread since the FA Cup final, an anomalous high among innumerable lows.\n\nIt makes it all the more peculiar that Amorim will not be introduced at Old Trafford today. He sat at the same press conference seat last week that Ten Hag did a day after the sulphurous 2021-22 campaign ended. Since David Moyes, every permanent or interim United manager has been afforded an introductory press conference at Old Trafford. In the Zoom era, Ralf Rangnick was deemed worthy of a first in-person press conference in 21 months. The Number 7 suite was opened for Mourinho, Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nA paint-by-numbers interview by in-house media with Amorim, conducted last Thursday evening, was published around 24 hours later at 7pm on Friday, a graveyard slot in the daily news cycle. United gave the impression they were burying bad news when Amorim’s arrival is only behind the FA Cup victories over Liverpool and City for their feel-good story of the calendar year.\n\nClub sources say Amorim was deliberately held back to allow him to settle into his new routine, rather than subject him to two press conferences before his first match in charge. He will hold court at Carrington at 1.30pm on Friday.\n\nSome at United are reluctant to be overly positive. They have seen this all before with a new manager, as those who cover them have, too. Figures at the club have welcomed Amorim's energy and his presence has been uplifting. \"He has struck all the right notes,\" one source said.\n\n\"He's more charismatic and empathetic with players and the press than Ten Hag,\" someone else who knows Amorim said. \"He will answer everything at a press conference. He tends to joke.\"\n\nAmorim worked closely with the Sporting president Frederico Varandas and sporting director Hugo Vian. His confidants believe a similar rapport is required with the United hierarchy. Amorim has spoken about his \"connection\" with chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nPortuguese sources feel Amorim will make tweaks to his anticipated 3-4-3 system. The majority of United's centre backs are well versed in the back three set-up while Diogo Dalot operated in a 3-4-3 for Porto B when United scouted him.\n\nAmorim came \"very close\" to succeeding Jurgen Klopp when Liverpool whittled down their shortlist of candidates to Amorim and Arne Slot. Manchester City earmarked Amorim as Pep Guardiola's heir had he left Manchester after ten years. He will encounter Guardiola again in next month's derby.\n\nLike Mourinho, Amorim is holed up in The Lowry Hotel, though his residency is unlikely to rival his mentor's as he is already house-hunting. United security staff have ferried Amorim to Carrington every day this week.\n\nThere is a curious sub-plot to Amorim's United debut at Portman Road. In the opposite dugout, there will be another highly-regarded 30-something coach who was a candidate to replace Ten Hag this year. Kieran McKenna is also another Mourinho protégé, having been promoted to first team coach at United in July 2018 three months after Amorim’s internship at Carrington.\n\nHad United come calling for McKenna a second time last month then his release clause would have been more expensive than Amorim’s prudent €10million buyout. Some of the more entitled United players found McKenna’s methods to be too officious whereas the younger squad members were more receptive.\n\nOne narrative can be scrapped from this weekend’s fixture. The last time United were at Portman Road in May 2002 the game was settled by Ruud van Nistelrooy. Van Nistelrooy gained “closure” with his appreciation for the United supporters at full-time against Leicester two weeks ago. Then Amorim closed the door. There was that ruthlessness, hours after Amorim's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport.\n\nThere was something else Amorim’s former colleague at Sporting mentioned: “He will 100% succeed.”",

Made some world-class saves (Crystal Palace and Fenerbahce) and important stops (Southampton and Porto). 7\n\n**Diogo Dalot** After a reasonable 2023-24, Dalot is in a rut. He has played often enough at left back to do better there yet he is underperforming on both sides. Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui** The best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt** Had some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez** Seldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans** Ten appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire** Missed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof** Belatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo** Weary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro** The first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte** Leicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen** Already started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes** Football’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad** A decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho** United’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford** When he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee** Netted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._\n\n**Rasmus Hojlund** Two goals in 11 appearances marks a startling start to his second season at the club. Unlike last term, Hojlund is struggling to get chances and his lack of presence is a problem. 4",

        "article_text": "Manchester United transfer news as Dan Ashworth starts work on the January transfer window to bolster Ruben Amorim's squad.\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nUnited have invested in centre-forwards in the last two years with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee arriving. However, the latter has struggled to make an impact in England since his £36.5million move from Bologna.\n\nRuben Amorim's appointment as Erik ten Hag's successor has led to speculation linking United with a new centre-forward. Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres is a popular name among the list of candidates but it appears alternatives are now being considered.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer. During the recent international break, Kolo Muani remained adamant at breaking into Luis Enrique's XI.\n\n\"You have to keep your mental strength up, it's up to me to continue working so that the coach trusts me,\" he told Telefoot. \"It's part of my history. I've always worked, I've never had things easy.\n\n\"I have to work harder, make an impression when he calls on me. It's up to me to give my all so that he trusts me.\"",

        "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to the Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not a typical goal scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create the space for them.”",

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won.

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

        "article_text": "Manchester City are ready to offer Erling Haaland a so-called 'mega' deal that would make him the highest paid player in Premier League history.\n\nThe 24-year-old striker, who has scored 105 goals in 114 games for City, including 16 this season, is currently in talks with the Premier League champions over a new big-money contract worth £500,000 per-week.\n\nThat's according to The Mirror, who suggest that his 'basic salary' would eclipse the Premier League's second-highest paid player, Kevin De Bruyne, who is currently on £400,000 per-week.\n\nHaaland has yet to put pen-to-paper as an 'issue' around his £150 million release clause continues to be a stumbling block, but there has been a positive response to recent negotiations.\n\nManchester City, meanwhile, are hoping that Pep Guardiola's decision to sign a one-year contract extension will help get Haaland's reported £100 million deal over the line.\n\nThat's according to The Sun, who suggest a contract extension would see Haaland remain at City for four or five more years, meaning he could potentially earn in the region of £100 million without bonuses.\n\nLast week, before Guardiola penned his contract extension, Haaland said: “I hope Pep signs a new contract. He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

        "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure. \"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

        "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. 'Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!' he wrote on Instagram. 'Thank you, Orlando.'\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n'“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,' Neville said.\n\n'He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n'This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n'They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.'\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: 'For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n'We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n'If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,' he said. 'Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.'\n\nHe added: 'Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.'\n\n'If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.'",

In fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'. With that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro. Porro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club. It is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him. The report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles. Speaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim. “He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid?

Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

        "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nHe also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\n“When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained.\n\n“Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added.\n\n“I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along.\n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days.\n\n“He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\nRoy Keane leaves The Overlap panel in stitches with comment to Jill Scott\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.",

        "article_text": "**Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.** An official statement from the BBC confirmed that Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour. Jenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'. And now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband. On Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband. According to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family. “My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy. “Now I just want to move forward. “Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.” Despite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future. \"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added. \"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future. “He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.” Jermaine Jenas and Ellie Penfold got married on 11 June 2011. When details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke with The Sun about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie. He said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault. “The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family. “There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.” “Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human. “When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n\"I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT.\"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\nGareth Southgate on England injury crisis\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

        "article_text": "Media in Uruguay have spoken out about Darwin Nunez after the Liverpool star was taken off early during the international match against Brazil.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil and Uruguay faced off in a qualifying match for the 2026 World Cup in Salvador, Brazil.\n\nThe match ended as a 1-1 draw with goals from Uruguayan Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde and Brazil's Gerson.\n\nLiverpool striker Nunez started the match for the visitors but was taken off over half-time, and now Uruguayan media have revealed exactly why.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, Uruguay manager Marcelo Bielsa decided to replace Nunez with Rodrigo Aguirre as he had been ineffective in the match up until the break.\n\nUruguayan media later confirmed that the substitution had been a tactical decision and that the 25-year-old had not suffered an injury early in the game.\n\nLocal outlet El Observador rated the striker's performance as a five out of ten, praising his defensive work while noting that he did not have a single shot on goal, in part due to a lack of service from his teammates.\n\nUruguayan newspaper El Pais also handed Nunez the same rating for his performance in the match, writing: \"Good work with his back to the goal. Precise in his first touches. He came off after 45 minutes of the first half.\"\n\nLiverpool fans will be happy to see that their man up front only played half of the match on Tuesday as it remains likely that he will start for their trip to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday.\n\nAfter traveling to Southampton, Liverpool will face a tough set of fixtures including back to back home matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nDarwin Nunez started both of Uruguay's matches over the international break.\n\nWith Diogo Jota still recovering from an injury sustained during the match with Chelsea, it is likely that Nunez will start, or at least feature, in all three of Liverpool's next matches. Speaking before the international break, Arne Slot confirmed when Jota is expected to return, saying: “We expect him back after the break. The first weeks after the break, I always say there is privacy about the injury. He will be back one or two weeks after the break.”",

        "article_text": "**Ruben Amorim has been told about a player in the Manchester United ranks who is \"impossible to ignore\" as he prepares to take charge of his first game.** After succeeding Erik ten Hag as the next head coach, Amorim has some big decisions to make in the coming months when it comes to team selection. Amad Diallo is set for a 'prominent' role under the new manager, according to journalist Dean Jones, who says Amorim is 'excited' by the winger's technical ability, work off the ball, and creativity in the final third. We will get more of an insight into his thinking on Sunday afternoon, when United travel to Portman Road to take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town. But ahead of the Premier League clash, Amorim has been urged to take a look at one of their academy prospects. Earlier this week, United under-21s maintained their unbeaten record in the National League Cup with a 4-0 win over Altrincham as highly-rated striker Ethan Ennis scored a hat-trick. Ennis, who joined the Reds from Liverpool in 2021, becoming the first player in 57 years to do so, has netted nine goals and two assists in 12 academy appearances this season. And the 19-year-old forward has been tipped to push for a spot in the first team by Steven Railston of the Manchester Evening News. \"So what you might be wondering, could Ennis be pushing to make his first-team debut? The answer is he should be,\" he said. \"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\" Ennis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. He could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",

And with Fernandes a self-proclaimed Sporting fan having played there before coming to Old Trafford, he will certainly be aware of his former side's star striker and his performances for both club and country.",

        "headline": "Bundesliga expert tips one of 'world's best players' to sign for Liverpool and tells fans to bet on it happening",
        "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. \n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool are close to ‘agreeing’ a transfer for a La Liga star as Arne Slot looks to bolster his squad in the January window.\n\nSlot has led his side to 15 wins out of 17 games since joining the club from Feyenoord following Jurgen Klopp’s departure.\n\nHe will no doubt be happy with his start as Liverpool’s manager - his team sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of Slot’s first challenges as manager was the lack of new faces in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool signed just two first-team players – Federico Chiesa and goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nThe club tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad centre-midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with the player favouring a stay in La Liga over a move to Merseyside.\n\nBut it is another player from the Spanish topflight who could be on their way to Anfield come January.\n\nAccording to reports by Football 365, Liverpool are ‘close’ to making Loic Bade their first signing during the window in the new year.\n\nBade, 24, currently plays as a centre-back for struggling Sevilla and has made nine La Liga appearances for the Andalusian outfit so far this term.\n\nThe France Under-21 international had a short loan spell in the Premier League with Nottingham Forest between 2022 and 2023 but failed to make a single competitive first-team appearance at the East Midlands club.\n\nBut since moving on, he has shown promise at Sevilla despite the club sitting in 13th place in Spain’s premier division.\n\nSomething that will no doubt bring a smile to Liverpool fans’ faces is the fact that Bade scored in Sevilla’s 3-0 Europa League quarter-final win over the Premier League club’s arch-rivals Man United in April 2023.\n\nThe defender, who stands at six feet three inches, cuts a calm, composed figure at the heart of defence but would likely play as back-up to Liverpool’s first-choice central defenders Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate if he were to sign a deal at the club.\n\nThe 24-year-old’s Sevilla contract is set to run until June 2029, but it is reported that Sevilla would ‘accept’ a fee of around €30m (£25m) according to Spanish outlet todofichajes.",

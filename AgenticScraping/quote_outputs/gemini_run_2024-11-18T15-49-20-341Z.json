Whereas when you are on the left wing, if you are late sometimes making the back post is a 20-30 yard sprint. If the striker pulls to the back and you've got to go across the front, then it's another 15 yards. I prefer the left, I feel like on the left it's easier to stay in the game. From even when I was younger I always wanted to stay in the game, that's why I think I struggle playing centre-forward sometimes because I struggle with patience. You might not touch the ball for twenty minutes and then your first touch might be an opportunity to score, you have to be mentally switched on and it's almost like being a goalkeeper. You might not be involved in the game for god knows how long but when it's time to make a save, they have to make it.

He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner.

Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher. I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time. But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.",

He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating. There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.

From even when I was younger I always wanted to stay in the game, that's why I think I struggle playing centre-forward sometimes because I struggle with patience. You might not touch the ball for twenty minutes and then your first touch might be an opportunity to score, you have to be mentally switched on and it's almost like being a goalkeeper. You might not be involved in the game for god knows how long but when it's time to make a save, they have to make it.

He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher. I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time. But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid.

He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.",

He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating. There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.

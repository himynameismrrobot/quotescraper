And this at a point in the campaign when fixture congestion is at its greatest.\n\nAmorim had two full training sessions with his entire squad before his first game at Ipswich on Sunday, and two more in the build-up to this European success.\n\nHe has already revealed his only way around the situation is to push those who do not start matches through full training sessions the day after. And Amorim is not sure how it will work.\n\n\"I get anxious because I don't know what will happen,\" he told TNT Sports. \"We don't control anything at the moment.\n\n\"I don't know the players and we have not worked a lot together.\n\n\"We go to the game excited, but at the same time you are nervous because you don't know how the game will go.”\n\nImage source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption,\n\nRuben Amorim received a standing ovation as he walked out before Manchester United's game against Bodo/Glimt - his first at Old Trafford\n\n*   [Man Utd recover to beat Bodo/Glimt for Amorim's first win](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c704de3gjkkt)\n    \n*   [What did you make of Amorim's first win as Man Utd boss?](https://modules.wearehearken.eu/bbc-sport/embed/12903/share)\n    \n\n'We controlled more, but we should kill the game'\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough the lengthy injury list that blighted Erik ten Hag's last weeks at Old Trafford is starting to ease, the lingering issues created by lengthy absences continue.\n\nIn his first game for 18 months, Tyrell Malacia lasted just 45 minutes in the left wing-back role that places huge physical demands on the player picked to fill it.\n\nLuke Shaw made a second substitute appearance, coming on for Lisandro Martinez, who was playing his first game since getting injured before this month's international break.\n\nAnd Mason Mount started his first game since August after being blighted by injuries since he joined United from Chelsea at the start of last season.\n\nIt was a relief for Amorim, therefore, that his team came out on top, having profited from Alejandro Garnacho's 48-second opener, then recovering - courtesy of Hojlund's double - after falling behind to two first-half goals in seven minutes.\n\n\"We improved different things since the last game,\" he said. \"We controlled more of the tempo, pushed the team a bit higher (up the pitch) and created more chances.”\n\nAmorim's complaint was that \"we should kill the game before the end\", as he lamented two wasted opportunities for Garnacho and another that substitute Marcus Rashford flashed across goal, all in the second half.\n\n\"I like the way the players tried to play our game,\" he added.\n\n\"Sometimes we won the ball and have had problems in the past giving the ball away too much - the mindset is keeping the ball.\n\n\"They are really trying and I think we deserved the win.\"\n\nHojlund 'did a great job' but 'has to improve'\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAmorim stresses his use of wing-backs is not revolutionary but there is no doubt his formation depends a lot on the performance of the man selected in the number nine role.\n\nWhoever it is, he is expected to keep the opposition defence occupied and protect the ball long enough for support to arrive.\n\nAmorim said after the Ipswich game that Marcus Rashford was not suited to the job. Hojlund's performance against Bodo/Glimt was more encouraging, even if his manager told TNT the Dane was \"dead\" through tiredness at the end.\n\nAddressing his overall display in the main press conference 20 minutes later, Amorim offered praise for the £72m signing from Atalanta, but also added a few demands.\n\n\"He has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball, but he is very important when we are in a low block because he is the guy who connects in the transitions,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"For the goals he was aggressive in the box. He is a quality player, scores the most difficult goals and did a great job today.\"\n\nThe games come thick and fast for Amorim - United’s longest gap between fixtures to the end of the year is four days.\n\nShould the club progress in the Carabao Cup, there will not be a bigger gap between games before the end of January.\n\nBut Amorim does give the impression he is enjoying himself, with United fans already creating a song for him and offering a warm reception on his way out of the tunnel and an enthusiastic one as he went back in and the game had been won.\n\n\"It was special because I came from Portugal and half of the stadium doesn’t know me,\" he said.\n\n\"I have done nothing for this club yet but the way they support me from the beginning made me feel I am not alone now, that I am one of them. I hope not to disappoint them.\"\n\nRelated topics\n--------------\n\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united)\n*   [Europa League](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/europa-league)\n*   [Football](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football)\n\nMore on this story\n------------------\n\n*   [Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united)\n    \n*   [Get Man Utd news notifications](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62294536)\n    ",

        "article_text": "Manchester United have met with Jorge Mendes about the potential signing of Sporting winger Geovany Quenda.\n\nMendes's Gestifute agency is negotiating on behalf of the 17-year-old Quenda's agent Igor Campedelli. United have been tracking Quenda since he made his debut for Sporting in August. A separate source says Mendes has bought half of Quenda's image rights.\n\nUnited have still not made a formal offer for Quenda but figures at Sporting expect the club to move for the Portugal international next year.\n\nMendes has a long-standing relationship with United dating back to Cristiano Ronaldo's first spell at the club in the 2000s. Mendes represented David de Gea for the majority of his 12 years at United, helped instigate Bruno Fernandes's transfer to United in 2020 and oversaw Ronaldo's return to the club in 2021.\n\nParis Saint-Germain have also expressed interest in Quenda. PSG have changed their recruitment strategy to focus on younger targets with potential to develop into superstars. Manchester City, Liverpool and RB Leipzig have also enquired about Quenda.\n\nMendes is scheduled to hold more meetings with clubs in the coming weeks to determine the most suitable move for Quenda, who now seems certain to leave Sporting next year.\n\nQuenda is under contract at Sporting until 2027 but he has come to prominence since the Manchester Evening News revealed United's interest earlier this month. He had a key role in Sporting's 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League three weeks ago and Quenda was named on the bench for Portugal's Nations League draw with Croatia last week.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 20 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka.\n\nQuenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Ruben Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.",

Those who did not appear against Bodo/Glimt will have full training sessions on Friday and Saturday but those who played the majority of the 90 minutes and are selected to start against Everton will have a gentler build-up.\n\n\"I was a football player. Football players: videos more than 12 minutes? Forget!\" Amorim laughed at the suggestion of video analysis. \"Because they lose the concentration.\n\n\"So, we have to work on... imagine there's an indoor stadium - we have that. Instead of video, we do it like walking and jogging, it’s a way to do it. Showing some video.\n\n\"Then we have all the staff. For example, Carlos (Fernandes) is with the strikers. They will show individual moments. So we will try to cope with that. Everybody has a job in the staff and they are maybe more important than me!\n\n\"Trying to see the game and what is missing. They are very good players, they need to believe and we will show individual stuff. Team stuff. And work. If you cannot run, you can jog and make the same exercise.\"\n\nAmorim indicated Luke Shaw, who made his first United appearance in more than nine months at Ipswich on Sunday before his second-half introduction against Bodo/Glimt, trained after the game on Thursday night as United carefully manage each player's workload.\n\n\"Without training we have to use the games,\" Amorim explained. \"I felt that we press a little bit higher tonight and all the time and Mason Mount did 60 minutes with high intensity. Rasmus (Hojlund) was dead in the end.\n\n\"The guys playing have to push more. Push the guys to the limit. And the other guys have to train tomorrow. Luke Shaw did some minutes and he's going to train now because we can do today some things tomorrow we cannot do and we will manage with all the staff how to cope with that.\"\n\nEverton's visit marks Amorim's first home game in charge in the Premier League against a side with two wins from 12 games this term. Everton have also failed to score in their last three matches.\n\nWhen asked what he expected, Amorim replied: \"A win. I am hoping to win., It’s going to be a different match with a lot of fighting, long balls, second balls. They have a quality coach (Sean Dyche) that understands the league, that understands the moment of the opponent.\n\n\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover. We need to rotate the team. I hope for a win and I hope to see different things and to see my team improve like we did from Ipswich to now (Bodo), with Everton, without training. But I expect to see different things and better things.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Ratcliffe has done a lot of good since becoming co-owner of Manchester United, but the mistakes are beginning to add up and his latest has lit a fire among supporters.\n\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have made the mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners, which has been described as a \"kick in the teeth.\"\n\nThe club have said the hike will only affect a small number of fans as 97 percent of tickets have already been sold, but the remainder and resold tickets will be subject to the increase.\n\nThe reality is supporters will be forced to walk away from attending games. One fan told the _Manchester Evening News_ the changes were \"gutting\" and another slammed it as a \"disgusting policy\", questioning how it has been deemed fair to charge children £66 to watch a game.\n\nUnited have not provided comment, although the hike has been privately described as a \"difficult decision\" and it's been said the \"increased revenue\" will support first-team investment.\n\nCarly Lyes is the chair of the MUFC Local Supporters' Club, an official branch for fans who live within a two-mile radius of Old Trafford, and she wants the club to perform a U-turn.\n\n\"Our aim is to try and build a sense of community among fans who live in the local area and to provide opportunities to young fans to be able to access games,\" Lyes told the MEN.\n\n\"It feels like an attack on the youngest and oldest, which are the two areas of the fanbase that should be protected and nurtured at all costs.\" \n\nRatcliffe's cost-cutting scheme began with charging staff to travel to Wembley in May. Mass redundancies followed, the popular European away ticket collections were scrapped and now fans will be asked to pay £66 to watch United.\n\nThe British billionaire has been given an inch and has taken a mile. Further changes seem inevitable and a protest against the ticket price increase is planned before Everton on Sunday.",

        "article_text": "Mason Mount made his first Man United start in 96 days against Bodo/Glimt and was warmly appreciated by his new head coach.\n\nRuben Amorim has reiterated his belief in Mason Mount and stressed the Manchester United midfielder must remain fit.\n\nMount made his first start in 96 days in the Europa League win against Bodo/Glimt and earned a bullish embrace from Amorim when he was substituted in the second half.\n\nUnited signed the 25-year-old for £55million rising to £60m from Chelsea in July 2023 but Mount has missed 41 out of a possible 72 matches due to several injuries.\n\nMount has only scored one goal for United but hit the crossbar against Bodo and the number seven has experience of operating in a 3-4-3 formation, having started as one of the two No.10s in Chelsea's Champions League final victory over Manchester City in 2021.\n\nAmorim said in midweek Marcus Rashford \"has to want it\" - a reference to performing consistently for United - and insisted Mount \"wants this really badly\".\n\n\"First thing is he is working really hard,\" Amorim said. \"And then you have to understand the human also. He wants this really badly. That is the most important thing. I think he has proven to all of you that he is a talented player. He was a European champion.\n\n\"So we believe a lot in him. He has to stay fit. And like all the guys in the team, they are quality players, they have to improve and believe in themselves.\n\n\"Today, he did a great job, and you see in some moments and details that you can see Mason Mount is a proper footballer. So we believe a lot in him, I especially believe a lot in Mason Mount.\"\n\nAmorim clarified United are also managing Diogo Dalot's workload. Dalot has only missed eight games through injury since he returned from a season-long loan with AC Milan in the summer of 2021 and the Portuguese started in 48 of United's 52 matches last term.\n\nDalot had started in every United game this season until he was rested against Bodo before he replaced left back Tyrell Malacia at half-time. Dalot, 25, has played regularly at left back this calendar year amid Malacia and Luke Shaw's absences and he lined up on the left wing in Amorim's first game in charge.\n\nHis compatriot believes Dalot is better on the right. \"He’s very powerful,\" Amorim said. \"We have to rotate him sometimes because he looks like he is always fresh but he’s not like that. He’s not a machine.\n\n\"I think he plays better on the right and we will manage to put him also on the right. He’s a very good player, very powerful and can play both sides. Nowadays, a player that can play both sides... it’s perfect, because you can put him in different positions.\n\n\"I expect the same (performance level) as you saw in the past year - a great player that can help the team and is really a team player. You can feel it in every play, the way he lives the game. So he's very important for us.\"",

        "article_headline": "LUCKHURST: Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do",
        "article_text": "Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nSpending big is a frequent demand from online football fans when quality matters more than quantity. Noussair Mazraoui is proof of that.\n\nDenis Irwin sat behind Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday night. The sight of Irwin, a world-class right-footed left back in his pomp and specialist at free kicks and penalties, will have made Manchester United supporters of a certain vintage wistful.\n\nNoussair Mazraoui, at 27, is already the same age Irwin was when United celebrated their breakthrough championship in 1993. Mazraoui almost certainly will never reach the heights Irwin did but flattering parallels are developing between the two full backs.\n\nMazraoui has started at right back, left back, the No.10 and now right centre back. He has not disgraced himself in any of the roles and has been the sole consistent performer in the early days of Ruben Amorim's reign.\n\nIt is telling that Mazraoui's two assists have come under two different managers and not the one who signed him. That fleet of foot that enabled Mazraoui to navigate his way into Bodo/Glimt territory was foretold by Erik ten Hag.\n\nOn the eve of Mazraoui's debut, Ten Hag said: \"It’s quite difficult to put him under pressure. Especially in English football, that can be very beneficial. There is always pressure on the ball. This is a player: one of his key attributes is it is very difficult to put him under pressure because he often finds solutions.\"\n\nSince a solid performance against Fulham, Mazraoui has maintained a respectably high performance level, as Irwin used to. Ruud van Nistelrooy and now Ruben Amorim have coaxed the attacking instincts out of him.\n\nMazraoui played his way out of trouble in his own third at Portman Road on Sunday and, when confronted by two Norwegians on Thursday night, glided past them like one of the nation's cross-country skiers. After Rasmus Hojlund adroitly finished with a touch-and-volley, Antony pointed appreciatively at Mazraoui.\n\nHis tactical acumen is worthy of an Ajax-schooled talent. Mazraoui shifted to right back when United were out of possession in the second half and he switched seamlessly back to centre half with the ball. His cross for Hojlund's equaliser came via anticipating and intercepting a pass. Watching it back, Mazraoui is hiding behind Antony when Patrick Berg plays the ball.\n\nBy modern United recruitment standards, Mazraoui is an outlier. A snip at £12.8million rising to £17.1m, he is a rare frugal buy. Tyrell Malacia, another Dutch-born full back and Ten Hag's first signing, cost marginally more but his purple patch extended to only three games. Mazraoui is well past the three-month mark.\n\nMoving for a right back Bayern Munich wanted rid of and whom West Ham United were on the brink of signing was not a compelling sell. Mazraoui started at Old Trafford last season and was hooked by Thomas Tuchel at half-time and a former high-ranking official was particularly sceptical of moving for Morocco internationals after their captivating run to the World Cup semi-finals two years ago.\n\nBut so far, so good. Wan-Bissaka arrowed in a rare goal in a rare West Ham win at Newcastle on Monday evening yet any United fan pining for him is either unfamiliar with the club's standards or brainwashed.\n\nCrucially for a United defender, Mazraoui has been available for all 20 matches this season. That is relatively remarkable when Mazraoui underwent what United described as \"a minor precautionary corrective procedure\" after experiencing heart palpitations last month.\n\nHarry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Victor Lindelof were all absent again against Bodo. United finished the game without a specialist centre back on the pitch as Amorim manages players' workloads.\n\nUnited have needed Mazraoui, with their crocked left backs only recalled to the matchday squad at the weekend. Malacia's first start in 550 days against Bodo/Glimt was too soon.\n\nMazraoui started 24 games last season and that has given him the edge over the fatigued Diogo Dalot. Dalot has only missed eight United games through injury since he returned from a season-long loan with AC Milan in the summer of 2021 and he has become a victim of his own fitness success. He lined up in 48 of United's 52 games in 2023-24 and Bodo/Glimt was the first time he was not in the starting XI this term.\n\nDalot played in a 3-4-3 system for Porto B as a teenager when United scouted him - in the back three and on the right wing. Mazraoui is seemingly just as capable and is likely to continue on the right of the defensive trident against Everton on Sunday.\n\nLike the unfussy Irwin, Mazraoui is becoming something of an unsung hero. He is seldom mentioned in press conferences and the most frenzied fanfare around him was when he left a restaurant in Spinningfields with De Ligt on their first night in Manchester. Professional autograph hunters had got wind of his whereabouts.\n\nInevitably, most of the pictures were of De Ligt as Mazraoui faded into the background. Irwin, such a low-key personality he extraordinarily did not protest his scandalous sending off at Anfield in 1999, would approve.",

He suffered a muscle injury towards the end of the game and has sat out the subsequent 10 United matches.\n\nThe 19-year-old has since returned to training and has made the matchday squad in both of Ruben Amorim’s first games in charge following November's international break, but is yet to get onto the field.\n\nMartinez, meanwhile, returned from a minor lower back issue that forced him to miss this month’s Argentina fixtures on Thursday. He lasted 60 minutes in United’s 3-2 Europa League win over Bodo/Glimt, Amorim's home debut.\n\nMartinez is expected to play against Everton on Sunday with Mainoo potentially getting his first minutes for nearly two months. However, both could yet still miss the clash with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium the subsequent Wednesday.\n\nThe pair currently sit on four Premier League yellow cards and one more will see them serve a one-match suspension. Should that come against Everton, they will miss the trip to Arsenal.\n\nThe threshold for such yellow-card bans only rises to 10 after a club’s 19th league fixture. Diogo Dalot and Harry Maguire - not yet back from the injury he himself picked up against Villa - will be mindful of the next seven Premier League matches, with both sitting on three cautions.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is handing out auditions for his Manchester United system and two players passed with flying colours - Tyrone Marshall - Manchester Evening News\nRuben Amorim claimed his first win as Man Utd head coach as his team came from behind to beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in the Europa League.\n\nFor a little over 20 minutes, Ruben Amorim's Old Trafford bow threatened to go horribly wrong. A head coach who always cuts an animated figure suddenly used every inch of his technical area, waving his arms in a mixture of frustration and urgency.\n\nThere was still a long way to go, but once again, the fastest of starts had been squandered. As Bodo/Glimt's 6,700 fans partied away to his right, Amorim fretted and fidgeted. Then, just as his side was starting to lose heart, they equalised out of nowhere.\n\nWhen Rasmus Hojlund's shot hit the back of the net on the stroke of half-time to draw United back level, Amorim turned to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand and punched the air. It was the most animated he has been after a goal so far and it felt like a crucial moment early in his tenure.\n\nUnited made the most of what is always a good time to score, claiming victory in the second half that propels them up the Europa League table and threatens to give them lift-off under their new head coach.\n\nAmorim had emerged from the tunnel just after his coaching staff, and his cream chinos made him easily identifiable to all of Old Trafford. A huge roar went up as he walked down the touchline, a greeting he reciprocated with a wave. He was all business.\n\nThe 39-year-old feels like the first United manager of the modern era. He is the youngest appointment since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and the first to fit the modern coaching philosophy.\n\nHe eschews the suit for a matchday, preferring to go with what he feels comfortable in. And he isn't back and forth to his bench. He spends all 90 minutes inside that technical area, pacing to the left, pacing back to the right, going down to his haunches for a pitch-side view, and rising back to his feet. Occasionally, he will grab the water bottle he leaves on the edge of his area and take a swig from it.\n\nAmorim wants his team to up their intensity levels, and if they need inspiration they only need to look at their head coach, who is living every kick on the touchline. His United team could be a lot of fun to watch, and he could be a lot of fun to watch as well.\n\nHe does try to control those emotions. When Alejandro Garnacho scored after 48 seconds, he simply picked up his bottle and took a drink. But Bodo/Glimt's rapid double briefly damaged the belief. So when Hojlund equalised just before half-time, it felt big.\n\nAmorim is having to balance instilling a new system into his players with the demand to get results, having taken over a team stuck in mid-table in the Premier League and the Europa League. He knows results will help the belief in his methods to grow, but also accepts there will be difficult moments. Those 22 minutes in which they trailed certainly fit into that category.\n\nBut gradually, Amorim's ideal team will take shape. He jettisoned six players from the side that drew with Ipswich as he looks to rotate while offering chances to all of his squad. There are still square pegs being forced into round holes, and it is a case of seeing who fits best.\n\nTwo of those who came in did their chances no harm. In fact, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund now look like they deserve slots in Amorim's 3-4-3.\n\nHojlund's first goal was superbly taken, controlling the ball in mid-air and then finishing in one movement. For the second he was in the perfect centre-forward position, holding off his man to convert a low cross into the box. It's the kind of position Amorim wants his No.9 to occupy and it feels telling that the centre-forward in his system has now scored in successive games from right in front of the goal.\n\nThat simple finish came from a patient passing move highlighting exactly what Amorim wants from his team. They were comfortable in possession and waited until the moment opened up before injecting pace into the play.\n\nMason Mount had his back to goal as he received the ball, but his backheel flick took two defenders out of the game and played Manuel Ugarte into space in the right-hand channel. It was an unusual position for a holding midfielder to take up, but it showed the fluidity in United's play. Ugarte's low cross was finished by Hojlund, yet so much of the goal was about Mount.\n\nHaving already discarded Marcus Rashford as a striker and moved Bruno Fernandes back into a deeper role, spaces are opening up in Amorim's team, and Mount and Hojlund passed their first auditions with flying colours. Both should start against Everton.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United supporters deliver clear Ruben Amorim verdict as Omar Berrada praised - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United supporters have been given their views on their side's Europa League win over Bodo/Glimt.\n\nRuben Amorim claimed his first win as Manchester United head coach against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night.\n\nUnited took an early lead in the Europa League tie, with Alejandro Garnacho scoring less than a minute into the game, following a great assist from Rasmus Hojlund. However, the Reds failed to maintain control of the match, allowing Bodo/Glimt to equalise through Hakon Evjen before they took the lead through Philip Zinckernagel.\n\nHowever, United drew level through Hojlund in first-half stoppage time before the Danish international scored the game's winning goal five minutes into the second-half. And below is a round-up of what Manchester Evening News readers had to say on the victory.\n\n**ALSO READ: ['Kick in the teeth' - Sir Jim Ratcliffe must make a U-turn after Manchester United price hike]**\n\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United wonderkid Chido Obi-Martin signs first professional contract]**\n\n**exLimey** beMount'slieves: \"Vast improvements seen, great goals, Hojlund got service, finally.

The second goal could possibly have been stopped had Martinez played a block tackle just as Malacia had lost the foot race forcing the Bodo attacker to turn inside to avoid the tackle - ultimately to buy an extra second for players getting back or Onana to set himself and for de Ligt or Mazroui to get across for a block - but I'd still say both are a problem of 3 at the back when you don't play at least one centre back out of position in the deepest DMF role to provide all out defensive cover in front of a back three.\"\n\n**MURED** added: \"I understand Hojlund scored twice, but my MOTM is Mazraoui.

I think Amorim is learning players, and players are learning a new system and as the game goes on, we will find out who fits or who needs to leave the club. Frankly, this was only the second game under Amorim, but I liked it way more than any other games under ETH. One thing I liked about this game was the rotation.

        "article_text": "Manchester United urged to upgrade £36m forward in pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres - Manchester Evening News\n\nUnited continue to be linked with a move for Viktor Gyokeres amid their goalscoring woes\n\nBy\n\nSean Sweeney\n\n*   15:00, 29 NOV 2024\n\nSince Joshua Zirkzee’s arrival at Manchester United last summer, questions have been asked of his form in front of goal.\n\nOnly manging to score one goal and provide two assists in 18 appearances this season, the Dutch international has struggled to reignite his form from Bologna that earned his place in United’s frontline.\n\nIn a recent interview with former United striker Louis Saha reflected on this as he expressed his worries about Zirkzee.\n\n“When you look at the performances of Joshua Zirkzee and when you look at the body language, you can see that this guy is searching for form,\" Saha said.\n\n“Not having a deadly striker is definitely still a problem. He’s a different boy than he was when he was in Bologna and that is a worry.”\n\nLast season, the Dutchman scored 12 goals and 7 assists in 37 appearances. He even managed to score more with Bayern Munich in just 17 senior appearances with four goals. The young centre-forward from Schiedam has struggled in front of goal in Manchester, and it’s already left United fans asking for someone better up front.\n\nAs such, Saha believes United should upgrade Zirkzee by signing Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres.\n\n“\\[United need\\] Someone who can create his own chances and also be able to score scrappy goals when the team is not playing well. Gyokeres could well be that man and he obviously has history with Amorim, but the price tag could be an issue.”\n\nGyokeres has been in explosive form as of late and has many top clubs circling for his signature including Arsenal and United. The Swede has played up front for Sporting 70 times now and in that time has scored 67 goals and provided 19 assists. In this season alone, the 26-year-old has 24 goals and four assists in 20 appearances, which includes a hat-trick against Manchester City under current United manager Ruben Amorim.\n\nGyokeres played under the management of Amorim since 2023 and has become a powerhouse of goals since. His services at any club across Europe would be invaluable, but if Amorim wants his star striker from Sporting to join him at Old Trafford, United may have to break the bank to do so. Gyokeres is currently tied to a contract with Sporting lasting until 2028 with a €100 million release clause.\n\nWhether United have the capabilities to sign such a hot talent or whether they need to are questions Saha has left to the manager.\n\n“It’s up to Amorim to find the link between United’s striker and the creative players,\" Saha concluded.\n\n\"And if they can’t, then he has to find the right players in the transfer market, where that’s Gyokeres or someone else. I think in a few weeks we will have good understanding of which way it goes.”\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.",

Rashford opened the scoring away against Ipswich Town with his first league goal for over two months, and then Hojlund contributed to all three at Old Trafford in the Europa League.\n\nHe dispossessed Bodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikita Haikin to allow Alejandro Garnacho to score. Hojlund then almost singlehandedly turned the game around on either side of half-time after the visitors took the lead.\n\nHowever, that feeling is seemingly not reciprocated for Joshua Zirkzee, with the outlet reporting that Amorim is actively trying to secure the summer signing a move away from United. After appearing as a substitute in the coach's first match at Ipswich, the Netherlands international notably did not feature in midweek, remaining unused despite being named on the bench.\n\nIt comes amid claims that Viktor Gyokeres' heart is set on signing for United to reunite with his former Sporting coach despite links to Arsenal and Chelsea. Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are also among those credited with an interest in the Sweden international.\n\nAmorim already ruled out returning to Lisbon for players during the winter transfer window but did not extend that to the summer. That is also when the coach suggested Gyokeres would likely leave the Portuguese champions rather than during January while still officially in charge of Sporting.",

The teenager, who turns 17 on Friday, netted an incredible 32 goals in 21 Under-18 games for Arsenal last season, but the Gunners could not tempt him to sign fresh terms, and United swooped in back in July.\n\nHis move was officially ratified in September after United had to wait for Premier League approval. Obi-Martin has already made an appearance for the Under-21s, featuring in October’s Premier League International Cup against PSV Eindhoven.\n\nHe was an unused in Tuesday’s Under-19s UEFA Youth League defeat to AZ Alkmaar. Other starlets such as Ethan Wheatley, Gabriel Biancheri and Jack Fletcher - son of Darren - did feature in that game.\n\nThe latter’s father outlined the type of demeanour his son and teammates must uphold if they want to break into the senior setup one day.\n\n“People talk about those who come through and their character and I think we develop it, but I think the people in the club always try to identify it as well,” Fletcher told Sky Sports.\n\n“So standards, timekeeping, manners, shaking hands, bringing in the kit after training.

The game evolves, people evolve but those things should be ingrained.”\n\nAmorim has outlined how he doesn’t need each of the academy teams to adopt his 3-4-3 tactics ahead of potential introductions into the senior side. \"When they are in the academy, they can play in different systems,” he said.\n\n“I think that helps them. They have to understand the game. It's not about understanding a system. They have to understand the game.\"\n\nFletcher himself underlined that it is important not to be overbearing with instructions during the early years. He takes delight in orchestrating a player’s journey from the youth ranks to the first-team, with 250 graduates making the step up across the club’s history.\n\nFletcher said: “Seeing them in the academy and working with them from a young age and knowing that they’re good enough to play in the first team, and then to watch their journey and how we carefully plot that and plan it, has been amazing.\n\n“It lifts the spirit of the club, the academy, fans. They [academy players] believe they are going to get that chance as well.

        "article_text": "Who is Godwill Kukonki? Man United wonderkid in line for Ruben Amorim's Ipswich Town squad - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have welcomed a new face to first-team training this week as Ruben Amorim gets a feel for the youngsters breaking through.\n\nBy Amie Wilson and Jack Flintham, Sport Central Audience Writer  \n\n*  12:46, 24 NOV 2024\n\nManchester United academy star Godwill Kukonki could be included in today's squad for Ipswich Town.\n\nManchester United have a reputation for believing in young talent - from the Busby Babes to the Class of '92, the Reds pride themselves on offering a path from the academy to the first team.\n\nIn recent years, that tradition has continued with Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho the latest faces to find a place in the United first team after rising through the ranks. Before the academy stars can burst onto the scene for the first team, they must first put in the work at Carrington and one of the latest players to make that jump into first-team training is Godwill Kukonki.\n\nIt is now being reported that the teenager is in line to be included in Ruben Amorim's first Manchester United squad. The Reds travel south to take on Ipswich on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick-off).\n\nThe 16-year-old is turning heads at Carrington, particularly with centre-back potentially becoming a problem position in the near future. At 6ft5, Kukonki is one of the tallest players in his age range and his imposing physique has earned him early comparisons to Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol.\n\nLike Gvardiol, despite being a centre-back by trade, Kukonki has been utilised in the left-back role for the U18s. His versatility, coupled with his natural ability to play with his left foot could also earmark him as an alternative to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, who United were interested in signing over the summer, seeing two bids rejected for the England international.\n\nThe Toffees are believed to want £80m for Branthwaite, which looks likely to be out of Ineos' price range so United developing their own impressive left-footed centre-back could be just what is needed. The youngster can also play at left-back which is proving to be a problem area for United, given the injuries to Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia.\n\nEnthusiasm for Kukonki's elevation into the first team may need to be tempered considering the centre-back has yet to make considerable appearances in the Premier League 2. He was recently an unused substitute against Newcastle United and has made a brief cameo off the bench in the National League Cup against Forest Green Rovers.\n\nHowever, his promotion into first-team training is another checkpoint ticked off in his development and this is unlikely to be the last we hear of the teenager.\n\n**Date of birth:** February 8, 2008.  \n**Position:** Centre-back and left-back.  \n**Nationality:** English.  \n**Career history:** Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Kukonki has become a regular starter for the U18s this season.",

It's not something special they should be lauded for. I think they'll compete but miss out. I think Tottenham have the edge over them.”\n\nOf course, a lot has happened since then with Ten Hag losing his job while Amorim arrived at Old Trafford and took charge of his first Premier League match in the 1-1 with Ipswich at Portman Road last Sunday.\n\nHowever, Carragher has now seemingly had a change of heart and has given his ‘updated’ prediction.\n\n“Now in fifth place \\[for Man United\\], this is the biggest mistake I’ve made in my predictions,” Carragher when speaking on [Sky Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcwLcl2Y6Fc) Premier League YouTube channel.\n\n“I put Manchester United in fifth position.

[You can read more about that here](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/corner-kicks-rule-arc-569609-20231122).\n\nAs you may have seen with VAR angles, even a vertical camera shot of the ball can appear to show that it is outside the arc, when in reality it isn't.\n\nBut there is another more practical reason as to why players position the ball in a certain place before taking a corner.\n\nSpeaking on commentary during [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea)'s [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) clash with [Crystal Palace](https://www.sportbible.com/crystal-palace) on Amazon Prime in December 2023, [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) legend Lee Dixon detailed the reason.\n\nThe former defender claimed that the white paint used to mark the 'arc' is actually hard, which means the ball sits in a slightly awkward position when fully placed on it.\n\nAs a result, it is easier to kick the ball with more accuracy when only a small amount of it is placed on the line, as is allowed within the laws of the game.\n\nIf the ball is placed outside of the arc and is spotted by an official after the corner is taken, then the set piece is retaken.\n\nThose laws also state that opposition players must remain at least 10 yards away from the arc until the ball is in play, meaning that the further forward the ball is played, the more the potential advantage for the attacking side if they are taking a short corner.",

After scoring 24 goals in 19 appearances across all competitions this season, Gyokeres has been touted for a big-money transfer.\n\nSo far, the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Barcelona have been linked, as well as Manchester United, who are the favourites to snap up Sweden's top talisman.\n\nIn fact, Gyokeres has already made up his mind on which club he wants to join in the future, according to **The Sun**, who suggest he has his heart set on a reunion with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim.\n\nThe 26-year-old certainly has plenty of options ahead of the January transfer window and his camp are considering options from across Europe.\n\nThat's according to a new report from **The Athletic**, who suggest there is an expectation that Gyokeres will leave Sporting at the end of the season, although a January move cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt is also claimed that the striker has a hefty €100 million [£83m] release clause in his contract at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, but Sporting are 'likely' to do business for around €70 million [£58m].\n\nGyokeres built a close bond with Amorim at the Portuguese club, which naturally puts United in contention if they are interested.\n\nBut that relationship is 'no guarantee' that he will favour a move to Old Trafford, according to the report, with the situation being deemed 'open' as the player and his camp consider their next move.\n\nBefore joining United, Amorim was asked about the prospect of reuniting with Gyokeres in Manchester.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" he replied. \"I cannot be funny with that in this moment. It was tough for me to leave, if I start joking about that with Gyokeres, I’ll have problems. This is my city, this is my country, I will respect.\"\n\nGyokeres is one of the most in-demand strikers in world football.\n\nAmorim added: \"Viktor has to stay until the end of the season and then his life is going, maybe, somewhere else.\"",

Improvement required everywhere you look but this is now a team with potential written all over it.\"\n\nHowever, fans were quick to disagree with the Ballon d'Or winner, pointing out the level of opposition that they faced in the match and the fact that they drew against Ipswich Town in the Premier League last weekend.\n\nReplying to the post, one fan wrote: \"Mate they just scraped past Bodo Glimt. Have a day off.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Let's get this straight. This daft punk just said United are good to watch again followed by IMPROVEMENT required everywhere you look Make It make sense.\"\n\nMichael Owen played for Manchester United for three years between 2009 and 2012.\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Far too soon, and it was average, plus always an initial bump in results when a new gaffer comes on board.\"\n\nAnd popular opticians Specsavers jokingly asked: \"Got a free half hour tomorrow?\"\n\nThe result takes United to 12th out of 36 teams in the Europa League as it marks just their second win in the competition having drawn all three of their opening fixtures.\n\nMeanwhile in the Premier League, United are also 12th in the table, having won, drawn and lost four games so far this season, leaving them with a total of 16 points.",

        "article_text": "**Manchester City and Newcastle United would be forced to change ownership if a proposal to ban state-controlled clubs is approved.**\n\nThe proposal, which has been put forward by Labour peer Lord Bassam of Brighton, has been submitted in an amendment to the Football Governance Bill that would introduce an independent regulator for the sport.\n\nIf the proposal is agreed by parliament, then [Manchester City](https://www.sportbible.com/man-city) and [Newcastle](https://www.sportbible.com/newcastle) would be forced to change their ownership in order to be granted a licence by the regulator, as per a report from [**The Times**](https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/lord-bassam-brighton-football-regulator-bill-state-ownership-rjzfmn9tr).\n\nBassam's amendment states: “No state-controlled club may be granted an operating licence, and any affected club must satisfy the IFR \\[independent football regulator\\] that they have divested themselves of their state-control before applying for an operating licence.”\n\nIt adds: “A state-controlled club is one which is wholly or majority-owned by individual(s), entities, or entities controlled by individual(s) who are deemed by the IFR or the secretary of state to be under the influence of any state actor, including but not limited to: members of any government or their immediate family, a head of state or their immediate family, diplomats, lobbyists, or other state representatives, or their immediate family, and sovereign wealth funds.”\n\nSo what are the chances of this happening? For it to become law, MPs in the House of Commons would have to back the amendment, which will only happen if the government agrees.\n\nThe likelihood of the amendment being agreed is 'small', according to the above report, but a number of [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) clubs have previously urged the government to introduce such a ban.\n\nAs per the [**UK Parliament**](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2024-0060/#:~:text=The%20Football%20Governance%20Bill%20%5BHL%5D%202024%E2%80%9325%20is%20a,League%20to%20the%20National%20League). website, the Football Governance Bill would establish an independent football regulator and introduce a licensing system for football clubs, particularly the top five tiers (from the Premier League to the National League), as part of a new regulatory regime for men’s football in [England](https://www.sportbible.com/england).\n\nThe bill defines its key purpose as 'protecting and promoting the sustainability of English football'.\n\nChanges proposed in the bill include strengthened ownership and directors’ tests, with sanctions available to deal with individuals deemed unsuitable, and restrictions on clubs operating teams in prohibited competitions or changing aspects of the club’s heritage without fan approval.\n\nThe changes have been proposed following concerns over the financial sustainability of football, which has resulted in the collapse or near-collapse of some clubs, as well as ownership models and possible breakaway leagues.\n\nThe English Football League and the Football Supporters’ Association have backed the proposals in the bill, while the Premier League expressed concerns about how it might impact investment and competitiveness.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim gives an eye-opening insight into the fitness of his Manchester United squad after they recorded a hard-fought 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt on Thursday.\n\nSince joining the club, Amorim has been vocal about wanting his players to improve their overall fitness.\n\nWhen asked if he will use a higher defensive line during an interview with Sky Sports recently, the 39-year-old began by saying: \"The first thing I think we have to be is better athletes.\"\n\nHe added: \"That is something that you can acknowledge when you are here and we see the data. When I say fitter it is not thinner or nothing about that. It is the data; you have to understand the data to press high. What is the average metres that you have to run. We like to run and to sprint.\n\n\"To press high you have to be very fit and you have to cope with the demands of pressing high.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, United came from behind to beat Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nAmorim made all five substitutions by midway through the second-half as Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount, Antony, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt were replaced.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports after the full-time whistle, he even said goalscorer Rasmus Hojlund was \"dead\" on his feet after playing the full 90 minutes.\n\n\"We had more chances [than against Ipswich] and were more dangerous. But we will have to change players,\" Amorim told TNT Sports. \"I felt that Rasmus was dead. Some [players] were really, really tired.\n\n\"We made four substitutions because of the fitness of the players, not because of what was best for the game. We are in that moment. We need the squad all together and fit.\"\n\nHere's how fans on social media reacted to Amorim's comments.\n\nOne wrote: \"How are those players so unfit ? Wtf did Ten Hag do with those players goddamn,\" while another commented: \"There is something rotten in the physical preparation of these players and this needs to be improved.\"\n\nA third said: \"It’s basically a mini-pre season he’s putting these players through. Everyone has to earn their spot. I wish he had more time with them in training but it is what it is. Baby steps.\"\n\nA fourth wrote: \"Amorim’s honesty is refreshing. It's clear he's pushing the players hard, but maintaining energy and focus will be key moving forward,\" and a fifth added: \"Exactly game management and player management to avoid work overload and nonsensical injuries.\"\n\nThoughts on United's fitness levels? Let us know in the comments.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim getting tired United players to walk through play patterns | Manchester United | The Guardian\n=============== \n\nRuben Amorim getting tired United players to walk through play patterns\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Manager uses videos to make up for lack of training\n*   ‘Rasmus Højlund was dead in the end against Bodø’\n\nRuben Amorim will compensate for a lack of coaching time by asking [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) players unable to participate in full training to walk and jog through patterns of play as he tries to fast-track their learning.\n\nWith the packed schedule meaning recovery between matches is required, Amorim explained how he would still coach. He secured his first United win on Thursday against Bodø/Glimt and the team host Everton on Sunday. United do not have a clear midweek in December and depending on how they fare in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Europa League may not have one before March’s international break, when Amorim would be without a sizeable chunk of his squad.\n\n“I was a football player,” Amorim said. “Videos more than 12 minutes? Forget it, because of concentration … Instead of video, we do it like walking and jogging – it’s a way to do it. And showing some videos.\n\n“Then we have all the staff. For example, Carlos \\[Fernandes\\] is with the strikers. They will \\[be\\] shown individual moments. So we will try to cope like this. Everyone has a job in the staff and they are more important than me, maybe. Try to \\[review\\] the game and what is missing \\[from our play\\]. They are very good players, they need to believe, and we will show individual stuff. Team stuff. And if you cannot run, you can jog.”\n\nAmorim used five replacements against Bodø/Glimt – Diogo Dalot, Casemiro, Marcus Rashford, Amad Diallo and Luke Shaw – before meeting an Everton team who have had a clear week to prepare.\n\n“We have to use subs to manage the fitness, not the game,” the head coach said. “We already know that it will be like that, so no excuse. We should be ready for Sunday and we have to win. We will rotate players and we will be ready. It is what it is.\n\n“We have to use the games \\[to become fitter\\]. I felt that we pressed a little bit higher \\[against Bodø/Glimt\\]. Mason Mount did 60 minutes with high intensity, \\[Rasmus\\] Højlund was dead in the end. The guys playing push more. Push the guys to the limit. And the other guys have to train. Luke Shaw did some minutes and will train now.”\n\nHøjlund scored twice to double his season tally to four and the No 9 feels comfortable in Amorim’s 3-4-3. “The new system, new ideas, are suiting my style of play. I’ve played this sort of football – I don’t say it is the same, but a 3-4-3. I used to play in Atalanta a little bit the same.”\n\nHøjlund played for the Italian club in the 2022-23 season, scoring 10 goals in 34 appearances. The Dane was asked what is different for him between Amorim’s system and that employed by Erik ten Hag.\n\n“The press is very different,” the 21-year-old said. “I have to focus a little bit more on what’s in front of me instead of behind. I showed last season with being the top scorer for the team that I can score goals. I’m still very young but obviously I would like to take the responsibility and that’s why I took the No 9 this year because I want to take the next level and the next step. But I still have a lot to grow – I’m still not the finished article.”\n\nHøjlund’s goal celebration featured a thumbs-up and thumb-down. “It’s the Gladiator one. We watched it when we were with the national team. And I thought it was a nice celebration.”",

        "article_headline": "Højlund sinks Bodø/Glimt to give Amorim first Manchester United win",
        "article_text": "Højlund sinks Bodø/Glimt to give Amorim first Manchester United win | Europa League | The Guardian\n=============== \n\nHøjlund sinks Bodø/Glimt to give Amorim first Manchester United win\n===================================================================\n\nRuben Amorim received a rapturous welcome from the Old Trafford faithful, then oversaw a helter-skelter victory in his first home game as Manchester United’s sixth No 1 of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.\n\nLike his five predecessors across 11 years, Amorim suffered. Under Europa League lights that shone down on the 6,714 partying Bodø/Glimt supporters, this was a standard welcome to the Theatre of Thrills and Spills as his new team just about made it through to the win.\n\nAs the contest closed André Onana rushed out of his area, slipped, passed the ball to the foe and United were lucky to escape. Seconds after, Alejandro Garnacho spurned a gilded chance to make it 4-2.\n\nThe passage neatly sums United up: both this evening and regarding Amorim’s challenge. Three points was a pleasing start before his own crowd but his tenure is sure to have copious bumps and bruises and who knows what else.\n\nWhat the 39-year-old seems, in these very early days, is a composed operator with a sparkle in the eye and an honesty his players will warm to. This all shone through when he spoke about his players.\n\n“I don’t know the players and we have not worked a lot together,” said Amorim. “We go to the game excited, but at the same time you are nervous because you don’t know how it will go. It was [a] special [reception] because half of the stadium doesn’t know me and I have done nothing for this club yet but the way they support me for the beginning, I felt I am not alone now, I am one of them. I hope not to disappoint them.”\n\nIn the feverish United soap opera how the new man’s 3-4-3 might fare is the latest hot subplot. At half-time the jury remained out, as Amorim’s side took the lead, conceded twice, then scored a fine Rasmus Højlund equaliser that had the No 9 juggling Noussair Mazraoui’s dink from right foot to the left, from which he dispatched a cool-eyed volley.\n\nHowever, what preceded this was the same United tale of being unable to hold an advantage and being too easy to knife through.\n\nBodø/Glimt arrived as Norway’s champions, held a players-coaching staff huddle by their bench, then conceded 46 seconds in. Antony’s opening contribution was to flop over on the right touchline yet while hapless the throw-in he conceded led to Garnacho’s opener.\n\nJostein Gundersen stroked possession to Nikita Haikin, the goalkeeper dawdled fatally, Højlund harried, fell over, headed the ball forward and the left wingman tapped into the empty goal.\n\nQuicker than Marcus Rashford’s finish at Ipswich (that took two minutes), could United assert control as they failed to on Sunday? No, was the answer.\n\nWhen Hakon Evjen and Philip Zinckernagel each scored they needed roughly half the time Omari Hutchinson took to register Ipswich’s leveller: by this metric Amorim’s United were going backwards – fast.\n\nEvjen’s bullet into the top-left corner derived from a hole through United’s middle. In came a pass, Sondre Brunstad Fet collected and teed up the No 26, who finished. Next Tyrell Malacia, in a first United appearance since May 2023, was left puffing as Zinckernagel chased a long ball and beat Onana.\n\nAt this juncture, United were as chaotic as throughout Erik ten Hag’s reign. So, when Højlund struck as the interval approached this was welcome.\n\nDiogo Dalot for Malacia was Amorim’s change for a second period featuring, first, Mason Mount crashing the ball off Bodø/Glimt’s frame. Better followed: slick one-touch football propelled Manuel Ugarte in on the right and his cross was finished by Højlund, in classic predator fashion.\n\nThe Dane appeared offside but United did not care. Amorim’s poker-face remained, as did a penchant for a technical area pace. United, who often defended in a four, should have pulled clear via Garnacho but he waited an age to pull the trigger.\n\nNow, a triple change from Amorim: Luke Shaw, Amad Diallo and Rashford entered for Lisandro Martínez, Antony and Mount. Then, a little later substitute number five was Casemiro for De Ligt.\n\nThe Brazilian took the Dutchman’s middle centre-back berth. The visitors were turned when Shaw found Højlund and the ball was sprayed right in a move that culminated in Diallo (twice) and Bruno Fernandes seeing efforts repelled.\n\nRashford, marauding, missed from an angle on the right. Amorim would be relieved at the final whistle if the lead remained. It did – barely – after Onana beat away a late Patrick Berg free-kick. United are up to 12th with nine points after five games.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n*   Europa League\n*   Manchester United\n*   Bodø/Glimt\n*   match reports",

Ten Hag was removed on 28 October, with his coaching staff René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar, Pieter Morel and Ruud van Nistelrooy all following. A total £10.4m was paid in compensation to do so.\n\nSigning Amorim, plus the coaching quintet of Carlos Fernandes, Jorge Vital, Adélio Cândido, Emanuel Ferro and Paulo Barreira who followed him from Sporting, was priced at £11m, the club’s latest accounts state.\n\nThe 39-year-old is United’s sixth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013. On Sunday, Amorim’s first game in charge ended as a 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town. On Thursday he leads United in his opening match at Old Trafford in the Europa League versus Bodø/Glimt. Amorim said: “It will be special, but it will be more special if we win. So that’s the goal, but it’s a special moment in my life, in our staff’s life, and I hope it will be the beginning of something very beautiful.”",

Thanks for joining!\n\n**Ruben Amorim comes over to speak to the Sky pundits**, including Roy Keane. He’s a very clear, direct talker. “It’s a tough league.\n\n“I think my players were thinking too much during the game. You can feel it.\n\n“It’s a tough match. We lost some balls without pressure and when you start a game like this, you score one goal, you have to control the ball, you have to control the tempo of the game. We cannot do it at the moment.\n\n“But they tried, they really, really tried. They want this.”\n\nOh, and Ed Sheeran interrupts the conversation to get pally with Jamie Redknapp. Just a normal day in the Barclays.\n\n**It wasn’t the most memorable game**, United’s most lively moment saved for the second minute. Amorim is calling his players together, getting them to go an applaud the visiting supporters. Ipswich could well have had the win, denied by some excellent saves from André Onana.\n\nNot the dream start for Ruben Amorim, but no disaster either.\n\n**90+4 min:** Muric holds on to Fernandes’ delivery. That should be that.\n\n**90+3 min:** Amad bursts into life on the right, driving into the box, launching his stepovers before cutting in for a shot that is blocked away. United win a corner.\n\n**90+1 min:** We have four minutes added on. Clarke hooks the ball from the centre circle to the right wing but sends it out, unable to cope with the pressure of the onrushing Mazraoui.\n\n**90 min:** Hutchinson’s cross from the right causes little damage.\n\n**88 min:** The home support bursts into noise, recognising one last push is required.\n\n**87 min:** The free-kick is played short and eventually sees the subs work together with Clarke finding Chaplin inside the area, his shot from around 10 yards not finding the power or precision to trouble Onana.\n\n**86 min:** Clarke is bundled down in midfield to win a free-kick from 30 yards or so. Mason Mount is on for Garnacho.\n\n**85 min:** It’s not really clicking for either side, genuine chances a rarity. Garnacho’s cross from the left fails to find Højlund.\n\n**81 min:** Liam Delap, after a very lively display, is off, as is Wes Burns. Conor Chaplin and Ali Al-Hamadi are on.\n\n**80 min:** Mazraoui is down on the ground to prompt a pause in the game.\n\n**79 min:** Fernandes lines it up, Amad next to him. The captain lets loose and is inches away … a dipping effort just wide of the post as Muric moved to his right.\n\n**78 min:** Fernandes wins United a free-kick by the D, opening up a decent chance …\n\n**75 min:** Muric cleans up at the back after Zirkzee wins the ball off Davis on United’s right. The keeper’s clearance meets the body of the linesman, who deals with the blow gracefully.\n\n**73 min:** Fernandes finds Garnacho on the left, the winger launching the stepovers before firing a cross in … there’s no red shirt on the end of it.\n\n**71 min:** Delap, again, somehow carves out space in the middle with a neat flick and sets off before launching a hit over the bar. He’s a good watch, feisty to go with obvious talent.\n\n![Image 4: Ipswich Town’s Omari Hutchinson celebrates after acoring an equaliser before half time at](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2777a887bf270391981b531d371e17456405bb9/0_909_3775_2265/master/3775.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\n![Image 5: Manchester United’s new head coach Ruben Amorim looks on from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca2d217d4539b4dd975ef1b8dcbecf5701b0088f/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)",

      "article_text": "Ipswich Town got their first Premier League win of the season before the international break while new Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is gearing up for his first game at the helm.\n\nThat sets up an intriguing battle at Portman Road on Sunday.\n\nBut, while they go head to head on the pitch, we have asked our fan writers for each club to go head to head off it.\n\nEach fan got to ask three questions of the other before the big game...\n\n**Steve Mellen**  \nFan writer\n\n_Here is what our Ipswich Town fan writer Steve Mellen had to say in response to questions from our Manchester United contributor Dale O'Donnell._\n\n**How important is Kieran McKenna to Ipswich Town?**\nHe is the key to the success of the past two seasons and getting him to sign a new deal was the most important event in our summer.\n\nWe get nervous every time a Premier League club sacks their manager. He is brilliant.\n\n**Ipswich's last league win over United came in 1994. Can the Tractor Boys ruin Ruben Amorim's first game in charge?**\nConfidence is high after the past two performances. I am slightly wary of calling a win, as you assume the United players will want to impress their new boss.\n\nI think as it is at Portman Road we can get a point, but we expect United to be up for it and to present a huge challenge.\n\n**Are you confident Ipswich will avoid relegation?**\nHopeful rather than confident.\n\nWe seem to be finding our feet, as the win at Spurs shows, but the odds are against us as a team that was in League One in recent memory.\n\nWe will fight to the end and will not be daunted by any challenge, and McKenna's ability to improve players and maintain team spirit will be key.\n\n_Steve Mellen is the former editor of ITFC magazine Meet Me At Sir Alf, and also represented fanzine Those Were The Days_\n\n**Dale O'Donnell**  \nFan writer\n\n_Here is what our Manchester United fan writer Dale O'Donnell had to say in response to questions from our Ipswich Town contributor Steve Mellen._\n\n**What are the expectations this season now Ruben Amorim is in post?**\nAmorim will be tasked with delivering on several fronts, but United fans are desperate to see an attractive playing style that showcases a sense of identity.\n\nWe did not know which United would show up from one week to another under Erik ten Hag, and he lost his job for not winning enough football matches.\n\n**What was the biggest issue for you under Ten Hag?**\nThe biggest issue in my eyes was how Ten Hag came from a successful Ajax side that played great football, and when he was unable to implement that system at United, he tried to make us a transitional team heavily reliant on the counter-attack.\n\nThe Dutchman may be a shrewd tactician but he watched his midfield regularly get overrun.\n\n**With Oasis reforming do you wish it was the early '90s again with Fergie at the helm and United churning out great teams from their own youth system?**\nNo, because I enjoy reminiscing about those times.\n\nThe Class of '92 is not something any other English club has been able to replicate and can only be compared to the Busby Babes of the 1950s and 1960s. Our academy still produces the best young players in the country, as seen with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nAs for Oasis, I hope their reformation means Manchester City go back to being rubbish.\n\n_Ipswich chairman and chief executive officer Mark Ashton has revealed that pop superstar Ed Sheeran helped Ipswich secure one of their summer signings on a Zoom call, just before performing on stage alongside Taylor Swift._\n\nThe 33-year-old lifelong Town fan has been sponsoring the men and women's team's shirts since 2021 and acquired a minority stake in the club in August.\n\nSpeaking about the impact the singer has on the club to Sky Sports News, Ashton said: \"A local man, global superstar, sponsor of the football club, now a shareholder and now officially part of our recruitment team,\"\n\n\"In the summer we were trying to persuade one particular player to join the football club and realised very quickly that he was an Ed Sheeran fan.\n\n\"Ed jumped on a Zoom call with him at the training ground just before he stepped on stage with Taylor Swift, hopefully that was a key part of getting the player across the line.\n\n\"We've gone from the third tier of English football to the Premier League, but we haven't forgotten our roots and Ed's a key part of that. The work that we do in our local communities is central to us.\"\n\nIpswich defender Ben Johnson spoke to BBC Radio Suffolk about his first few months as a Town player: \"I didn't realise how difficult it would be to settle in. I thought I would just come in and hit the ground running, but that's life if it doesn't happen like that.\n\n\"I feel like I've come in for the last few games and taken my opportunity. I've come in and the rhythm and form has picked up. I feel like I am fully settled now.\n\n\"It's just about wanting to come here and be committed to this club. I really see a vision and see great things from the players and the staff. It's something I want to be a part of, just giving my all and playing for the team is important to me.\"\n\n**On Sunday's game against Manchester United, Johnson added:** \"It's going to be a great game, probably one of the most televised games this season because it's massive when United come to town. Their new manager is very good and is going to implement a lot of great stuff.\n\n\"We're playing at Portman Road. It can be intimidating at times but it's a great stadium and we love to play there. It's going to be a great game regardless of what happens. It's always a great feeling when you play against the biggest clubs in the world.\n\nIpswich are the only side without a Premier League win at home this season (P5 D3 L2). Only five newly promoted sides have failed to win any of their opening six home matches of a campaign in the division, and all five went on to be relegated.\n\nThe Tractor Boys have had the fewest shots (108), shots on target (33), touches in the opposition's box (199) and expected goals (10.2) of any side in the 2024-25 Premier League.\n\nMeanwhile, Liam Delap has scored six of Town's 12 league goals this season, making him one of only three players to have scored at least half of his side's goals in the competition this term, alongside Erling Haaland and Nottingham Forest striker Chris Wood.\n\nIpswich Town legend George Burley says he is \"feeling well\" after his initial treatment for cancer. The former Scotland manager issued a statement through his former club in September to share the news of his diagnosis of an undisclosed form of the disease.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Suffolk, he said he had had chemotherapy and was awaiting details of the next stage of treatment, adding: \"It's one step at a time, but at the moment I’m feeling well.\"\n\nBurley said although it had been a \"difficult time\", he was trying to keep lively and fit as well as focusing on eating healthily. He had also been able to return to playing golf and had attended every Ipswich home game this season. The 68-year-old played for Ipswich from 1973 to 1985, making more than 500 appearances, before managing the side between 1994 and 2002 and was in charge the last time they were in the top flight.",

      "headline": "Concerns over suitability of new manager's style",
      "article_text": "As Manchester United supporters prepare to welcome a highly-rated and talented coach from outside of Europe's 'big five' leagues who has analysts swooning, they may be worried that it all sounds a bit familiar. But in Ruben Amorim, they can be certain that in one crucial aspect he won't be anything like Erik ten Hag. The defining complaint about the sacked Dutchman was that after two-and-a-bit seasons the football was still formless and the tactical direction indecipherable. Amorim, who will leave Portuguese champions Sporting to move to Old Trafford next month, is nothing if not a diligent - and decisive - tactical thinker. From a ruthless press to proactive possession football, from a daring high line to a complexly shape-shifting 3-4-3 formation, the hallmarks of Amorim's football will be etched into muscle memory in detailed training sessions. And there will be valid concerns. Most prominent will be how a Manchester United squad built in Ten Hag's image will cope with the change to a back three and a tactical system entirely at odds with what came before. It won't suit everyone. With United posting a £113m net loss for 2023-24, a £15m compensation bill for sacking Ten Hag and paying at least £9m to get Amorim out of Sporting, added to the £200m spent on summer transfers, the Portuguese is not likely to have much budget for January signings. Here's a look at the biggest winners and losers from Amorim's appointment. Amorim is, first and foremost, a flexible tactician. He will sit deep when required and push high when he can; will play neat possession football in some fixtures and tell his players to hit longer diagonals out to the wide men in others. Case in point: Sporting topped the charts in Portugal for both build-up attacks (126) and direct attacks (74) last season. But one thing that doesn't change is the 3-4-3 formation, which is rumoured to be a factor in why Liverpool favoured Arne Slot over Amorim when Jurgen Klopp left this summer. That means Manchester United will revert to a back three for the first time in a decade - since the early days of Louis van Gaal in 2014. Matthijs de Ligt, the marquee summer signing, is the most likely to struggle. He didn't look comfortable when Bayern Munich experimented with a back three under Julian Nagelsmann in 2022-23 and was dropped from van Gaal's Netherlands back three just one game into the 2022 World Cup. Harry Maguire is the only United player used to a back three, and inexperience here is a particular concern given that Amorim's aggressive high line leaves space out wide and in behind. The Premier League is increasingly defined by the sort of fast transitions that could expose this vulnerability, and we saw the downside of Amorim's approach when Manchester City tore through Sporting in a 2022 5-0 Champions League win in Lisbon. Then again, any downside from the switch may be countered by the basic defensive advantage of moving from a four to a five. After all, last season United conceded the second most shots of any team in Europe's 'big five' leagues (667), whereas Sporting, in a compact off-the-ball 5-4-1, conceded the fewest shots in the Primeira Liga (269). The wing-backs play a crucial attacking role in Amorim teams, stretching the play to allow the wingers to drift infield and get tight to the striker. United do not have any natural wing-backs in the squad but if Amorim is to convert a couple he will prioritise the players more comfortable attacking than defending. That's an accurate description of Diogo Dalot, who created 38 chances in the Premier League last season - the third most of any United player - and could be pushed forward. Not that the defensive side isn't important. Dalot has come under fire this season for difficulties defending the back post, notably losing Brennan Johnson for the opener in a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur and Crysencio Summerville in last weekend's 2-1 loss at West Ham. For an alternative, Amorim could go maverick, or delve into United's highly rated youth set-up. He has already converted Sporting's tricky 17-year-old winger Geovany Quenda into a wing-back this season. The man signed to close Ten Hag's infamous donut - the midfield hole that opens up when United's forwards press and defenders backtrack – has previously enjoyed success under Amorim. Ugarte made his name at Sporting, where in 2022-23 he topped the Portuguese charts for tackles and interceptions (179) as the chief destroyer in Amorim's double pivot. He can be the leader on the field; the man already embodying Amorim's tactics and inspiring others to match his intensity. Amorim's wingers, who sit just behind the striker to form a box-shape with the two central midfielders, tend to be direct runners capable of pressing hard and weaving their way through the lines in the transition. His wingers are expected to run at defenders, hence why Sporting top the Primeira Liga charts this season for progressive carries (262). In other words, Amorim prefers the polar opposite of the mercurial Fernandes, a traditional number 10 whose free roaming might not work in such a fine-tuned system. Alejandro Garnacho, on the other hand, could be the perfect fit. He loves to dribble through a crowd, completing 41 progressive carries this campaign, not far off double that of any other United player. Another possible beneficiary is Marcus Rashford, who loves to cut in off the left and run at defenders. In 2022-23, when he scored 30 goals in all competitions, the England forward attempted more dribbles (138) than any other Premier League player bar Bukayo Saka (147). However, Rashford would need to recapture those 2022-23 levels, with his progressive ball carry figures only at 16 this season. Viktor Gyokeres has been a revelation for Amorim, scoring 41 goals in 42 league games with a mixture of targeted runs, pressing intensity, and power in the penalty area; three attributes Ten Hag used to describe Rasmus Hojlund when he arrived at Old Trafford in August 2023. Amorim moved to a slightly more direct style of football after Gyokeres joined from Coventry City last summer, upping the verticality of his team to get it into the feet of his powerful frontman, so it's likely Hojlund will be deployed in a similar fashion. That adaptation is instructive. Amorim is more than willing to alter his tactical set-up to suit the strengths and limitations of his players, suggesting that even those players who don't look like an obvious fit could find a manager willing to bend for now... well apart from three at the back.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget to Erik ten Hag at Manchester United and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad as the club aim to end the damaging and costly cycle of mass overhauls.\n\nThe new United hierarchy have no plans under Amorim to rip up a squad they feel is capable of delivering far more and are determined to move away from a culture of persistent upheaval they believe to be financially unsustainable and destructive to coherent squad building.\n\nDenmark striker Rasmus Hojlund and England midfielder Mason Mount are cited as just two examples of players United are hoping can thrive in a new environment under the charismatic Portuguese, who will take charge of his first game as the club’s new head coach away to Ipswich Town on Sunday. Amorim took official charge of his first training session with United on Monday.\n\nUnited have averaged five new signings every summer for the past 10 years under four different managers with vastly different ideas of how they want to play. All have had little success to show for the huge expenditure.\n\nWhile Amorim is expected to be operating under a more modest transfer budget next summer than his predecessor Ten Hag did during his 2½-year reign, when he spent more than £600 million, United want to implement a more sustainable structure where waste is limited, the churn of players greatly reduced and more talent realised.\n\nUnited hope Amorim can inject new lease of life\n\nUnited feel there are plenty of players in the squad who, with better coaching, attention and support in the right system and set-up, have a much higher ceiling than they may have shown previously, and the club hope Amorim can unlock that potential.\n\nEqually, there is a feeling there may be more experienced players who also stand to benefit considerably from Amorim’s arrival and others who find they are given a new lease of life in potentially reimagined roles.\n\nWith losses before tax totalling £312.9 million over the past three seasons, United are under huge pressure to reduce costs to ensure continued compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and Uefa’s own financial sustainability regulations.\n\nThose pressures will become more acute if the club miss out on Champions League qualification for a second successive season and, with it, the vast broadcast revenues that come with playing in Europe’s premier club competition. In that scenario, United would also face a financial penalty under the terms of their kit deal with Adidas.\n\nUnited, who shed 250 staff jobs in the summer, are continuing to review costs across all areas of the club as they strive to reduce those losses. That includes the possibility of cutting in half the cash they give to the Manchester United Disabled Supporters’ Association, although there is no certainty at this stage that will happen.\n\nThe wider financial challenges will ensure a pressing need for United to sell well to raise money to reinvest next year and a sensible approach to buying after years of transfer-market failures and scattergun spending that have left little room for manoeuvre. Old Trafford sources insist it is imperative the club move away from the wasteful, inefficient transfer approach of the past and the cumulative damage of repeat mistakes by building a more sustainable model and structure.\n\nUnited are unlikely to be particularly active in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, players leave or injuries or other factors create a problem that has to be addressed.\n\nAmorim given time to assess his squad\n\nBut Dan Ashworth, the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, the technical director and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will give Amorim time to assess the squad and see how players adapt to his approach and methods before they start to make any definitive plans for next summer’s window and the type of players and areas they might want to target to supplement what is already there – in addition to who may go.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all out of contract next summer, as are Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo, although the club have options to extend both of those players’s deals by another 12 months.\n\nCasemiro and Tyrell Malacia enter the final 12 months of their contracts at the end of the season but with options for another year. Chelsea have an obligation to buy England winger Jadon Sancho, who is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge, next summer so long as the west-London club finish in the top 14 of the Premier League this season.\n\nAmorim takes over a United side who are 13th in the Premier League, albeit just four points off the top four, after the club’s poor start to the season under Ten Hag.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the Dutchman’s interim replacement, who has since left the club, helped to stabilise results during a four-game spell in charge, which included a 1-1 draw against Chelsea and 3-0 win over Leicester City in the league.\n\nAmorim spoke on Friday about playing “without fear” from day one and “winning time” and patience through victories and establishing a clear identity and idea that the fans can recognise and get behind.\n\nThe 39-year-old is expected to implement a change of system by adopting a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-3 formation, systems that brought him considerable success at Sporting.\n\nSeveral players whom Ten Hag was unable to call on this season are moving closer to first-team returns, including summer signing Leny Yoro and left-backs Luke Shaw and Malacia, while Amorim will soon hope to have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Maguire back after muscle injuries. There are fitness concerns, though, over Lisandro Martinez, who had to withdraw from the Argentina squad last week.",

Yoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night. Yoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left. Yoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26. United could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City. United full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now. Shaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era.\n\nAmorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford.\n\nAfter fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans.\n\nIf he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country.\n\nThe 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team.\n\nThe Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho.\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front-three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot.\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible. In his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte.\n\nBut in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.",

      "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United on February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

      "headline": "Manchester United can make stunning January transfer statement by hijacking Real Madrid plan",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is on the hunt for a left wing-back for his Man Utd system and the ideal player could be available for nothing next summer.\n\nRecruitment is done a little differently at Manchester United these days, but it does feel like the new structure put in place by Ineos has yet to truly make its mark on the club.\n\nThe initial £52m deal to sign teenager Leny Yoro from Lille was the stand-out transfer of the summer and a statement of intent from United, beating Real Madrid and Liverpool to the signing of one of the most highly-rated teenagers in European football. But the wheels had been greased for that move before United's new football department was fully installed.\n\nAfter that, the signings had a relatively familiar feel, with two former Ajax players and a Dutch forward. The decision to push for Manuel Ugarte, a holding midfielder who wasn't top of Erik ten Hag's wish list, was at least a sign of flexibility and things operating a little differently.\n\nTen Hag's sacking, and replacing him with Ruben Amorim as the first United boss to be referred to as head coach rather than manager, completes the organisational flow chat at Carrington. Sporting director Dan Ashworth now heads up the football department, with Amorim reporting to him. Technical director Jason Wilcox and interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell are also involved in transfers.\n\nThere will be a limit to what they can do, certainly in January and perhaps even heading into the 2025 summer window. An outlay of £600m in three summers under Ten Hag has depleted resources, and there is an expectation that Amorim will start to get the most out of the talent already in place.\n\nUnited have made a financial loss for five years in a row and continue to feel the pressure of financial fair play rules instigated by UEFA and the Premier League, so we can expect a tightening of the belt under Sir Jim Ratcliffe for a little while. The purse strings could be loosened if Amorim can deliver Champions League football for next season.\n\nThat makes hunting for bargains and deals vital. If Amorim's priority remains a left wing-back, then there is an option that could be snapped up as soon as New Year's Day.\n\nFor now, Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are the only options available in that area of the pitch. In training this week, Shaw has operated as a left-sided centre-back and Malacia as a wing-back, but both are returning from substantial injury layoffs. Amorim could be inventive and turn to Amad and Antony, but the feeling persists that he might look for a solution from outside in the long term.\n\nThat could be Alphonso Davies, with United credited with an interest in the 24-year-old as his contract at Bayern Munich ticks down. Davies' deal expires in the summer, and he has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid.\n\nDavies' agent recently insisted reports of a deal between his client and Real Madrid were \"not true\" and said he had options, including staying at Bayern. United can officially approach the Canadian international from January 1.\n\nThe fast, athletic, and attacking Davies certainly looks a good fit for Amorim's system, and it would make sense for United to at least consider an approach. If they can beat Real at their own game and secure him on a free transfer, then it really would be a statement of intent from the club's new football structure.",

      "article_text": "Sekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

There are just six weeks until the January transfer window reopens in the new year, which will give Amorim plenty of time to figure out whether he reinforcements will be needed.\n\nAfter spending more than £200million on transfers last summer, United could have a more restricted budget to operate with this time around. The club have also dished out around £35m in compensation.\n\nAround £10m was paid to Newcastle United for sporting director Dan Ashworth while around £17m will be handed out to Erik ten Hag in sacking pay-out.\n\nAhead of what could be a busy new year for the Reds nonetheless, the Manchester Evening News will keep you up to date with all the latest news and transfer gossip around United. A reunion between Amorim and his former player Viktor Gyokeres continues to do the rounds but whether that will happen, remains to be seen.\n\nWith that said, keep up to date with latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\nFormer Man United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen believes Marcus Rashford's career is on the line under Ruben Amorim.\n\nSpeaking to TribalFootball.com, he said:\"Ruben Amorim’s arrival is a pivotal moment in the Manchester United career of Marcus Rashford. The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n\nHis body language under Erik ten Hag was not of a player who enjoyed playing and those were not good signs, he needs to buy into the new system because if he doesn’t he will be moved on by Amorim. It’s up to both the player and the manager but predominantly Rashford, he’s on huge money but sometimes that isn’t enough motivation. When I was working at United, the big intrinsic motivation was one, to play for Manchester United and number two, to be successful at Manchester United. It was all about winning.\n\nIt's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. That is already a coping mechanism to deal with when things are not going that well. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to Le10 Sport, initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the Premier League when the January transfer window opens. It's claimed a loan move until the end of the season is United's preferred option.\n\nKolo Muani was previously on United's radar in 2023 prior to his move to PSG. The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nRuben Amorim has been warned that Manchester United could lose millions if he can't rejuvenate Marcus Rashford. The 27-year-old forward struggled to impress under Erik ten Hag but, with a new head coach in the dugout, he'll be hoping to turn over a new leaf.\n\nRashford, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2028, has featured 11 times in the Premier League this season, scoring one goal and providing one assist. Despite playing such a prominent role, he's disappointed, losing his place in the England squad.\n\nSpeaking to SportsKeeda, Paul Merson warned co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that United could have a 'big problem' on their hands if Amorim can't help Rashford return to his former self. The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nSo he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on. I don't know who buys him at the moment. It will be interesting to see how he performs under Amorim, certainly something to keep an eye on.\n\nInterest is growing in the Benfica star who could reportedly be allowed to leave in the new year, according to reports.\n\nCaught Offside meanwhile, suggest that the Portuguese giants are looking for a fee of around €60-70million. The Turkey international has previously worked under Liverpool boss Arne Slot at Feyenoord.\n\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nFormer Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does 'not think this squad is suited to three at the back', he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way.\n\nFabrizio Romano has revealed that Man United 'will continue' monitoring Alphonso Davies as the left-back position is a department the club have reportedly made a priority.\n\nReports in Spain claim United have 'launched an improved bid' to bring Barcelona centre-back Jules Kounde in January. The France international has been with the Spanish giants since 2022 and has 105 appearances to date. It's said Ruben Amorim sees him as a player who would be suited to play in the right wing-back slot.\n\nRuben Amorim takes charge of his first Manchester United game this weekend. \n\nSporting Lisbon assistant boss Tiago Teixeira has insisted star striker Viktor Gyokeres is 'very happy' in the Portuguese capital amid reports linking him with a move to Manchester United. Gyokeres, who joined Sporting for a fee of around £20million, has already played down reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee's agent has contacted Juventus over a potential January move amid the striker's unsettled start to life at United. Zirkzee only arrived from Bologna in the summer, being signed for £36.5m. He has struggled to adapt to English football, failing to score in his last 16 appearances since scoring on debut against Fulham.",

      "article_text": "Sporting Clube de Portugal star Ousmane Diomande has reportedly spoken to Ruben Amorim about the possibility of joining Manchester United. That's according to Sky in Switzerland who claim the 20-year-old is 'growing increasingly keen' on the potential prospect of reuniting with Amorim at Old Trafford. Diomande has quickly earned the reputation as one of the most promising young defenders in Portugal since joining Sporting in 2023.\n\nThe report also mentions he is set to be 'one of the attractions' for the next two transfer windows as United, Manchester City and Arsenal are claimed to be 'battling' for his signature. City, however, are thought to have had Diomande 'firmly' on their radar since his days at former club Midtjylland.\n\nIt's claimed the player is aware that continuing his development under Amorim 'would be beneficial' and is reportedly 'leaning towards' a move to United. Diomande is reported to have a £66million (€80m) release clause in his contract which expires in the summer of 2027.\n\nElsewhere, Real Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year. One of the clubs interested in his signature is Real with Football Espana stating the Spanish giants are 'favourites' and are 'confident' on securing his services from next summer onwards. Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, is expected to lose one of the two at the end of the season, though it's said it cannot be ruled out that both end up moving on.",

      "article_text": "A third of the way into the season and Manchester United are still in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nUnited have lost five of their 11 league fixtures but Ruud van Nistelrooy's uplifting four-match stint as caretaker manager has ensured new head coach Ruben Amorim will inherit a more buoyant squad.\n\nDespite United's 13th-place status, they have a League Cup quarter-final next month, have four games to secure automatic qualification for the Europa League round-of-16 and will start their defence of the FA Cup in January.\n\nAmad, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro regained form under Van Nistelrooy while Alejandro Garnacho tallied two more goals under the Dutchman. Here are how the United players have rated this season so far:\n\n**Andre Onana**\n\nOne of a handful of performers who has had a respectable season. Made some world-class saves (Crystal Palace and Fenerbahce) and important stops (Southampton and Porto). 7\n\n**Diogo Dalot**\n\nAfter a reasonable 2023-24, Dalot is in a rut. He has played often enough at left back to do better there yet he is underperforming on both sides. Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\n\nThe best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\n\nHad some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\n\nSeldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans**\n\nTen appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire**\n\nMissed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof**\n\nBelatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\n\nWeary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro**\n\nThe first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte**\n\nLeicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen**\n\nAlready started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes**\n\nFootball’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad**\n\nA decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\n\nUnited’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford**\n\nWhen he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\n\nNetted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n**Rasmus Hojlund**\n\nTwo goals in 11 appearances marks a startling start to his second season at the club. Unlike last term, Hojlund is struggling to get chances and his lack of presence is a problem. 4\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._",

The 25-year-old moved to France from Eintracht Frankfurt for £64.2m plus £12.2m in add-ons but has only managed to score 11 times in 52 games.\n\nThe France international has only started two times for PSG this season, despite Kylian Mbappe's exit in the summer. During the recent international break, Kolo Muani remained adamant at breaking into Luis Enrique's XI.\n\n\"You have to keep your mental strength up, it's up to me to continue working so that the coach trusts me,\" he told Telefoot. \"It's up to me to give my all so that he trusts me.\"",

Calciomercato previously linked the striker with a return to Italy and they have followed that up by insisting Zirkzee is unhappy at United and is 'seriously considering' leaving.\n\nThe report states that Zirkzee has instructed his agent to find him another move in the winter with Juventus a potential destination. Managed by Thiago Motta, who Zirkzee built up a great relationship with at Bologna, the Old Lady are said to be considering their options in attack should Dusan Vlahovic depart.\n\nA move away from Old Trafford for Zirkzee would add more fuel to the fire concerning Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting CP star is a man in-demand due to his terrific goalscoring record in Portugal, though a potential £63m move isn't expected to be possible until the summer.",

Gibson is the man who saved United.\n\nManchester United were once staring at extinction and were close to going bankrupt.\n\nCould you imagine if United did not exist? Well, that could have happened if not for the intervention of local hero James W. Gibson, who saved the club from the brink in 1931.\n\nUnited were in financial peril at the height of the depression but Salford-born businessman Gibson felt he needed to step up, so he paid £2,000 to rescue the club from collapsing.\n\nThere would be no United without Gibson. He saved the club, appointed Sir Matt Busby, created the academy and helped fund the rebuilding of Old Trafford after the Second World War. He was a remarkable man and it's important his legacy is taught to future generations of fans.\n\nAlan Embling, his great nephew, is the last living person to have known Gibson and he passionately spoke to the Manchester Evening News last week to discuss how he rescued United.\n\n\"Let's be honest, if it wasn't for John Henry Davies, the brewer, and James Gibson there would be no Manchester United now,\" he began. \"He rebuilt the club not once but twice. People forget that Old Trafford was a bomb site after the war and it all started when he attended a dinner.\n\n\"He was approached by a journalist who told him United were in a terrible state and nobody wanted to help them, so he said he would look at it and looked at the books.\n\n\"The finances were a total disaster, all the good players had been sold off and the supporters were leaving in droves, but he gave a cheque of £2,000 and it was a gift, no strings attached.\n\n\"They hadn't being paying the players' salaries for a long time and there was a huge backlog. It was just before Christmas and he covered the salaries up to January with the promise that he would see if he could help further, and he thought there was enough room in Manchester for two football clubs.\n\n\"He decided to help and he did. He became the chairman and part of the £2,000 was so the players could buy the biggest Turkeys they could get their hands on for Christmas.\n\n\"However, they were losing games and supporters were disappearing, so he held a meeting with fans and started to turn the club around. He rebuilt the club and it was incredible.\"\n\nOnce United had been rescued, Gibson appointed Scott Duncan as manager and he created an academy, with the intention of developing local young players for the first-team.\n\nGibson also improved transport links to the stadium. \"At that time, Old Trafford was quite a way out, it was isolated, so he negotiated with the railway authorities to stop passenger trains on matchdays so fans could use the trains to get to the games on matchdays,\" explained Embling.\n\n\"James Gibson always considered supporters, who were the most important thing to him. However, he was paying transfer fees from his own pocket the whole time, so what he did with Walter Crickmer was create MUJAC, which stood for Manchester United Junior Athletic Club.\n\n\"That was the foundation and the start of the youth policy, which was the first in the country, and the only thing he said was he wanted as much local youth as possible. He wanted to support them, he was very community minded and he wanted to do it for the local people.\n\n\"Gibson was a man of vision, he was ahead of his time. He'd been very lucky, he'd made a lot of money and was a hard working businessman, and the benefit of that was he was able to save Manchester United from extinction because the bank had closed on them.\n\n\"People had very little in their lives at that time and mostly going to the football after they worked hard all week was there only form of enjoyment. He gave that pleasure back to the people.\"\n\nUnited's former chairman and saviour, James W. Gibson.\n\nOnce United had been rescued, Gibson appointed Scott Duncan as manager and he created an academy, with the intention of developing local young players for the first-team.\n\nGibson also improved transport links to the stadium. \"At that time, Old Trafford was quite a way out, it was isolated, so he negotiated with the railway authorities to stop passenger trains on matchdays so fans could use the trains to get to the games on matchdays,\" explained Embling.\n\n\"James Gibson always considered supporters, who were the most important thing to him.

He wanted to support them, he was very community minded and he wanted to do it for the local people.\n\nGibson laid the foundations for the Busby Babes.\n\nGibson appointed Matt Busby as manager after the war and Mitten was excellent in the first few years of his tenure.\n\nEmbling continued: \"Unfortunately as I got older, I found out that a lot of people didn't know who James Gibson was and what he did has all been eroded away, which is wrong.\n\n\"What that man did was incredible. He didn't even cash from merchandising, sponsorship or the television and we've even found clothing coupons that he provided for the kits.\n\n\"The Gibsons were a dying breed. They were the people who looked after supporters, but when the big sponsorships came in, the big money men came in and fans were forgotten about. So much has been lost. United was like a family and you don't have that in the same these days.\n\nThere was a plaque on Sir Matt Busby Way commemorating Gibson's work as chairman between 1931 to 1951 and it was recently relocated to the players' tunnel inside Old Trafford.\n\n\"United should play more acknowledgment to two of the greatest men in the club history, James Gibson and John Davies, the brewer, because those two men were incredible,\" Embling said.\n\n\"Without them, there wouldn't be all those people enjoying football at Old Trafford now and I hope if they have to build a new stadium, something is done to keep the memorial.",

      "article_text": "The Ruben Amorim regime at Manchester United gets underway on Sunday and he already has some big decisions to make.\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is beginning to settle into his new surroundings and there are already a number of key decisions to make ahead of his Premier League bow against Ipswich Town.\n\nTaking over during an international can have its positives, such as an extended period to implement new ideas, and negatives - including a depleted squad due to international involvement. For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad, fresh off the back of a busy summer of spending, but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s.\n\nWith the excitement around Amorim's opening months in charge, a series of training pictures from sessions this week merely whet the appetite of the Old Trafford masses. There were sights of Mason Mount, Leny Yoro, Malacia, and the welcome return of Kobbie Mainoo - as well as an opportunity for several youngsters to brush shoulders with the first-team.\n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in their dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up, while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nThe United medical team will be keeping a close eye on the treatment table. In recent weeks, Yoro returned to first-team training but United will have to monitor his workload after the summer signing picked up an injury during pre-season and has yet to play a competitive minute.\n\nEqually with Luke Shaw, who stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks, after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer-term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.",

      "article_text": "Erik ten Hag was spotted back in Manchester on Monday. The former Manchester United manager dined in an Italian restaurant and cleared out possessions from a nearby home.\n\nTen Hag oversaw the worst start to a Premier League campaign in United's history and was sacked following a controversial 2-1 defeat to West Ham at the London Stadium. The Dutchman's dismissal was confirmed on October 28 and he immediately returned to the Netherlands to spend time with his family.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis and United moved swiftly to appoint Ruben Amorim from Sporting Lisbon as Ten Hag's successor. Ten Hag was pictured in Hale exactly three weeks after his United departure. He dined in his regular haunt Piccolino and visited his residence to clear out his possessions.\n\nTen Hag was joined by his wife Bianca and the couple left the restaurant as the Manchester snow began on Monday night. A few days after he was sacked, Ten Hag watched Heracles in the Eredivisie and he also made a return to Ajax to watch another game before the international break.\n\nUnited triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract in the summer after clinching glory in the FA Cup final and he received a multi-million pay out following his sacking. Although the 54-year-old's intentions after leaving United aren't clear, there is expected to be interest in Ten Hag from European clubs and he is expected to return to management.\n\nTen Hag was spotted in Manchester on the same day as Amorim's first training session at Carrington. The 39-year-old was forced to wait until his visa was approved to coach on grass - he was allowed to hold meetings with staff - and took a session with nine senior players.\n\nAmorim's first game in charge of United will come against Ipswich Town this weekend and he must move United into the top half of the table, as they are currently 13th in the league.\n\nAfter Ten Hag's exit, the Dutchman wrote an emotional letter to United fans and said: \"Dear fans, Let me start by thanking you. Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable.\n\n\"The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents' stadiums, whether the game was in England, Europe or during the summer tours.\n\n\"I always enjoyed meeting Manchester United fans throughout the world. Walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in England, Europe, Asia, Australia, the USA - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity. That's what makes United supporters so special.\n\n\"I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also want to thank the staff in every department of the club for their unwavering support in good times and bad.\n\n\"We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end.\n\n\"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.\"",

      "article_text": "Manchester United youngster Jim Thwaites took part in first-team training on Monday, despite being aged just 16 years old.\n\nThere are multiple senior players who are still away on international duty, meaning youngsters were needed to make up the numbers in Ruben Amorim's first training session.\n\nAmong the academy players to be called up was Thwaites, who was also given the opportunity to train with the first-team by Erik ten Hag ahead of facing Brighton in August.\n\nThwaites is considered as one of the academy's leading prospects in his age group and won the club's Goal of the Season award for both Under-16 and Under-18 level last term. The youngster's great form has continued into this campaign and he recently scored a stunning free-kick.\n\nThwaites has contributed four goals and two assists in just three starts - he has made a total of nine appearances - for the U18s and has spent some time with the U16 group.\n\nThe midfielder predominantly played for the U16s last season, but he made nine appearances for the U18s and was given two substitute appearances for the Under-21s.\n\nHe was expected to be given a prominent role in Adam Lawrence's U18 side this season and he's gone from strength to strength, making an appearance in every U18 league game.\n\nDifferent sources have suggested Thwaites has slightly gone under the radar in the conversation about emerging prospects and the youngster has been tipped to have a bright future.\n\nThwaites was the second 16-year-old to be involved in Amorim's first training session, as imposing defender Godwill Kukonki also took part, which was a huge milestone in his career.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim might be about to change Bruno Fernandes' Manchester United plan",
      "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes is likely to play a key part in Ruben Amorim's thinking at Man United - but his role could be a lot different to what he had previously envisioned.\n\nSuspended for Portugal's final game of their UEFA Nations League campaign on Monday night, Ruben Amorim must have welcomed Roberto Martinez's decision to release Bruno Fernandes from international duty early.\n\nThe Manchester United captain earned his second yellow card of the campaign in Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland on Friday night as they secured their position at the top of Group A1 with a game to spare, ruling him out of the trip to Croatia. As a result of clinching top spot, Portugal boss Martinez made the decision to release a handful of players from his squad early, no doubt to the delight of their respective clubs.\n\nMartinez's decision has means Fernandes is set for more time on the training ground ahead of Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town. The trip to Portman Road will mark the beginning of a new era at United, with new head coach Amorim taking charge for the very first time.\n\nThe recent arrival of the 39-year-old has given everyone associated with United a much-needed lift, not least the supporters, who are eager to see how the former Sporting Lisbon boss will take the club forward. Although Amorim refused to get bogged down in the topic of formations during his first interview as United boss, the expectation is that he will unleash a new-look 3-4-3 system from the off. It was the bedrock of much of his success at Sporting.\n\nThe prospect of United starting with a brand-new shape at Portman Road is attracting plenty of intrigue ahead of Amorim's debut in the dugout. Under Erik ten Hag, United very rarely lined up in anything other than a 4-3-3.\n\nThe switch to a system featuring wing-backs means Fernandes is expected to be dragged out of midfield and operate in the front-three. The general expectation is that he will start in an inverted wide role. The prospect of Amorim making that decision will represent a complete contrast to the role Fernandes envisions making his own in years to come. So often reliable wherever he plays, Fernandes earlier this year admitted that he expects to become a No.6 as his career continues to evolve.\n\n\"I have played, however, especially last season with coach Ten Hag, deeper,\" said Fernandes, speaking in March. \"In fact, against Everton, I played No.6 and I still think it was one of the most complete games I've played, at all levels.\n\n\"In terms of passing, game organisation, defence, tactics. I have a little thought in my head that I'm going to end my career further back, because everyone who started there and went to No.10 ended up retreating on the field at the end.\n\n\"It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.\n\n\"The game with Everton was the one in which I created the most scoring opportunities, even though I was playing deeper and not playing as a No.10.\"\n\nRegarded as United's most creative midfielder, there is little chance of Fernandes occupying one of the two natural midfield roles in Amorim's preferred formation. They are likely to be reserved by Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo, who are more defensively astute than Fernandes.\n\nFernandes never shirked away from the challenge of occasionally being deployed out wide under Ten Hag, often excelling because of his versatility and excellent tactical awareness. With United's width under Amorim expected to be supplied by the wing-backs, Fernandes' 'wide role' could actually be very subtle.",

A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.\n\nBlanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday.",

      "headline": "Scoring 100 goals a season and sharing a Roy Keane trait - Dan Gore's United journey",
      "article_text": "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.\n\nGore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.\n\n“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"\n\nGore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.\n\nHe trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.\n\nAlthough Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.\n\n\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.\n\n\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.\n\n\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.\n\n\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f***ing horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"\n\nGore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.\n\n\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.\n\n\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.\n\n\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\n\nMike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.\n\n\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.\n\n\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.\n\n\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.\n\n\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"\n\nHargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.\n\n\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.\n\n\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"\n\nThe burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.\n\n\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.\n\n\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.\n\n\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\n\nGore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.\n\n\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.\n\n\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"\n\nHargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.\n\n\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.\n\n\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\n\nGore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.\n\n\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.\n\n\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"\n\nHargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\n\nGore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim can unleash a Manchester United partnership Erik ten Hag only used once vs Ipswich",
      "article_text": "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim has been given a much-needed boost ahead of his first game in charge on Sunday.\nThe sight of Kobbie Mainoo back on the grass at the Carrington earlier this week was exactly what Manchester United's supporters wanted to see ahead of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge this weekend.\nThe academy graduate has been missing for more than a month through injury, last featuring in United's 0-0 draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park on October 6.\nMissing the last seven matches, the prospect of Mainoo being in contention for Amorim's debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon will be a welcome boost for the new Reds head coach.\nNext Tuesday will mark exactly a year to the day since Mainoo made his full Premier League debut for United, starring in their 3-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park. Deployed at the base of the midfield that afternoon, he produced an outstanding display.\nFrom that moment onwards, Mainoo became a staple in United's midfield, starting 23 of the their remaining 25 Premier League matches last season. He had gone from being a promising academy product to a first-team undroppable in the blink of an eye.\nAlthough Mainoo made his mark against Everton as a holding midfielder, it soon became apparent he was more comfortable getting on the ball and advancing. He is a forward-thinking player, capable of receiving the ball and looking to attack.\nAmid Casemiro's downfall last season, United went into the summer transfer window knowing they had to recruit a world-class defensive-midfielder to sit alongside Mainoo in the engine room. After several months of speculation, Manuel Ugarte joined the club from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day.\n\"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer,\" said sporting director Dan Ashworth. \"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level. His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"\nManuel Ugarte signed for Manchester United in August.\nSigning a player of Ugarte's profile was exactly what both United and Mainoo needed. The Uruguayan was expected to slot straight into United's first-choice midfield and become Mainoo's perfect partner.\nHowever, former United manager Erik ten Hag, who had made Ugarte his third-choice midfield signing during the summer, was not forthcoming when it came to giving the former Sporting Lisbon man an opportunity to make an early mark at Old Trafford. He featured just seven times under the Dutchman, making four starts.\nOf those four starts, it was only on one of them that he lined up alongside Mainoo in midfield. They both started the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 29, but Mainoo was substituted just before half-time with United both 1-0 down and a man down, following the sending off of Bruno Fernandes.\nIt was a forgettable afternoon, meaning it was hard to assess just how Ugarte and Mainoo could work in tandem.\nSince their last and only start together, a lot has changed at Old Trafford, of course. Ten Hag has been sacked and replaced by Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has spent several weeks out injured and Ugarte has earned more minutes as a starter.\nThe 23-year-old worked with Amorim at Sporting prior to his move to PSG in July 2023 and has made more appearances under the new United boss than any other coach during his senior career, meaning he is highly likely to become an important figure in his plans at United.\nUgarte, under former United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, formed a strong bond with Casemiro in midfield, but Mainoo's recent return to training means he could soon replace the Brazilian in the starting XI, forming Amorim's first-choice midfield next to Ugarte.\nOn paper, a midfield partnership of Ugarte and Mainoo offers a blend of defensive nous, ball retention and the opportunity to progress the ball. It is the midfield duo many United supporters anticipated becoming the club's first-choice partnership after Ugarte's August arrival.\nThe likelihood of Amorim installing a 3-4-3 formation means Fernandes, who previously operated as the most advanced midfielder in Ten Hag's preferred 4-3-3, is expected to be forced further forward, leaving two midfield spots up for grabs. Ugarte is expected to bag one of them and Mainoo should claim the other once he is back up to full fitness, whether that be this weekend or a little further down the line. At the ages of 23 and 19, respectively, they should form United's midfield for the future.",

The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who comes with a high reputation, has repeatedly urged his players to increase their pace throughout the week as he aims to make an immediate impact, with reports stating he has been taken aback by the lack of speed and intensity in training sessions.\n\nAmorim plans to quickly implement his 3-4-3 system and it's understood that he already knows certain players won't be able to adapt to it, reports The Sun. His coaching staff and analysts are working hard to get the players up to speed with Amorim's set-up.\n\nThe 39-year-old's first game in charge will be against Ipswich Town on Sunday, where United are expected to showcase a new look under Amorim's guidance. Despite being surprised by certain aspects of training and some players, Amorim has also been impressed by the quality of others.\n\nDespite currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League following their worst ever start to a season, Amorim believes this does not accurately reflect where the team should be.\n\nDespite the significant investment in the squad, United are still not ready to compete for the title. Amorim has reportedly been forthright in his critique of the team's performance, which he believes has been subpar for over a decade.\n\nHe has apparently told his players that they have been \"living in Sir Alex Ferguson's shadow\", unable to emulate his success. The last Premier League title was won under Ferguson in 2013, and Amorim feels that the team has failed to harness his spirit as a motivating force.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"He told them that top managers have not replicated Sir Alex's success because they have lived in his shadow, rather than getting their team to play with his spirit.\"",

      "headline": "Manchester United target Viktor Gyokeres teases transfer in Ruben Amorim message",
      "article_text": "Viktor Gyokeres has hinted at a potential exit from Sporting Clube de Portugal at the end of this season. The Swedish striker has become one of Europe's most coveted talents following his stellar performances with the Portuguese champions, netting 23 club goals in just 16 matches this season. Despite having a £83.5million (€100m) release clause in his contract, it is believed that Sporting president Frederico Varandas would entertain offers around £66m (€80m), provided Gyokeres remains with Sporting until the season concludes. This development is likely to pique the interest of some of Europe's top clubs and could spark a fierce battle for his signature next summer. Following Manchester United's recent appointment of Gyokeres' former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, they are considered one of the favourites to secure Gyokeres. Amorim and Gyokeres shared a strong bond during their time together in Lisbon. Given United's current struggles for goals in the Premier League this season, they are in desperate need of a world-class finisher. Amorim, who will spend his initial six months at United assessing the squad, was informed when he left the Portuguese club last week that he wouldn't be permitted to approach them in the January transfer window and would have to wait until the summer. Amorim will also benefit from the substantial financial backing of United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Gyokeres was asked about a potential move. He said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course I want to finish the season at Sporting, I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future.\" The prolific Sweden international then teased that a move away from Sporting could happen, adding: \"We'll see when the time comes.\" When commenting on Amorim's switch to United, Gyokeres did not hide his emotions, stating: \"It's very sad that he left, but of course we understand the decision.\"",

      "headline": "I made my Man United Premier League debut with Marcus Rashford - but now I've already retired",
      "article_text": "Marcus Rashford made his Manchester United debut against Arsenal in February 2016, but he wasn't the only academy graduate to make his Premier League bow that day. \n\nMarcus Rashford's Premier League debut is a well-known tale - it occurred just three days after his first-ever senior appearance for the club. However, less known is the story of another academy graduate who also made his debut that day.\n\nWhile Louis van Gaal gave a second chance to a young Rashford, who had just turned out in a Europa League tie against FC Midtjylland 72 hours earlier, James Weir was dealing with his own nerves. Manchester United were leading Arsenal 3-2, thanks to two goals from Rashford - making it four in less than 150 senior minutes for the club - when Van Gaal looked to his bench.\n\nDespite having other options, Van Gaal chose midfielder Weir. Ander Herrera, on a yellow card and having scored, was replaced by Weir, marking his first and only appearance for the first team.\n\nHis time with the Red Devils didn't last much longer, as he left for Hull just six months later, where he struggled with injuries and saw little playtime.\n\nDespite captaining the Under-21s side at Carrington to a league victory, he never got another shot at top-tier football, missing Hull's entire season before their relegation. Aged just 28, he retired after stints at Wigan and Bolton, as well as overseas with MTK Budapest, FC ViOn, and Pohronie.\n\nWeir still recalls the season he was involved in senior action at United. \"I was on the bench for about 10 games,\" he shared with the Guardian.\n\n\"It was a bit of a whirlwind – it feels like a lifetime ago.\n\n\"My debut was an out‐of-body experience but they were the best moments of my career. Being in the squad and exposed to a club that size was incredible. I wouldn't change that minute for anything.\"\n\nIn a previous chat with Planet Football, he elaborated on his brief appearance. \"Usually, you start warming up after 25 minutes or go for a little run to get the manager's attention, but it was different with Van Gaal,\" he explained.\n\n\"You had to wait until he told you to warm up, which meant he was then likely to send you on. After about 75 or 80 minutes he told me to warm up and then someone shouted down the touchline to me to come back to the technical area. I was thinking, 'Bloody hell, I am going to come on here'.\n\nReflecting on his fleeting but memorable appearance in the Premier League for Manchester United, the player expressed a mix of pride and humour, saying: \"I can tell my children and grandchildren that I played for Manchester United in the Premier League – although I may not mention the one-minute bit!\" \n\nIn an interview with the Manchester Evening News, he went on to describe the intensity of the moment: \"At the time you're thinking 'don't mess up', it was 3-2, I was just thinking 'run around and do what you can' and then it was over.\n\n\"I came on for Herrera and he came up to me and said 'fight! ' It was typical of him. I remember that clearly. In terms of the coaches, I think it was more just 'don't mess up'.\n\n\"Ander was a good guy. He was all emotion and passion, there was no holding back.\"\n\nThe surreal atmosphere during manager Louis van Gaal's theatrics was not lost on him either, as he recounted: \"It was a crazy day, Van Gaal did that impression of Alexis Sanchez on the touchline when he fell to the ground. I was warming up at the time, I thought a fight was going on or something, I only saw it afterwards.\n\nOn the subject of fellow Red Marcus Rashford, he shared his personal connections and the striker's meteoric rise: \"For Marcus to score twice was surreal really. It made the day even more special. I was a bit older than him, but we were in the same digs together for a couple of years. We used to play FIFA together and go out for food, but I didn't play with him too much as I was a bit older than him. \n\nWhen he got to the reserves we had a couple of games, but he was straight through to the first team really. He missed that period because we had no strikers at the time, he went on to take his chance and the rest is history. We all knew he was the top one in his age group and that he was always destined to reach pretty good heights.\n\nHowever, Weir has now chosen to hang up his boots and start a new career as a travel agent. In an interview with The Guardian, he explained: \"I can still play football at some level but playing at a professional level day in and day out, my body didn't have that. It was not worth the sacrifice of living away anymore. I thought I needed to cut the cord early and move on to something else.",

      "article_text": "Sporting Lisbon assistant boss Tiago Teixeira has insisted star striker Viktor Gyokeres is 'very happy' in the Portuguese capital amid reports linking him with a move to Manchester United.\n\nThe 26-year-old is currently the most sought after striker in Europe after making an explosive start to the season for club and country. His four-goal haul for Sweden against Azerbaijan in the UEFA Nations League on Tuesday night increased his tally of goals this season to 32.\n\nGyokeres joined Sporting from Coventry City in July 2023 and instantly blossomed under now-United head coach Ruben Amorim. He scored 66 goals in 68 matches under the 39-year-old's stewardship.\n\nEver since Amorim swapped Lisbon for Manchester earlier this month, reports connecting Gyokeres with a reunion with his former boss have soared. Many believe United would benefit from signing a striker of the Swede's profile. However, Teixeira, who is tasked with supporting Amorim's successor at Sporting, Joao Pereira, is adamant Gyokeres is not in any hurry to leave the Portuguese club.\n\nTeixeira, speaking to the Portuguese media, said: \"We are prepared to welcome him today to train for the first time [since being away on international duty] and we are very happy to have him here.\n\n\"He is also very happy with the season he is having representing Sporting and his national team. He is very happy to be here. What we want is to have him for as long as possible.\"\n\nGyokeres, who joined Sporting for a fee of around £20million, has already played down reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford.\n\nHe said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\n\n\"He [Amorim] probably already has strikers there. It's very sad that he left [Sporting], but of course, we understand the decision. He meant a lot to me, as he gave me an opportunity and helped me evolve a lot.",

(Image: Photo by Diogo Cardoso/Getty Images)\n\nManchester United continue to be linked with defensive reinforcements ahead of the January transfer window - and one of Ruben Amorim's former players could be an ideal Jarrad Branthwaite alternative.\n\nThe Manchester club invested heavily in the back-line over the summer with the additions of Leny Yoro from Lille, and both Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich. However, they were also heavily linked with Everton's Branthwaite and even had offers for the highly-rated England international rejected.\n\nNow, according to Sky Sports, Sporting CP's Ousmane Diomande has emerged as a transfer target for clubs in the Premier League - including Manchester City - but United might have the upper hand, given Amorim's recent arrival at Old Trafford.\n\nDiomande, 20, is an Ivory Coast international who moved to Europe in 2022 when he joined Danish outfit FC Midtjylland. He was then signed by Amorim and Sporting in January 2023 and has already made just shy of 70 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nAmorim promised he would not sign any of Sporting's players in the upcoming January transfer window, but next summer could be a whole different story, as interest in Diomande ramps up. The article goes on to state that the United head coach has already \"spoken\" with the defender in a bid to persuade him to choose the club over any of their Premier League rivals.\n\nDiomande now, reportedly, favours a reunion with his former manager as he knows it would be beneficial for his development. The defender signed a longer-term contract when he arrived almost two years ago with his current deal set to expire in the summer of 2027.\n\nIt has previously been reported he has a £69million release clause in his contract with Sporting - while the likes of Arsenal have made attempts to sign him in the past. Amorim typically used Diomande centrally in his much-talked-about back three.",

(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\n\nNever before has a Manchester United starting XI generated so much anticipation.\n\nThe prospect of Ruben Amorim installing a new formation at Old Trafford ahead of his opening game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon is creating plenty of excitement and intrigue.\n\nThe new United head coach wants to quickly install a new identity, and his best hope of doing so is by sticking to his principles from the off. Training ground footage captured earlier this week suggests he will be doing exactly that.\n\nA 3-4-3 formation will offer United a new look and a new lease of life. It will also create plenty of competition in certain areas of the squad.\n\nThe system means United will line up with two central-midfielders flanked by wing-backs. They have been so accustomed to operating with a three-man midfield in recent years. The shift means Bruno Fernandes is expected to be pushed into a more advanced role and become a member of the attack.\n\nPresuming that does transpire, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad will be competing for the final spot in the forward line if Rasmus Hojlund continues as United's chief striker. Rashford, Garnacho and Amad will all believe they are worthy of starting week-in, week-out, creating a selection headache for Amorim.\n\nAs talented as each individual is, Amad is currently the man of the moment. He has scored two goals and registered one assist in United's last two games. The right-wing is his position to lose and just about every United supporter is of the opinion he should start at Portman Road this weekend.\n\nAs adventurous and attack-minded as the Ivorian is, he is also happy to help out defensively, highlighted by his rate of three tackles per 90 in the Premier League so far this season. It is that sort of commitment and attitude Amorim is hungry to see from his players.\n\nAmad is growing into his role as a Manchester United starter. (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images.)\n\nSpeaking in his maiden interview as United boss last week, the head coach said: \"If our players take the shirt, they will know that it is the Manchester United team. Everybody thinks the same, running back, playing, enjoying. This is what drives me.\n\n\"I can say the popular thing, which is to win. Everybody wants to win and I want to win with my players, with the fans, but with an identity and one idea, that is the thing that I am focused on all the time.\"\n\nKeen to see a sense of determination and desire, Amad is an ideal option for Amorim. The winger is a hungry, driven individual, whose work ethic is excellent.\n\nAs well as averaging three tackles per 90 in the Premier League this season, which is 1.5 more than Garnacho and 2.4 more than Rashford, he has also averaged 10.8km per 90 in terms of distance covered. Garnacho (10km) and Rashford (10.1km) have covered less ground.\n\nWith those statistics in mind, as well as his recent attacking output, Amad should have every confidence of starting the first game of the Amorim era. United fans are likely to display a feeling of disgruntlement if he does not.",

      "article_text": "Antony is in last chance saloon. (Image: 2024 UEFA)\n\nThe majority of fans believe Manchester United should cut their losses on Antony. The winger's time in Manchester since he signed from Ajax in a deal worth £86million has been disastrous and he looks destined to be remembered as one of the worst signings in the club's history.\n\n“Antony is one of the most exciting young talents in European football and has exactly the right profile for the attacking, dynamic team that Erik ten Hag is building,\" said former football director John Murtough when he was signed. That statement is 25 months old but hasn't aged well.\n\nIt might have been worth double checking Antony's passport to check if he's Brazilian. He doesn't have the flair, creativity or quality that is associated with South America's greatest footballing exports, although the 'Anturny' did cause quite a stir in his first few months at the club. The 'Anturny' skill move wouldn't have been a talking point if he had enjoyed a brilliant first season but he contributed just four goals and two assists in the Premier League.\n\nAlthough Antony scored in his first three league appearances against Arsenal, Manchester City and Everton, which is remarkable with the benefit of hindsight, he didn't score in the top flight again for six months and it didn't take long for many to conclude he wasn't good enough for United.\n\nBut you should always give players the benefit of the doubt and a season to settle. Antony needed to grab the bull by the horns in his second year at Old Trafford and silence the growing doubters but he actually regressed, producing just one goal and one assist in the league.\n\n\"I definitely need more goal participations and to score more goals,\" he told a handful of journalists in a Beverly Hills hotel while on pre-season tour in August. \"It's something I demand from myself. Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\n\n\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old also vowed he would score more goals with his right foot and told reporters he would show them \"his notes one day.\" Antony does not lack self belief - he wouldn't be at United without it - but he's failed to back up his words on the pitch, which is how he's judged.\n\nAntony has hardly played. (Image: Photo by YAGIZ GURTUG/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAntony has started one game this season, against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup when he converted a penalty against League One opposition. He has been given just over 150 minutes in all competitions.\n\nTen Hag's decision to overlook Amad for Antony when he made a substitution against Fenerbahce in the Europa League was surprising, but he explained he works hard in training. To Antony's credit, he looked bright when coming on but picked up an injury and had to be stretchered off.\n\nUnfortunately for Antony, not much has gone right for him during his time in Manchester - he has dealt with issues away from the pitch - and he's in the last chance saloon at United.\n\nThe appointment of Ruben Amorim offers a clean slate but Antony must be sold in the summer window if he's unable to improve between now until the end of the season.\n\nWhat could spark that improvement? Perhaps he could play as a wing-back. It was fascinating to read him say playing at full-back initially \"annoyed\" him last season, because adapting and playing in that role in Amorim's system might be the only way to save his United career.\n\nAntony has transferable skills that could make him an effective wing-back but playing him there would be a desperate roll of the dice, with the hope of unlocking some improvement. Whether a position change would work remains to be seen. Antony's time might already be up.",

      "article_text": "Jamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nThe 39-year-old gave his first interview as the club’s new head boss last week, just days after arriving at Carrington. He underlined his eagerness to instil a sense of identity back into United and the importance of building momentum from the off.\n\nHe makes his debut at Ipswich Town on Sunday with United languishing in 13th. Amorim is expected to field his 3-4-3 formation that brought him two Portuguese titles at Sporting CP.\n\nWhile former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does “not think this squad is suited to three at the back”, he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way. \"I’ve been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,” he told The Overlap US.\n\n“He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?’\n\n“And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change’. \n\n“But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n“I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.”\n\nCarragher warned that Amorim faces heftier competition from lower-table teams in the Premier League than he did in Portugal. But he reckons that United will be put in good stead if Amorim is able to get his squad to buy in and then successfully implement his philosophy.\n\n“Let’s not forget, the Premier League has the best managers in the world and he’s coming up against some top operators, not even necessarily at the top end of the table,” Carragher added. \n\n“You look at people like Marco Silva or Thomas Frank, managers of teams in the middle of the table. They’re top managers.\n\n“I admired how confident [Amorim] was and this real belief he seems to have and if he can put that into Manchester United, because there’s still quality players there, and also make them believe in this system and how they go about it, I think he can do well.",

Biancheri, who joined United from Cardiff City in February 2023, has been in blistering form for both the under-18s and under-21s this season, scoring 13 goals in 12 appearances.\n\nSuch impressive finishing will only help Biancheri's chances of breaking into the first-team in the years ahead, as he will hope to catch the eye of head coach Ruben Amorim, who has a proven track record of giving youngsters an opportunity to impress. The 39-year-old joined the club last week from Sporting CP and will oversee his first Premier League game at Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon when United visit Portman Road.\n\nAmorim has already taken charge of his first training session as United head coach, handing young academy talents Jim Thwaites and Godwill Kukonki an opportunity to impress with the first-team.

The new Manchester United boss has already taken the reins at Old Trafford and he's preparing for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town this weekend.\n\nConfidence is high within the club that Amorim can maximise the potential of expensive acquisitions like Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund. Having met with top executives including chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth, and technical director Jason Wilcox since his arrival last week, the Portuguese tactician has been given time to evaluate his team.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the way the squad responds to Amorim's methods will influence any future transfer decisions. The 39-year-old has expressed gratitude for the trust shown by the United leadership.\n\nIn his first interview, he said: \"When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans. It's a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it's a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that.\n\nAnd we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas.\"\n\nAmorim feels a strong rapport with key figures at Manchester United and believes they are all intent on achieving greatness. He added: \"I felt a connection [with Berrada, Ashworth and Wilcox] and I felt we are in the same moment. We want to do something special in the special club. So, I think that was a key point.\"\n\nWith contracts coming to an end for Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford, the club faces many decisions. The futures of Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo are also uncertain, even though United reserve the option to extend their respective deals.\n\nHowever, Amorim is eager to get off to a quick start and he'll be counting on the youth, like Rasmus Hojlund, Kobbie Mainoo, and Alejandro Garnacho, to pull their weight. He insists that being young isn't an excuse when playing for a prestigious club.\n\n\"I don't want to say that we need time because we are a young team,\" said Amorim. \"They are prepared. They are prepared to cope with the demands of playing for Manchester United. They should be because they are here.\n\nWe know it will take time and we will try to win time with the games. But we have to start since day one without fear, without thinking that they are not used to playing like this.\n",

      "headline": "Bruno Fernandes sends subtle message to Viktor Gyokeres amid Man United transfer links",
      "article_text": "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has interacted with Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after the forward continued his fine goalscoring form for Sweden.\n\nThe Sporting striker bagged the opener in Sweden's 2-1 win over Slovakia in the Nations League on Saturday with Newcastle's Alexander Isak scoring the winner. Gyokeres has been in sensational form for his domestic club since Ruben Amorim signed him from Coventry City for £20m.\n\nSo far, the striker has managed 66 goals in just 68 appearances and such form has led to rumours that Amorim may look to reunite with his talisman at Old Trafford. Should he wish to do so, it is unlikely to be in the January transfer window with the 39-year-old United boss already pledging not to raid the Lisbon club this winter.\n\nHowever, a move next summer could be a possibility with rumours suggesting a gentleman's agreement is in place for Gyokeres to leave for around £63m should he stay in Portugal for the remainder of the season. After scoring his 11th goal for Sweden, the striker posted a short message on Instagram thanking his nation and international teammates.\n\nIn a show of support, Fernandes liked the post suggesting he is keeping tabs on Gyokeres' career. While a nice gesture, it may not necessarily be a sign of Gyokeres' impending arrival in Manchester.\n\nFernandes is a self-proclaimed fan of Sporting and does try to watch them as often as possible when in the UK. Meanwhile, at United, Amorim is focused on Sunday when he will make his debut as manager for the Reds as they visit Ipswich Town.\n\nThe new Reds boss has taken training for the first time, leaving a number of United stars impressed.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has taken training for the first time this week as he prepares for his first match in charge of Manchester United this Sunday.\n\nManchester United winger Amad was all smiles following Ruben Amorim's first training session in charge of the club this week.\n\nThe Ivorian was one of the senior players remaining in Manchester during the final international break of the year so they took part in new head coach Amorim's first session at Carrington on Monday. A mix of senior players and academy stars were put through their paces by the 39-year-old as he looks to prepare the squad for its first challenge at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nAmorim has brought a positive attitude with him to Manchester after enjoying an impressive spell at Sporting and that happiness looks to have rubbed off on Amad. Taking to Instagram, the 22-year-old shared an image of himself smiling at the training ground during his first session with the new boss.\n\nTo hammer home the point, the winger included a smiley face emoji suggesting he is more than happy with the new man in charge. Amad would be forgiven for feeling a sense of relief that Erik ten Hag has departed after his role in the first team was reduced this season.\n\nUpon the Dutchman's departure, Ruud van Nistelrooy reinstated Amad to the starting line-ups and repaid his faith with two goals against PAOK in the Europa League and an assist against Leicester City in the Premier League. Such form should make him a contender to start at Ipswich Town on Sunday with Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford also pushing for a starting spot.\n\nAntony will also be hoping a new manager will bring about a change in his fortunes although he is low down the pecking order at present.",

The Portuguese tactician took charge of his first training session on Monday, with the likes of Casemiro, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo involved, as they gear up for their trip to Suffolk on Sunday. United take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town, who are buoyant on the back of their win over Tottenham Hotspur on the eve of the international break.\n\nPreparations have been far from ideal for Amorim with a host of players injured or on duty with their countries. Manuel Ugarte, who worked alongside Amorim at Sporting CP, will return later than some of his clubmates due to Uruguay's World Cup qualification campaign - when they take on Brazil tomorrow (Wednesday 12:45am kick-off).\n\nFernandes was afforded the opportunity to return to Manchester early by manager Roberto Martinez. Portugal booked their place at the top of their UEFA Nations League group following Friday's 5-1 thrashing of Poland in Porto.\n\nIn a simple post on Instagram, the 30-year-old said: \"Privilege,\" after being granted the chance to leave their international camp early.\n\nFernandes was one of four to depart as Pedro Neto, Bernardo Silva and Cristiano Ronaldo sat out of the 1-1 draw with Croatia with the United captain suspended for the trip to Split. The Portugal national team head coach said: \"In the first stage, we made six changes from one game to the next. It’s important for us to be first – and we already are.\n\n\"We need to be competitive to add to the group, it’s getting harder and harder to get into the starting eleven. There’s a World Cup finals in 18 months. The game against Croatia is important, we need to look at other players. We’re going to let go of Bernardo Silva, Pedro Neto, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes, who is suspended – so we’re going to call up Fabio Silva and [Geovany] Quenda from the Under-21s.",

      "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nPep Guardiola has won a total of 18 trophies with Manchester City.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won.

      "headline": "Fabrizio Romano reveals Ruben Amorim’s top transfer priority ahead of January window with two targets named",
      "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position. Amorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town. The 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress. After footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back. Amorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation. And with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025. \"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\" Romano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge. “Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.” Romano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez. Romano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper. I've heard they're going to be found not guilty of all of them [the charges].\n\n\"It's just a whisper, it's unconfirmed. It's some bloke down the pub telling me, that sort of level.\n\n\"Listen, it's just a whisper. I was the first person to say Declan Rice is going to Arsenal. There's footage of me saying that from around a year before it happened, from a reliable source.\"\n\nCo-host Darren Bent did joke that the 'reliable source' was perhaps more reliable than Goldstein's City 'whisper'.\n\n_SPORTbible has contacted the Premier League for comment._\n\nBelow, in full, are the 115 charges levelled against Manchester City by the Premier League and UEFA.\n\n*   **Failure to provide accurate and up-to-date financial information from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 54 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations from December 2018-present [February 2023] -** 35 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to provide accurate financial reports for player and manager compensation from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 14 alleged breaches\n*   **Breaches of Premier League profitability and sustainability regulations from 2015/16 to and including 2017/18 -** Seven alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to comply with UEFA's regulations, including UEFA's Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations -** Five alleged breaches",

      "article_text": "Manchester City are ready to offer Erling Haaland a so-called 'mega' deal that would make him the highest paid player in Premier League history. The 24-year-old striker, who has scored 105 goals in 114 games for City, including 16 this season, is currently in talks with the Premier League champions over a new big-money contract worth £500,000 per-week. That's according to The Mirror, who suggest that his 'basic salary' would eclipse the Premier League's second-highest paid player, Kevin De Bruyne, who is currently on £400,000 per-week.\nHaaland has yet to put pen-to-paper as an 'issue' around his £150 million release clause continues to be a stumbling block, but there has been a positive response to recent negotiations.\nManchester City, meanwhile, are hoping that Pep Guardiola's decision to sign a one-year contract extension will help get Haaland's reported £100 million deal over the line.\nThat's according to The Sun, who suggest a contract extension would see Haaland remain at City for four or five more years, meaning he could potentially earn in the region of £100 million without bonuses.\nLast week, before Guardiola penned his contract extension, Haaland said: “I hope Pep signs a new contract. He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.” He added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club. Los Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes. \"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani.\n\nThe report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm.

      "article_text": "Manchester United’s players already have a ‘nickname’ for head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim, 39, arrived at the club’s Carrington Training Centre on Monday and was greeted by several members of the Red Devils’ hierarchy – including sporting director Dan Ashworth, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nOn the same day, he took charge of training for the first time, with the Portuguese having just ten senior players available due to the ongoing international break.\n\nAs a result, several academy players joined in the session.\n\nAmad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town.\n\nFans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up.\n\nThe Sport reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence.\n\n“Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained.\n\n“Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence.\n\n“There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own.\n\n“The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

      "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nHe also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10.’\n\nHowever, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\n“When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained.\n\n“Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added.\n\n“I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham].\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along.\n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome.\n\nDe Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days.\n\n“He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football...

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n“I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT.\"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

Precise in his first touches. He came off after 45 minutes of the first half.\"\n\nLiverpool fans will be happy to see that their man up front only played half of the match on Tuesday as it remains likely that he will start for their trip to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday.\n\nAfter traveling to Southampton, Liverpool will face a tough set of fixtures including back to back home matches against has Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nDarwin Nunez started both of Uruguay's matches over the international break.\n\nWith Diogo Jota still recovering from an injury sustained during the match with Chelsea, it is likely that Nunez will start, or at least feature, in all three of Liverpool's next matches.\n\nSpeaking before the international break, Arne Slot confirmed when Jota is expected to return, saying: “We expect him back after the break. The first weeks after the break, I always say there is privacy about the injury. He will be back one or two weeks after the break.",

The answer is he should be,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first-team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\"\n\nEnnis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. He could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is thought to have already been impressed by one Manchester United player in particular – and it may not be who you’d expect.\n\nAmorim, 39, was officially announced as the new head coach of Man United on November 1.\n\nBut he did not start in his new role until Monday, 11 November, when he was greeted by various members of the club’s hierarchy on his arrival at Carrington Training Centre.\n\nThe former Sporting Club boss gave his first official interview since taking the job on Friday, 15 November and explained how he and his squad will need “time” if they are to be successful.\n\nHe was also keen to stress the importance of “identity” at the football club as he mentioned former United bosses Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Matt Busby.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity,\" Amorim said.\n\n\"The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.\"\n\n\"If you work as a team, then the talent individually is going to shine,\" he added.\n\nFans will be eager to see Amorim’s first starting XI as the Red Devils travel to Portman Road, where they will face Ipswich Town on Sunday, 24 November.\n\nUnited currently sit 13th in the Premier League and have so far failed to find form at the start of the season, which ultimately saw former boss Erik ten Hag lose his job at Old Trafford.\n\nAmad is thought to have impressed his new boss. Supporters have been paying close attention to footage of first-team training as they try to guess what the first line-up under the new boss could be.\n\nAccording to reports from Give Me Sport’s Dean Jones, “insiders close to the club” have explained how United winger Amad, 22, has impressed his new boss, and he could feature “prominently” in Amorim’s usual 3-4-3 formation.\n\nThe Portuguese is thought to be pleased by the player’s technical ability and work rate off the ball – which could mean he becomes a key member of the United team moving forward.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international has played nine league games so far this season and, despite showing glimpses of promise, has scored just once with two assists.",

      "article_text": "Jamie Vardy's true feelings about wife Rebekah Vardy's feud with Coleen Rooney have been revealed after a couple of digs at her WAG rival's appearance in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.\n\nColeen, wife of former Manchester United and England star Wayne, is among the high-profile contestants for the 24th edition of the ITV show. She is rumoured to be earning a joint-record £1.5 million for heading into the jungle and has already been discussing her relationship with one of the Premier League's best ever players.\n\nAnd the row with Vardy has been reignited, with plenty of jibes being made by hosts Ant and Dec and Coleen briefly talking about the 'Wagatha Christie' 2022 trial.\n\nRebekah, a former I'm a Celeb contestant back in 2017, couldn't help but respond on Instagram, writing: \"That feeling when you are living rent free in people's heads [laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe 42-year-old is serving as a columnist for The Sun on jungle affairs and in a video doing the rounds, described Coleen as \"the gift that keeps on giving\" after her boat sank twice in episode one.\n\nFans have wondered what Leicester City striker Vardy thinks about his other half's antics but according to Rebekah, he doesn't mind it at all and is supportive of her actions.\n\nThe mum of five also claimed any abuse subjected to him on the pitch spurs him on.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Jamie is mad at me for speaking out, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,\" she said, as per The Mirror.\n\n\"He’s encouraging me, saying, ‘Give it to her, get the truth out there’. He loves it that she’s back getting headlines. The more stick he gets from the stands in football, the better he plays.\"\n\nJamie Vardy's stance on Rebekah Vardy's feud with Coleen Rooney has been revealed. Image: Getty\n\nIn a recent column for The Sun, Rebekah accused Coleen of copying her in going into I'm a Celeb and claiming \"she always wanted my life\".\n\nVardy lost the well-publicised defamation trial and after she was ordered to cover a hefty portion Coleen's legal expenses along with her costs, were estimated to total £3 million.\n",

      "headline": "Bundesliga expert tips one of 'world's best players' to sign for Liverpool and tells fans to bet on it happening",
      "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained.\n\n“I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich.\n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Welt, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That [amount] won't be enough,” Krosche said.\n\n“It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself.\n\nTyson Fury training footage concerns boxing fans\n\n\"That's an agreement we make with the players.”",

      "article_text": "Liverpool are close to ‘agreeing’ a transfer for a La Liga star as Arne Slot looks to bolster his squad in the January window.\n\nSlot, 46, has led his side to 15 wins out of 17 games since joining the club from Feyenoord following Jurgen Klopp’s departure.\n\nHe will no doubt be happy with his start as Liverpool’s manager - his team sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of Slot’s first challenges as manager was the lack of new faces in the summer transfer window.\n\nLiverpool signed just two first-team players – Federico Chiesa – plus goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nThe club tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad centre-midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with the player favouring a stay in La Liga over a move to Merseyside.\n\nBut it is another player from the Spanish topflight who could be on their way to Anfield come January.\n\nAccording to reports by Football 365, Liverpool are ‘close’ to making Loic Bade their first signing during the window in the new year.\n\nLoic Bade could be on his way to the Premier League.\n\nBade, 24, currently plays as a centre-back for struggling Sevilla and has made nine La Liga appearances for the Andalusian outfit so far this term.\n\nThe France Under-21 international had a short loan spell in the Premier League with Nottingham Forest between 2022 and 2023 but failed to make a single competitive first-team appearance at the East Midlands club.\n\nBut since moving on, he has shown promise at Sevilla despite the club sitting in 13th place in Spain’s premier division.\n\nSomething that will no doubt bring a smile to Liverpool fans’ faces is the fact that Bade scored in Sevilla’s 3-0 Europa League quarter-final win over the Premier League club’s arch-rivals Man United in April 2023.\n\nThe defender, who stands at six feet three inches, cuts a calm, composed figure at the heart of defence but would likely play as back-up to Liverpool’s first-choice central defenders Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate if he were to sign a deal at the club.\n\nThe 24-year-old’s Sevilla contract is set to run until June 2029, but it is reported that Sevilla would ‘accept’ a fee of around €30m (£25m) according to Spanish outlet todofichajes.",

      "article_text": "**Ruben Amorim has been tipped to bring one former Manchester United player back to the club in a shock move.**\n\nAfter signing last month, former Sporting manager Amorim joined United last week, replacing interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy who stood in as United boss after Erik ten Hag was sacked last month.\n\nSince joining, the new boss has made his mark with his intense training sessions and the promising comments made during his first interview with the club.\n\nBut now, Amorim could make a huge decision which would send shockwaves through the fanbase by bringing a former player back to United.\n\nWhile speaking to Casino24.dk, ex-player Wes Brown suggested that Amorim should consider facilitating the return of Paul Pogba following the reduction of his suspension last month.\n\n\"Manchester United have a new manager, Paul Pogba needs a new club and anything can happen in football,\" Brown noted\n\n\"Paul is desperate to get back playing and if there was a transfer fee you couldn't see it, but as a free agent it's a different ball game completely.\n\n\"There will be money involved but it could be relatively risk-free and he'll be desperate to impress.\"\n\nPogba left United for the second time in 2022, spending a couple of turbulent years with Serie A club Juventus before being suspended from playing in September 2023 due to a failed drug test.\n\nWhen the ban was initially handed to him in February 2024, it was set to last for four years, no doubt putting an end to his career, but in October it was reduced to just 18 months, meaning the Frenchman can return to play in March.\n\nHowever, Pogba decided that when he did return to the pitch, it would not be with Juventus as he announced last week that both he and the Italian club had mutually agreed to terminate his contract early, leaving him as a free agent.\n\nAnnouncing the decision in an official statement, Pogba wrote: \"My time at Juventus has come to an end.\n\n\"It has been a privilege to pull on the shirt of the bianconeri and to share so many special moments together.\n\n\"I cherish the moments we made. They live on\"",

      "headline": "Trent Alexander-Arnold named 'untouchable' player as his toughest-ever opponent in England training",
      "article_text": "Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold has revealed who his toughest opponent in England training has been – and it may not be who you’d expect. Alexander-Arnold, 26, is arguably one of the best players in his position and currently sports Club World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup (x2) medals since making his debut for the Reds in October 2016. During his trophy-laden career, the Liverpudlian has faced several world-class players, having played in three Champions League finals, the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2024. The defender has competed against the likes of Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, as well as playing alongside Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham for the Three Lions. But it was a player who is currently without a club who he put above them all after Bellingham had named Kyle Walker as his toughest opponent in England training earlier in the conversation. “I would say Dele (Alli),” Alexander-Arnold told the Lions’ Den podcast on England's official YouTube channel in July 2024. “My first few camps, when I was younger, and he was at the top of his game at that time.” \"He was untouchable,\" he added. Dele, 28, has been without a club since his Everton contract expired in June 2024, but he has never really put together a consistent run of good form since he left Spurs in January 2022. The MK Dons academy graduate crossed paths with Alexander-Arnold at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, starting in the 2-1 semi-final loss against Croatia. Dele made an appearance on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show in April 2024 and was fairly vocal about wanting to return to the top of his game. \"I spoke about it in my interview and don't want to go over it too much again – but I know my level as a player and what I can get to,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to even watch football. It's been tough for me, I'd say, this past eight months has been hard to watch.\" \"You know you can set reminders on your phone, I have a reminder at 11 o'clock every day that says, 'World Cup 2026'\" he added. \"That's my aim for now. I think that people will be like, 'he hasn't played in a year,' but I don't care, I know my level.”",

        "article_text": "Antony's agent, Junior Pedroso, has said there is truth behind reports claiming Liverpool had interest in signing the Manchester United winger in 2022.\n\nIn a report issued by The Times on Tuesday, it was claimed Liverpool had interest in signing the Brazilian as they waited for Mohamed Salah to make a decision on his future.\n\nSalah signed a new contract at Anfield in July 2022, committing his future to the club until June 2025, meaning the Merseysiders' interest in Antony went no further.\n\nThe winger, of course, did seal an exit from Ajax later that summer, joining United in a deal worth more than £80million. He has struggled to live up to expectations at Old Trafford thus far, scoring 12 goals in 87 appearances.\n\nAmid recent speculation, Pedroso has now confirmed Liverpool were considering a move for Antony prior to Salah putting pen to paper on a new deal ahead of the 2022/23 season.\n\nSpeaking to winwin.com, Pedroso said: \"Yes, this story has a basis in truth. No (negotiations stopped as), Salah renewed his contract at the time with Liverpool, and that made Antony's move to Liverpool impossible.\" \n\nAntony was hand-picked by former United manager Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022 having previously worked with him at Ajax. United had strengthened their right-wing options the previous summer, signing Jadon Sancho, but he had failed to deliver the goods in his first season at Old Trafford.\n\nHowever, despite scoring on his United debut against Arsenal, Antony is in danger of going down as one of the Premier League's biggest ever flops. He has scored just five goals in 56 league games for the Reds.\n\nHe has featured in just two of their opening 11 league matches this season, with his only start across all competitions coming in the 7-0 win over Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round.

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is going to have a lot to consider ahead of his first game in charge of Man United this weekend.\n\nRuben Amorim will be determined to hit the ground running. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\n\nNever before has a Manchester United starting XI generated so much anticipation.\n\nThe prospect of Ruben Amorim installing a new formation at Old Trafford ahead of his opening game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon is creating plenty of excitement and intrigue.\n\nThe new United head coach wants to quickly install a new identity, and his best hope of doing so is by sticking to his principles from the off. Training ground footage captured earlier this week suggests he will be doing exactly that.\n\nA 3-4-3 formation will offer United a new look and a new lease of life. It will also create plenty of competition in certain areas of the squad.\n\nThe system means United will line up with two central-midfielders flanked by wing-backs. They have been so accustomed to operating with a three-man midfield in recent years. The shift means Bruno Fernandes is expected to be pushed into a more advanced role and become a member of the attack.\n\nPresuming that does transpire, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad will be competing for the final spot in the forward line if Rasmus Hojlund continues as United's chief striker. Rashford, Garnacho and Amad will all believe they are worthy of starting week-in, week-out, creating a selection headache for Amorim.\n\nAs talented as each individual is, Amad is currently the man of the moment. He has scored two goals and registered one assist in United's last two games. The right-wing is his position to lose and just about every United supporter is of the opinion he should start at Portman Road this weekend.\n\nAs adventurous and attack-minded as the Ivorian is, he is also happy to help out defensively, highlighted by his rate of three tackles per 90 in the Premier League so far this season. It is that sort of commitment and attitude Amorim is hungry to see from his players.\n\nAmad is growing into his role as a Manchester United starter. (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images.)\n\nSpeaking in his maiden interview as United boss last week, the head coach said: \"If our players take the shirt, they will know that it is the Manchester United team. Everybody thinks the same, running back, playing, enjoying. This is what drives me.\n\n\"I can say the popular thing, which is to win. Everybody wants to win and I want to win with my players, with the fans, but with an identity and one idea, that is the thing that I am focused on all the time.\"\n\nKeen to see a sense of determination and desire, Amad is an ideal option for Amorim. The winger is a hungry, driven individual, whose work ethic is excellent.\n\nAs well as averaging three tackles per 90 in the Premier League this season, which is 1.5 more than Garnacho and 2.4 more than Rashford, he has also averaged 10.8km per 90 in terms of distance covered. Garnacho (10km) and Rashford (10.1km) have covered less ground.\n\nWith those statistics in mind, as well as his recent attacking output, Amad should have every confidence of starting the first game of the Amorim era. United fans are likely to display a feeling of disgruntlement if he does not.",

The new Manchester United boss has already taken the reins at Old Trafford and he's preparing for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town this weekend.\n\nConfidence is high within the club that Amorim can maximise the potential of expensive acquisitions like Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund. Having met with top executives including chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth, and technical director Jason Wilcox since his arrival last week, the Portuguese tactician has been given time to evaluate his team.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the way the squad responds to Amorim's methods will influence any future transfer decisions. The 39-year-old has expressed gratitude for the trust shown by the United leadership.\n\nIn his first interview, he said: \"When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans. It's a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it's a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that.\n\nAnd we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas.\"\n\nAmorim feels a strong rapport with key figures at Manchester United and believes they are all intent on achieving greatness. He added: \"I felt a connection [with Berrada, Ashworth and Wilcox] and I felt we are in the same moment. We want to do something special in the special club. So, I think that was a key point.\"\n\nWith contracts coming to an end for Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans at Old Trafford, the club faces many decisions. The futures of Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo are also uncertain, even though United reserve the option to extend their respective deals.\n\nHowever, Amorim is eager to get off to a quick start and he'll be counting on the youth, like Rasmus Hojlund, Kobbie Mainoo, and Alejandro Garnacho, to pull their weight. He insists that being young isn't an excuse when playing for a prestigious club.\n\n\"I don't want to say that we need time because we are a young team,\" said Amorim. \"They are prepared. They are prepared to cope with the demands of playing for Manchester United. They should be because they are here.\n\nWe know it will take time and we will try to win time with the games. But we have to start since day one without fear, without thinking that they are not used to playing like this.\n",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nPep Guardiola has won a total of 18 trophies with Manchester City.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won.

        "article_text": "Manchester City are ready to offer Erling Haaland a so-called 'mega' deal that would make him the highest paid player in Premier League history. The 24-year-old striker, who has scored 105 goals in 114 games for City, including 16 this season, is currently in talks with the Premier League champions over a new big-money contract worth £500,000 per-week. That's according to The Mirror, who suggest that his 'basic salary' would eclipse the Premier League's second-highest paid player, Kevin De Bruyne, who is currently on £400,000 per-week.\nHaaland has yet to put pen-to-paper as an 'issue' around his £150 million release clause continues to be a stumbling block, but there has been a positive response to recent negotiations.\nManchester City, meanwhile, are hoping that Pep Guardiola's decision to sign a one-year contract extension will help get Haaland's reported £100 million deal over the line.\nThat's according to The Sun, who suggest a contract extension would see Haaland remain at City for four or five more years, meaning he could potentially earn in the region of £100 million without bonuses.\nLast week, before Guardiola penned his contract extension, Haaland said: “I hope Pep signs a new contract. He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.” He added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club. Los Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes. \"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani.\n\nThe report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

Precise in his first touches. He came off after 45 minutes of the first half.\"\n\nLiverpool fans will be happy to see that their man up front only played half of the match on Tuesday as it remains likely that he will start for their trip to St Mary's Stadium to face Southampton on Sunday.\n\nAfter traveling to Southampton, Liverpool will face a tough set of fixtures including back to back home matches against has Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nDarwin Nunez started both of Uruguay's matches over the international break.\n\nWith Diogo Jota still recovering from an injury sustained during the match with Chelsea, it is likely that Nunez will start, or at least feature, in all three of Liverpool's next matches.\n\nSpeaking before the international break, Arne Slot confirmed when Jota is expected to return, saying: “We expect him back after the break.

Amad scored 14 goals in 42 games for the Championship side as Sunderland reached the play-offs.\n\nPellistri was due to leave on loan in the summer but ended up remaining at United after Amad sustained a knee injury in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July.\n\nAmad returned to training in early December and he performed creditably off the bench in the loss at Forest.",

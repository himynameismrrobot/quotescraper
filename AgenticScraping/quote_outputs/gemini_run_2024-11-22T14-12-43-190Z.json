      "headline": "09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules, published at 09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules",
      "article_text": "**Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.**\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\".\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City. Today's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nThe Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future.\n\nHowever, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity. City made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote. City argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League.\n\nIn October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated. Manchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.",

Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\n**Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\n**Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton**\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\n**Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich**\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\n**Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford**\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\n**Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves**\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\n**Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\n**Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\n**Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth**\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\n**Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves**\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\n**Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton**\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\n**Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\n**Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton**\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\n\n**Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)**\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

      "headline": "'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
      "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\n\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\n\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\n\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\n\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim can create magic'\n\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\n\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"",

      "article_text": "Manchester United released a seven-minute video on Monday to mark Ruben Amorim's first training session as the club's head coach.\n\nPlayers including Casemiro and Marcus Rashford put out positive posts on their social media accounts to state how well it had gone.\n\nThe editing of a session that would normally last more than an hour gave a few small clues about Amorim's thinking before his first match in charge at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nThere was also a bit of fitness news - and a definite subtle message to try to suggest issues from Erik ten Hag's tenure are now being addressed.\n\nbbc sport's Simon Stone picked out five key themes:\n\nWho was there?\n\nEngland duo Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo, and new signing Leny Yoro, were all involved as they step up their recovery from recent injuries.\n\nShaw has not featured for United since February, Mainoo's last game was at Aston Villa on 6 October and Yoro is still to make his debut since his £52m move from Lille in the summer.\n\nHarry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof were not shown playing any part. All missed international duty this month through injury.\n\nAndre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were all absent on international duty.\n\nFormation & back three?\n\nMuch of the debate around Amorim's appointment has centred around his tactics and how he preferred to operate with three central defenders and two wing-backs at Sporting, an alien concept at United going back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\n\nAmorim said in his interview with club media on Friday fans would see \"an idea\" at Portman Road this weekend. Judging by this footage, a back three will be part of that.\n\nJonny Evans was flanked by Yoro to his right and Shaw to the left. Antony was the right wing-back, Tyrell Malacia the left wing-back.\n\nCasemiro and Mainoo filled the deeper midfield slots, with Mason Mount - who applied a first-time finish to an Antony cross - Amad Diallo and Rashford in the forward roles.\n\n'Speed it up' - Recovery sprints & intensity\n\nOne of the major criticisms of recent United incarnations, going back long before Ten Hag's time, is a lack of work-rate, particularly when it comes to tracking back.\n\nUnited are not saying who signed off the video edit but it seems fairly clear some thought has gone into what was released.\n\nIn possession and attacking, four times, players were shown chasing back hard after Amorim had given the signal for a lost ball and a counter-attack.\n\nIt was repeated so often in such a short space of time, it was as though someone at Old Trafford wanted it to be known Amorim is trying to address United's issues in transition.\n\nMainoo positioning\n\nIn the summer, Mainoo was one of three players - Hojlund and Garnacho being the others - who were ring-fenced as United made it clear they were willing to listen to offers for virtually all their first-team squad.\n\nAs a local boy and academy graduate, Mainoo, 19, is the pin-up boy for how the club wants to be represented.\n\nSo, while it is safe to assume Amorim singled out more than one player for a spot of impromptu coaching, the discussion with Mainoo was the one that made it into the public domain.\n\nAmorim showed Mainoo what he wanted from him in terms of body shape and positioning - and what different options he could have by moving just a short distance.\n\nHead coach not manager\n\nIt is worth remembering Amorim has been appointed as head coach, not a manager, as Ten Hag had been.\n\nIt is Amorim who is guiding players through the patterns he wants to establish.\n\nThere were smiles alongside the messages in the edit of Amorim on Monday. The nearest we saw to ferocity was his demand to \"not lose the ball\" seconds before intervening to tell Evans they had lost possession and needed to regain their position.\n\nIt was insightful to a point. But it was also the picture United wanted the world to see.",

      "headline": "concerns as to the suitability",
      "article_text": "**As Manchester United supporters prepare to welcome a highly-rated and talented coach from outside of Europe's 'big five' leagues who has analysts swooning, they may be worried that it all sounds a bit familiar.**\n\nBut in Ruben Amorim, they can be certain that in one crucial aspect he won't be anything like Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe defining complaint about the sacked Dutchman was that after two-and-a-bit seasons the football was still formless and the tactical direction indecipherable.\n\nAmorim, who will leave Portuguese champions Sporting to move to Old Trafford next month, is nothing if not a diligent - and decisive - tactical thinker.\n\nFrom a ruthless press to proactive possession football, from a daring high line to a complexly shape-shifting 3-4-3 formation, the hallmarks of Amorim's football will be etched into muscle memory in detailed training sessions.\n\nAnd there will be valid concerns. Most prominent will be how a Manchester United squad built in Ten Hag's image will cope with the change to a back three and a tactical system entirely at odds with what came before. It won't suit everyone.\n\nWith United posting a £113m net loss for 2023-24, a £15m compensation bill for sacking Ten Hag and paying at least £9m to get Amorim out of Sporting, added to the £200m spent on summer transfers, the Portuguese is not likely to have much budget for January signings.\n\nHere's a look at the biggest winners and losers from Amorim's appointment.\n\nAmorim is, first and foremost, a flexible tactician.\n\nHe will sit deep when required and push high when he can; will play neat possession football in some fixtures and tell his players to hit longer diagonals out to the wide men in others.\n\nCase in point: Sporting topped the charts in Portugal for both build-up attacks (126) and direct attacks (74) last season.\n\nBut one thing that doesn't change is the 3-4-3 formation, which is rumoured to be a factor in why Liverpool favoured Arne Slot over Amorim when Jurgen Klopp left this summer.\n\nThat means Manchester United will revert to a back three for the first time in a decade - since the early days of Louis van Gaal in 2014.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt, the marquee summer signing, is the most likely to struggle. He didn't look comfortable when Bayern Munich experimented with a back three under Julian Nagelsmann in 2022-23 and was dropped from van Gaal's Netherlands back three just one game into the 2022 World Cup.\n\nHarry Maguire is the only United player used to a back three, and inexperience here is a particular concern given that Amorim's aggressive high line leaves space out wide and in behind.\n\nThe Premier League is increasingly defined by the sort of fast transitions that could expose this vulnerability, and we saw the downside of Amorim's approach when Manchester City tore through Sporting in a 2022 5-0 Champions League win in Lisbon.\n\nThen again, any downside from the switch may be countered by the basic defensive advantage of moving from a four to a five.\n\nAfter all, last season United conceded the second most shots of any team in Europe's 'big five' leagues (667), whereas Sporting, in a compact off-the-ball 5-4-1, conceded the fewest shots in the Primeira Liga (269).\n\nThe wing-backs play a crucial attacking role in Amorim teams, stretching the play to allow the wingers to drift infield and get tight to the striker.\n\nUnited do not have any natural wing-backs in the squad but if Amorim is to convert a couple he will prioritise the players more comfortable attacking than defending.\n\nThat's an accurate description of Diogo Dalot, who created 38 chances in the Premier League last season - the third most of any United player - and could be pushed forward.\n\nNot that the defensive side isn't important. Dalot has come under fire this season for difficulties defending the back post.\n\nFor an alternative, Amorim could go maverick, or delve into United's highly rated youth set-up.\n\nHe has already converted Sporting's tricky 17-year-old winger Geovany Quenda into a wing-back this season. Maybe Amad Diallo, then, will be a surprise rival to Dalot on that side.\n\nThe man signed to close Ten Hag's infamous donut - the midfield hole that opens up when United's forwards press and defenders backtrack – has previously enjoyed success under Amorim.\n\nUgarte made his name at Sporting, where in 2022-23 he topped the Portuguese charts for tackles and interceptions as the chief destroyer in Amorim's double pivot.\n\nHe can be the leader on the field; the man already embodying Amorim's tactics and inspiring others to match his intensity.\n\nAmorim's wingers, who sit just behind the striker to form a box-shape with the two central midfielders, tend to be direct runners capable of pressing hard and weaving their way through the lines in the transition.\n\nIn other words, Amorim prefers the polar opposite of the mercurial Bruno Fernandes, a traditional number 10 whose free roaming might not work in such a fine-tuned system.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho, on the other hand, could be the perfect fit. He loves to dribble through a crowd, completing 41 progressive carries this campaign, not far off double that of any other United player.\n\nAnother possible beneficiary is Marcus Rashford, who loves to cut in off the left and run at defenders. In 2022-23, when he scored 30 goals in all competitions, the England forward attempted more dribbles (138) than any other Premier League player bar Bukayo Saka.\n\nHowever, Rashford would need to recapture those 2022-23 levels, with his progressive ball carry figures only at 16 this season.\n\nViktor Gyokeres has been a revelation for Amorim, scoring 41 goals in 42 league games with a mixture of targeted runs, pressing intensity, and power in the penalty area.\n\nAmorim moved to a slightly more direct style of football after Gyokeres joined from Coventry City last summer, upping the verticality of his team to get it into the feet of his powerful frontman.\n\nThat adaptation is instructive.\n\nAmorim is more than willing to alter his tactical set-up to suit the strengths and limitations of his players, suggesting that even those players who don't look like an obvious fit could find a manager willing to bend for now... well apart from three at the back.",

      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim will face the media as Manchester United head coach for the very first time at Carrington this afternoon to look ahead to Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on November 1, arrived in England on November 11 and started work on the training ground with his players at the beginning of this week.\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon chief, who is keen to install a new identity at Old Trafford, will be itching to make a winning start at Portman Road this weekend and begin the process of turning United's fortunes around.\n\nUnited did not present Amorim to the media at an official unveiling after his arrival in England last week, meaning his pre-match press conference this afternoon will be his first meeting with the British media.\n\nAs a result, he is expected to be quizzed on a wide range of topics, as well as issuing an update on the latest team news and looking ahead to the trip to Portman Road.\n\nAmorim on Mourinho message:\n\n“Jose Mourinho sent me a message. He said it is a big club, with lovely people. It still is. That is correct.”\n\nAmorim: I am the right guy in the right moment:\n\n'Call me naive. But I truly believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the world still will turn, the sun will rise again, I don’t worry about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job.'\n\nAmorim: This is not a revolution:\n\n\"It is not revolution because football is not so different with five players at the back or four or three.\n\nWe have our own ideas. We have our way we see football and we will change the way we play.\"\n\nAmorim: We need to improve a lot to win titles:\n\n\"We have space to grow as a team and we need to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing in the middle of the season with a different way of playing. We need to improve the physical aspect of the team. \n\nI don't know how long it will take but I know we need to win games at Manchester United. I will not tell you we need a lot of time but we need to improve a lot to win titles.\"\n\nAmorim feels United are aligned with his views:\n\n\"I am a dreamer and I believe in myself. I believe in the club and we have the same idea and same mindset.\n\nI think we have room to improve and I want to try new things.\"\n\nAmorim: I feel at home:\n\n\"It's bigger. There's a lot of departments which is different to Sporting. It is a global club with so much to do, not just coaching the team. I have a lot of help and I am very happy and very comfortable.

We need to be better running back and I think that’s clear for everybody. We have to be clear in the small details.",

      "article_text": "For Manchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim, today is likely to be the day when the extent of the challenge that lies ahead of him becomes real.\n\nThe Portuguese will face the media for the very first time as United boss ahead of this Sunday's clash with Ipswich Town in the Premier League. Since becoming the new boss, Amorim's media duties have remained either in-house or in front of the Portuguese journalists while still Sporting manager.\n\nHowever, today marks his first press conference in the United Kingdom as the Reds' boss and we can expect the new manager to touch on plenty of topics. As well as previewing his Premier League debut; transfers, future goals and his assessment of the current squad are likely to all be on the agenda too.\n\nWhile Amorim talking to the media is the big talking point of the day, there are other areas to focus on too. The January transfer window is just around the corner and speculation about potential signings is beginning to hot up.\n\nViktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with the Reds however a deal for the Swede is more likely to be completed in the summer than this winter.\n\n### Potential Alphonso Davies blow\n\nReal Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.\n\nOne of the clubs interested in his signature is Real with Football Espana stating the Spanish giants are 'favourites' and are 'confident' on securing his services from next summer onwards. Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, is expected to lose one of the two at the end of the season, though it's said it cannot be ruled out that both end up moving on.\n\n### Amorim is everything Ten Hag wasn't\n\nSpeaking to Casino Hawks, former Premier League midfielder Emmanuel Petit believes that Amorim has that added ingredient which Ten Hag lacked at Old Trafford.\n\nAmorim will stick with his philosophy, his tactics and his style at United, Erik ten Hag was changing tactics in every game. There is something very different about Amorim, he has the passion and the communication, everything Ten Hag was missing. Amorim has shown what he can do when his Sporting side beat Manchester City, that might be a taster of what he can do at United.\n\n### When will Ruben Amorim's press-conference start?\n\nRuben Amorim will speak to the English media for the first time this afternoon since becoming head coach of Manchester United.\n\nHis first duties with the media in this country are scheduled to begin at 2pm. Man United will be showing live coverage of the press conference on their in-house television channel, MUTV.",

      "article_text": "The United Kingdom has been hit with wintery weather including snow and ice this week as temperatures dropped.\n\nAcross the north of England, schools were closed earlier this week as freezing temperatures led to hazardous conditions on the roads. Of course, when the weather turns cold, sporting fixtures up and down the UK suddenly go into doubt.\n\nPremier League stadiums these days are equipped with undersoil heating and state-of-the-art frost covers which prevent pitches from freezing when the temperatures drop. However, while the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United do not have to worry about their pitches being up to scratch, there is concern about the surrounding areas.\n\nMatches have been called off in the past should authorities believe that roads and footpaths outside the stadium are too treacherous for supporters to attend. As such, all eyes are on the weather forecasts to see if either Manchester club will be facing another football-free weekend.\n\nCity are first up this weekend with their game taking place at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening. According to the Met Office, today is expected to be a cold one in Manchester with temperatures reaching a maximum of 5C.\n\nIcy conditions are expected on the roads and temperatures could drop to as low as -2C overnight. However, rain is expected while we are tucked up in bed as Storm Bert brings 'a widely unsettled' day.\n\nWhile the rain could be torrential at times for some, it will melt away any remaining snow and ice with temperatures rising to 12C. This should, in theory, mean that City's game will be on.\n\nIn even less doubt this weekend is United's trip to Ipswich Town. Suffolk has not been hit with the same wintery blast as Manchester and as such there should not be any issues at this stage for Ruben Amorim's debut to be postponed.",

Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony.\n\nQuickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to. They're not ready.\"\n\nRodri has been out of action since sustaining a knee ligament injury in a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on September 22.\n\nNow, the Spanish midfielder has finally spoke out about the Ballon d’Or debacle.\n\n“I think he’s a smart guy and with time you’ll realize that the more you pay attention on the field, the better he [Vini Jr] will be,\" Rodri told Spanish TV programme El Largeuro.\n\n“Athletes are not just what you represent on the field, but also off it.”\n\nBut it was Vini Jr's Brazil teammate Neymar who could not help but give his thoughts on Rodri's words with a five-word dig in the comment section of Futeousadia's Instagram post.\n\nThe Al Hilal man commented: \"Virou falador agora (he becomes a talker now - in English).\"\n\nNeymar previously referred to the Real Madrid man as a \"great idol\" and \"hero\" for the people of Brazil even explaining how he didn't \"think there's anyone but him [Vini Jr] to win it [Ballon d'Or]\" when speaking to SNTV in October.\n\nThe former Barcelona man has also never won the Ballon d’Or despite arguably being one of the best players over the last 15 years.\n\nIn Neymar’s case, he was up against the seemingly unstoppable Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with this year’s nominee list being the only one to not feature one of the pairing since 2003.",

      "article_text": "**Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken out about the club's 115 financial fair play charges just one day after signing a two-year extension on his deal.**\n\nAfter a two week international break, the Premier League is back in action on Saturday with several exciting clashes including a match between defending champions City and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nJust days before the match, City fans were treated to the news that legendary manager Guardiola had signed a new deal with the club, extending his stay there until the summer of 2027.\n\nHaving signed the new deal, Guardiola has now spoken out again about City's 115 charges regarding breaches of the Premier League's FFP rules, and his comments are not going to sit well with rival fans.\n\nAt the start of the season, the Catalan manager claimed that he would stand by the club even if they were found guilty of the 115 charges and relegated to a lower tier of the English football ladder.\n\nAnd now, much to the dismay of rivals hoping he would leave City in the near future, he has doubled down on his promise.\n\nSpeaking ahed of City's clash with Tottenham this weekend, Guardiola said: \"I said six months ago, when all the clubs accused us of doing something wrong, [and was asked] what happened if we are relegated. I will be here.\n\n\"Next year, if we are in the Conference we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now.\n\n\"I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, 'It's the last year of Pep'. I don't want to be in that position.\"\n\nHowever, the five-time Premier League winner admitted that if results for City turned for the worst, then he would consider leaving the club and pursuing a career elsewhere.\n\n\"I would like to stay for the two years but I know if the results are not good it will not be two years,\" added Guardiola.\n\nSo far in the 2024/25 Premier League season, City have struggled to match the standard set by themselves in previous seasons, as they continue to miss midfield star Rodri who suffered a season-ending injury in September.",

      "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?\" by the club’s social media channels when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability\".\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “Kai Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention “striker” qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fan’s claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference.\n\n“The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations. I think he’s an amazing example of that.”",

      "article_text": "Ally McCoist has opened up on living with Dupuytren’s contracture; an incurable condition that causes his fingers to bend towards his palms.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Rangers striker, who recently received an OBE for services to football and broadcasting, is arguably one of the most popular pundits in the game through his work with Amazon Prime, TNT Sports and ITV.\n\nHe is also a regular on radio station talkSPORT and this week, McCoist revealed that he is suffering from an incurable condition that impacts his everyday life.\n\nDupuytren's contracture, also known as Viking disease, is an abnormal thickening of the skin in the palm of the hand which can cause the fingers to curl towards the palm or pull sideways.\n\nIt has been given the name Viking disease due to its prevalence in the north of Europe and those of Northern European descent. According to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in. \n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool. Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three.\n\n“I don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n“Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

      "article_text": "Lyon winger Rayan Cherki's stats have been compared to Premier League talents Cole Palmer and Phil Foden amid his transfer links to Liverpool.\n\nLast week it was reported that Liverpool were considering making a move for French winger Cherki as a potential replacement to superstar Mohamed Salah if they are unable to agree on a new deal for the Egyptian.\n\nThe 21-year-old has impressed in recent years, drawing attention from some of the biggest clubs across Europe, including Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBut how would Cherki compare with the links of some of the best young talents in the Premier League if he were to secure a move to Liverpool in the summer?\n\nThroughout his career, the 21-year-old attacker has been compared to Eden Hazard due to his style of play, abilities with both feet and his physical build, but when considering his stats against players like Palmer and Foden, we learn a lot about Cherki.\n\nSo far this season, stats provided by Opta, via Squawka, show that Cherki has made seven domestic appearances for the Ligue One side, scoring one goal and assisting another, while averaging 0.8 shots on target per 90 minutes played.\n\nMeanwhile Foden is yet to score a Premier League goal this season despite featuring in eight matches for reigning champions Manchester City.\n\nThe Englishman, who has over 100 minutes more than Cherki this season, has one assist in the League so far and averages just 0.2 shots on target per 90.\n\nFar in front of both Cherki and Foden in terms of stats this season is Chelsea superstar Palmer, who has scored an impressive seven goals and assisted five in 11 Premier League appearances.\n\nAnd, while the 22-year-old has enjoyed considerably more minutes than either Cherki or Foden, he boasts the most shots on target per 90 minutes with an average of 1.3.\n\nDespite this, according to FBref, Cherki ranks very well when compared with other wingers and attacking midfielders across Europe's top five leagues for expected assists and shot-creating actions.\n\nHe also sits in the 97th percentile for progressive passes and compares well against players like Leroy Sane and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHowever, Cherki is very low in terms of defensive metrics, but this could be due to Lyon's style of play.",

      "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to the Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not typical goal-scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create the space for them.",

      "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.”",

      "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates on the list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.",

      "article_text": "TalkSPORT presenter Andy Goldstein has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard surrounding Manchester City's 115 charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nCity's charges relate largely to Premier League rules, although a minority of them relate to UEFA.\n\nA hearing into the charges is currently being held in private, meaning little information has been released to the public. After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper. I've heard they're going to be found not guilty of all of them [the charges].\n\n\"It's just a whisper, it's unconfirmed. It's some bloke down the pub telling me, that sort of level.\n\n\"Listen, it's just a whisper. I was the first person to say Declan Rice is going to Arsenal. There's footage of me saying that from around a year before it happened, from a reliable source.\"\n\nCo-host Darren Bent did joke that the 'reliable source' was perhaps more reliable than Goldstein's City 'whisper'.\n\nSPORTbible has contacted the Premier League for comment.\n\nBelow, in full, are the 115 charges levelled against Manchester City by the Premier League and UEFA:\n\n*   **Failure to provide accurate and up-to-date financial information from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 54 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations from December 2018-present [February 2023] -** 35 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to provide accurate financial reports for player and manager compensation from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 14 alleged breaches\n*   **Breaches of Premier League profitability and sustainability regulations from 2015/16 to and including 2017/18 -** Seven alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to comply with UEFA's regulations, including UEFA's Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations -** Five alleged breaches",

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up. If you let up, it's over, then you'll go under.\"",

      "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\" \n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n“If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

      "headline": "Roy Keane reveals why he chose to wear 16 on his shirt at Man Utd after Sir Alex Ferguson offered him a different number",
      "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nHe also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap. “When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained. “Then when the number came in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham]. And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along. \n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome. De Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016. “Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

      "article_text": "**Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.** Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour. Jenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'.\n\nAnd now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband. According to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family. My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy. Now I just want to move forward. Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.”\n\nDespite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future. \"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added. \"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future. He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.”\n\nWhen details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie. He said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault. The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family. There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.” “Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human. When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.”",

      "article_text": "Liverpool fans have made their mind up about Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid after seeing what just appeared in the Spanish capital.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, 26, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be able to start talks with foreign clubs from January 1, 2025.\n\nThe Liverpool man has played an integral part in the club's early season success under new boss Arne Slot - the Reds currently sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, arguably the biggest negative surrounding the club is the contractual situation of Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, and Virgil van Dijk – all three are out of contract at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nAlthough there is no doubting the ability of Van Dijk and Salah, the ages – 33 and 32, respectively – of the players could be a sticking point in contract negotiations.\n\nHowever, with Alexander-Arnold at 26 and arguably approaching his peak, losing him, especially without receiving a transfer fee, would be far from ideal for the Reds.\n\nAlthough the situation is still unclear, Liverpool supporters were shocked when they came across a giant advert of the player in Madrid, posted to X by Anfield Wrap.\n\nThe Liverpool defender was pictured alongside model and actress Iris Law for a shoot for fashion brand 'Guess' on a billboard, which was emblazoned on the side of a building located at Plaza Felipe II – the place where thousands of Liverpool fans gathered ahead of their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final held in the city.\n\nFans were quick to offer their thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOne fan said: “If he goes, he goes, [it] won't go down well with LFC fans if he walks away for nothing. I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

      "article_text": "Liverpool are ‘planning’ a move for an in-form Premier League forward – but they may have to compete with a rival to sign the player.\n\nLiverpool have started the season in excellent fashion, with new manager Arne Slot seeing his side pick up 15 wins in his first 17 games in charge of the Reds.\n\nThe Merseyside-based side also sit top of both the Premier League and the 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of the first challenges faced by Slot when he arrived was the lack of new players coming into the club during the summer transfer window.\n\nJust Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili were recruited, with the Georgian ‘keeper instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nThe Reds tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad ‘number six’ Martin Zubimendi, but so far, Ryan Gravenberch has performed well in the role.\n\nDespite most things currently being positive at the club, the only real negatives are the contractual situations Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk find themselves in – all three are out of contract at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, the club are now ‘weighing’ up a move for the Egyptian's potential replacement, according to The Sun.\n\nLiverpool are thought to be keen on Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, 25, who has been in impressive form, having already netted eight goals in 11 appearances for the Bees this term.\n\nMbeumo is most comfortable playing as a right forward/winger, which happens to be the position Salah takes up in the Liverpool side.\n\nBut Slot’s side may be in for some tough competition to sign the player as Newcastle United have been ‘watching’ the player, who is said to be highly regarded by Magpies’ boss Eddie Howe.\n\nThe report suggests the Tynesiders may be willing to offer Callum Wilson as part of a potential £50m deal, but it is still unclear if talks are underway between either of the clubs.\n\nWhat has Bryan Mbeumo said about a potential transfer?\nBack in May 2024, the France-born Cameroon international admitted he would like to play at the “best clubs”.\n\n“I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone, but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs,\" he said in an interview with L’Equipe.\n\n\"It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me.

        "headline": "09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules, published at 09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules",
        "article_text": "**Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.** At a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs). Clubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support. For changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour. Friday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City. APT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\". The Premier League said the rule changes relate to \"integrating the assessment of shareholder loans\" and \"include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year\". \"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement. Sources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes. Manchester City's representative declined to speak. This will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City. Today's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated. Had seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation. The Premier League may also have been concerned that defeat today could have had an adverse impact on the ongoing case that has seen City face more than 100 charges of alleged financial rule breaches. City deny wrongdoing in a saga that could prove seismic for the club's future. However, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity. City made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them. Sources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote. City argued that no vote should have taken place on Friday, while Villa called for a postponement as the \"acrimonious back and forth\" was \"weakening\" the Premier League. In October, both the Premier League and Manchester City claimed victory after the decision of an arbitration panel over APTs, which seek to ensure sponsorships with companies linked to clubs' owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated. Manchester City had some of their complaints upheld, with two aspects of the rules deemed unlawful by the tribunal. It said low-interest shareholder loans should not be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that changes made in February to toughen up the regulations also breached competition law.",

        "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nHow did last week's team do?\n\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\n**David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m**\n\n**Gabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m**\n\n**William Saliba, Arsenal, £6m**\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\n**Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\n**Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton**\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\n**Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich**\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\n**Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford**\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\n**Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves**\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\n**Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham**\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\n**Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\n**Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth**\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\n**Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves**\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\n**Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton**\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\n**Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace**\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\n**Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton**\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\n\n**Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)**\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

        "headline": "'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
        "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\n\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\n\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\n\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\n\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\"\n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim can create magic'\n\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\n\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"",

        "article_text": "Manchester United released a seven-minute video on Monday to mark Ruben Amorim's first training session as the club's head coach.\n\nPlayers including Casemiro and Marcus Rashford put out positive posts on their social media accounts to state how well it had gone.\n\nThe editing of a session that would normally last more than an hour gave a few small clues about Amorim's thinking before his first match in charge at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nThere was also a bit of fitness news - and a definite subtle message to try to suggest issues from Erik ten Hag's tenure are now being addressed.\n\nbbc sport's Simon Stone picked out five key themes:\n\nWho was there?\n\nEngland duo Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo, and new signing Leny Yoro, were all involved as they step up their recovery from recent injuries.\n\nShaw has not featured for United since February, Mainoo's last game was at Aston Villa on 6 October and Yoro is still to make his debut since his £52m move from Lille in the summer.\n\nHarry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof were not shown playing any part. All missed international duty this month through injury.\n\nAndre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were all absent on international duty.\n\nFormation & back three?\n\nMuch of the debate around Amorim's appointment has centred around his tactics and how he preferred to operate with three central defenders and two wing-backs at Sporting, an alien concept at United going back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\n\nAmorim said in his interview with club media on Friday fans would see \"an idea\" at Portman Road this weekend. Judging by this footage, a back three will be part of that.\n\nJonny Evans was flanked by Yoro to his right and Shaw to the left. Antony was the right wing-back, Tyrell Malacia the left wing-back.\n\nCasemiro and Mainoo filled the deeper midfield slots, with Mason Mount - who applied a first-time finish to an Antony cross - Amad Diallo and Rashford in the forward roles.\n\n'\"Speed it up\" - Recovery sprints & intensity\n\nOne of the major criticisms of recent United incarnations, going back long before Ten Hag's time, is a lack of work-rate, particularly when it comes to tracking back.\n\nUnited are not saying who signed off the video edit but it seems fairly clear some thought has gone into what was released.\n\nIn possession and attacking, four times, players were shown chasing back hard after Amorim had given the signal for a lost ball and a counter-attack.\n\nIt was repeated so often in such a short space of time, it was as though someone at Old Trafford wanted it to be known Amorim is trying to address United's issues in transition.\n\nMainoo positioning\n\nIn the summer, Mainoo was one of three players - Hojlund and Garnacho being the others - who were ring-fenced as United made it clear they were willing to listen to offers for virtually all their first-team squad.\n\nAs a local boy and academy graduate, Mainoo, 19, is the pin-up boy for how the club wants to be represented.\n\nSo, while it is safe to assume Amorim singled out more than one player for a spot of impromptu coaching, the discussion with Mainoo was the one that made it into the public domain.\n\nAmorim showed Mainoo what he wanted from him in terms of body shape and positioning - and what different options he could have by moving just a short distance.\n\nHead coach not manager\n\nIt is worth remembering Amorim has been appointed as head coach, not a manager, as Ten Hag had been.\n\nIt is Amorim who is guiding players through the patterns he wants to establish.\n\nThere were smiles alongside the messages in the edit of Amorim on Monday. The nearest we saw to ferocity was his demand to \"not lose the ball\" seconds before intervening to tell Evans they had lost possession and needed to regain their position.\n\nIt was insightful to a point. But it was also the picture United wanted the world to see.",

        "headline": "concerns as to the suitability",
        "article_text": "**As Manchester United supporters prepare to welcome a highly-rated and talented coach from outside of Europe's 'big five' leagues who has analysts swooning, they may be worried that it all sounds a bit familiar.** But in Ruben Amorim, they can be certain that in one crucial aspect he won't be anything like Erik ten Hag. The defining complaint about the sacked Dutchman was that after two-and-a-bit seasons the football was still formless and the tactical direction indecipherable. Amorim, who will leave Portuguese champions Sporting to move to Old Trafford next month, is nothing if not a diligent - and decisive - tactical thinker. From a ruthless press to proactive possession football, from a daring high line to a complexly shape-shifting 3-4-3 formation, the hallmarks of Amorim's football will be etched into muscle memory in detailed training sessions. And there will be valid concerns. Most prominent will be how a Manchester United squad built in Ten Hag's image will cope with the change to a back three and a tactical system entirely at odds with what came before. It won't suit everyone. With United posting a £113m net loss for 2023-24, a £15m compensation bill for sacking Ten Hag and paying at least £9m to get Amorim out of Sporting, added to the £200m spent on summer transfers, the Portuguese is not likely to have much budget for January signings. Here's a look at the biggest winners and losers from Amorim's appointment. Amorim is, first and foremost, a flexible tactician. He will sit deep when required and push high when he can; will play neat possession football in some fixtures and tell his players to hit longer diagonals out to the wide men in others. Case in point: Sporting topped the charts in Portugal for both build-up attacks (126) and direct attacks (74) last season. But one thing that doesn't change is the 3-4-3 formation, which is rumoured to be a factor in why Liverpool favoured Arne Slot over Amorim when Jurgen Klopp left this summer. That means Manchester United will revert to a back three for the first time in a decade - since the early days of Louis van Gaal in 2014. Matthijs de Ligt, the marquee summer signing, is the most likely to struggle. He didn't look comfortable when Bayern Munich experimented with a back three under Julian Nagelsmann in 2022-23 and was dropped from van Gaal's Netherlands back three just one game into the 2022 World Cup. Harry Maguire is the only United player used to a back three, and inexperience here is a particular concern given that Amorim's aggressive high line leaves space out wide and in behind. The Premier League is increasingly defined by the sort of fast transitions that could expose this vulnerability, and we saw the downside of Amorim's approach when Manchester City tore through Sporting in a 2022 5-0 Champions League win in Lisbon. Then again, any downside from the switch may be countered by the basic defensive advantage of moving from a four to a five. After all, last season United conceded the second most shots of any team in Europe's 'big five' leagues (667), whereas Sporting, in a compact off-the-ball 5-4-1, conceded the fewest shots in the Primeira Liga (269). The wing-backs play a crucial attacking role in Amorim teams, stretching the play to allow the wingers to drift infield and get tight to the striker. United do not have any natural wing-backs in the squad but if Amorim is to convert a couple he will prioritise the players more comfortable attacking than defending. That's an accurate description of Diogo Dalot, who created 38 chances in the Premier League last season - the third most of any United player - and could be pushed forward. Not that the defensive side isn't important. Dalot has come under fire this season for difficulties defending the back post. For an alternative, Amorim could go maverick, or delve into United's highly rated youth set-up. He has already converted Sporting's tricky 17-year-old winger Geovany Quenda into a wing-back this season. Maybe Amad Diallo, then, will be a surprise rival to Dalot on that side. The man signed to close Ten Hag's infamous donut - the midfield hole that opens up when United's forwards press and defenders backtrack – has previously enjoyed success under Amorim. Ugarte made his name at Sporting, where in 2022-23 he topped the Portuguese charts for tackles and interceptions as the chief destroyer in Amorim's double pivot. He can be the leader on the field; the man already embodying Amorim's tactics and inspiring others to match his intensity. Amorim's wingers, who sit just behind the striker to form a box-shape with the two central midfielders, tend to be direct runners capable of pressing hard and weaving their way through the lines in the transition. In other words, Amorim prefers the polar opposite of the mercurial Bruno Fernandes, a traditional number 10 whose free roaming might not work in such a fine-tuned system. Alejandro Garnacho, on the other hand, could be the perfect fit. He loves to dribble through a crowd, completing 41 progressive carries this campaign, not far off double that of any other United player. Another possible beneficiary is Marcus Rashford, who loves to cut in off the left and run at defenders. In 2022-23, when he scored 30 goals in all competitions, the England forward attempted more dribbles (138) than any other Premier League player bar Bukayo Saka. However, Rashford would need to recapture those 2022-23 levels, with his progressive ball carry figures only at 16 this season. Viktor Gyokeres has been a revelation for Amorim, scoring 41 goals in 42 league games with a mixture of targeted runs, pressing intensity, and power in the penalty area. Amorim moved to a slightly more direct style of football after Gyokeres joined from Coventry City last summer, upping the verticality of his team to get it into the feet of his powerful frontman. That adaptation is instructive. Amorim is more than willing to alter his tactical set-up to suit the strengths and limitations of his players, suggesting that even those players who don't look like an obvious fit could find a manager willing to bend for now... well apart from three at the back.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim will face the media as Manchester United head coach for the very first time at Carrington this afternoon to look ahead to Sunday's trip to Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on November 1, arrived in England on November 11 and started work on the training ground with his players at the beginning of this week.\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon chief, who is keen to install a new identity at Old Trafford, will be itching to make a winning start at Portman Road this weekend and begin the process of turning United's fortunes around.\n\nUnited did not present Amorim to the media at an official unveiling after his arrival in England last week, meaning his pre-match press conference this afternoon will be his first meeting with the British media.\n\nAs a result, he is expected to be quizzed on a wide range of topics, as well as issuing an update on the latest team news and looking ahead to the trip to Portman Road.\n\nAmorim on Mourinho message:\n\n“Jose Mourinho sent me a message. He said it is a big club, with lovely people. It still is. That is correct.”\n\nAmorim: I am the right guy in the right moment:\n\n'Call me naive. But I truly believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the world still will turn, the sun will rise again, I don’t worry about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job.'\n\nAmorim: This is not a revolution:\n\n\"It is not revolution because football is not so different with five players at the back or four or three.\n\nWe have our own ideas. We have our way we see football and we will change the way we play.\"\n\nAmorim: We need to improve a lot to win titles:\n\n\"We have space to grow as a team and we need to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing in the middle of the season with a different way of playing. We need to improve the physical aspect of the team. \n\nI don't know how long it will take but I know we need to win games at Manchester United. I will not tell you we need a lot of time but we need to improve a lot to win titles.\"\n\nAmorim feels United are aligned with his views:\n\n\"I am a dreamer and I believe in myself. I believe in the club and we have the same idea and same mindset.\n\nI think we have room to improve and I want to try new things.\"\n\nAmorim: I feel at home:\n\n\"It's bigger. There's a lot of departments which is different to Sporting. It is a global club with so much to do, not just coaching the team. I have a lot of help and I am very happy and very comfortable. I feel at home.\"\n\nRuben Amorim on his style:\n\n“If you want to speak about the way we play, we lose the ball too often, so we need to keep the ball better. We need to be better running back and I think that’s clear for everybody. We have to be clear in the small details.",

        "article_text": "For Manchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim, today is likely to be the day when the extent of the challenge that lies ahead of him becomes real.\n\nThe Portuguese will face the media for the very first time as United boss ahead of this Sunday's clash with Ipswich Town in the Premier League. Since becoming the new boss, Amorim's media duties have remained either in-house or in front of the Portuguese journalists while still Sporting manager.\n\nHowever, today marks his first press conference in the United Kingdom as the Reds' boss and we can expect the new manager to touch on plenty of topics. As well as previewing his Premier League debut; transfers, future goals and his assessment of the current squad are likely to all be on the agenda too.\n\nWhile Amorim talking to the media is the big talking point of the day, there are other areas to focus on too. The January transfer window is just around the corner and speculation about potential signings is beginning to hot up.\n\nViktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with the Reds however a deal for the Swede is more likely to be completed in the summer than this winter.\n\n### Potential Alphonso Davies blow\n\nReal Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.\n\nOne of the clubs interested in his signature is Real with Football Espana stating the Spanish giants are 'favourites' and are 'confident' on securing his services from next summer onwards. Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, is expected to lose one of the two at the end of the season, though it's said it cannot be ruled out that both end up moving on.\n\n### Amorim is everything Ten Hag wasn't\n\nSpeaking to Casino Hawks, former Premier League midfielder Emmanuel Petit believes that Amorim has that added ingredient which Ten Hag lacked at Old Trafford.\n\nAmorim will stick with his philosophy, his tactics and his style at United, Erik ten Hag was changing tactics in every game. There is something very different about Amorim, he has the passion and the communication, everything Ten Hag was missing. Amorim has shown what he can do when his Sporting side beat Manchester City, that might be a taster of what he can do at United.\n\n### When will Ruben Amorim's press-conference start?\n\nRuben Amorim will speak to the English media for the first time this afternoon since becoming head coach of Manchester United.\n\nHis first duties with the media in this country are scheduled to begin at 2pm. Man United will be showing live coverage of the press conference on their in-house television channel, MUTV.",

Of course, when the weather turns cold, sporting fixtures up and down the UK suddenly go into doubt.\n\nPremier League stadiums these days are equipped with undersoil heating and state-of-the-art frost covers which prevent pitches from freezing when the temperatures drop. However, while the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United do not have to worry about their pitches being up to scratch, there is concern about the surrounding areas.\n\nMatches have been called off in the past should authorities believe that roads and footpaths outside the stadium are too treacherous for supporters to attend. As such, all eyes are on the weather forecasts to see if either Manchester club will be facing another football-free weekend.\n\nCity are first up this weekend with their game taking place at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening. According to the Met Office, today is expected to be a cold one in Manchester with temperatures reaching a maximum of 5C.\n\nIcy conditions are expected on the roads and temperatures could drop to as low as -2C overnight. However, rain is expected while we are tucked up in bed as Storm Bert brings 'a widely unsettled' day.\n\nWhile the rain could be torrential at times for some, it will melt away any remaining snow and ice with temperatures rising to 12C. This should, in theory, mean that City's game will be on.\n\nIn even less doubt this weekend is United's trip to Ipswich Town. Suffolk has not been hit with the same wintery blast as Manchester and as such there should not be any issues at this stage for Ruben Amorim's debut to be postponed.",

        "article_text": "Manchester City midfielder Rodri has given his honest thoughts about Ballon d’Or rival Vinicius Junior - but Neymar is not happy with his comments. Rodri, 28, was awarded the coveted prize on Monday, 28 October, at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. This was after Real Madrid star Vini Jr, 24, had also been tipped to secure the award, which is widely regarded as the award for being the best player in the world. As a result of missing out, the Spanish side did not travel to the French capital for the occasion despite striker Kylian Mbappe sharing the Gerd Muller Trophy with Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane. Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony. Quickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to. They're not ready.\" Rodri has been out of action since sustaining a knee ligament injury in a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on September 22. Now, the Spanish midfielder has finally spoke out about the Ballon d’Or debacle. “I think he’s a smart guy and with time you’ll realize that the more you pay attention on the field, the better he [Vini Jr] will be,\" Rodri told Spanish TV programme El Largeuro. “Athletes are not just what you represent on the field, but also off it.” But it was Vini Jr's Brazil teammate Neymar who could not help but give his thoughts on Rodri's words with a five-word dig in the comment section of Futeousadia's Instagram post. The Al Hilal man commented: \"Virou falador agora (he becomes a talker now - in English).\" Neymar previously referred to the Real Madrid man as a \"great idol\" and \"hero\" for the people of Brazil even explaining how he didn't \"think there's anyone but him [Vini Jr] to win it [Ballon d'Or]\" when speaking to SNTV in October. The former Barcelona man has also never won the Ballon d’Or despite arguably being one of the best players over the last 15 years. In Neymar’s case, he was up against the seemingly unstoppable Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with this year’s nominee list being the only one to not feature one of the pairing since 2003.",

        "headline": "Pep Guardiola makes huge claim about Man City's 115 charges and rival fans won't be happy",
        "article_text": "**Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken out about the club's 115 financial fair play charges just one day after signing a two-year extension on his deal.** After a two week international break, the Premier League is back in action on Saturday with several exciting clashes including a match between defending champions City and Tottenham Hotspur. Just days before the match, City fans were treated to the news that legendary manager Guardiola had signed a new deal with the club, extending his stay there until the summer of 2027. Having signed the new deal, Guardiola has now spoken out again about City's 115 charges regarding breaches of the Premier League's FFP rules, and his comments are not going to sit well with rival fans. At the start of the season, the Catalan manager claimed that he would stand by the club even if they were found guilty of the 115 charges and relegated to a lower tier of the English football ladder. And now, much to the dismay of rivals hoping he would leave City in the near future, he has doubled down on his promise. Speaking ahed of City's clash with Tottenham this weekend, Guardiola said: \"I said six months ago, when all the clubs accused us of doing something wrong, [and was asked] what happened if we are relegated. I will be here. \"Next year, if we are in the Conference we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now. \"I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, 'It's the last year of Pep'. I don't want to be in that position.\" However, the five-time Premier League winner admitted that if results for City turned for the worst, then he would consider leaving the club and pursuing a career elsewhere. \"I would like to stay for the two years but I know if the results are not good it will not be two years,\" added Guardiola. So far in the 2024/25 Premier League season, City have struggled to match the standard set by themselves in previous seasons, as they continue to miss midfield star Rodri who suffered a season-ending injury in September.",

        "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?” by the club’s social media channels when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability”.\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “Kai Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention “striker” qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fan’s claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference.\n\n“The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations.

According to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's.

        "article_text": "**A decision has been reached on APT rule amendments after Manchester City challenged the Premier League.**\n\nIn June City launched unprecedented legal action against the Premier League in a bid to stop Associated Party Transaction rules which were brought in back in 2021.\n\nThe club claimed that previous rules were \"unlawful\" and submitted 165-page legal document ahead of a legal hearing where City achieved some success and were victorious in seven of their key arguments.\n\nIn order for the rules to be updated, 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs needed to be in favour of the proposed changes. However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool. Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three.\n\n“I don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n“Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

But although Amazon still have rights to some Champions League fixtures, they did not bid for the Premier League TV rights which come into effect from the 2025/26 season and lasts until the end of the 2028/29 campaign.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports will share packages after reaching a £6.7billion rights agreement, the biggest in sports history.\n\nTyldesley is booked in for a clash between Brighton and Brentford on 27 December but he has admitted it could well be a final bow for him.\n\n\"What actually could be the final game I ever commentate for UK television is Brighton-Brentford,\" he told the Anfield Wrap podcast.\n\n\"That won't be dull. That's on 27 December. Amazon Prime, this is their final year, so the Premier League going forward is going back to a two-man cartel of Sky and TNT.\"\n\nGoing forward Sky Sports will show a minimum of 215 games live, with TNT slated for 52 matches. Tyldesley still has an existing deal with CBS Sports for Champions League commentary in the United States and does work for Rangers TV.\n\nBack in July, Tyldesley made it clear that he has no intention of hanging up his microphone just yet.\n\n\"All I can do is keeping reviewing my own standards, keep making myself available,\" he said on his podcast.\n\n\"If someone like CBS - who have given me a four-year contract to cover Champions League for the USA - show that sort of confidence in me then I can only assure you I will repay that faith by working bloody hard and trying to be as good as I can be.",

        "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to the Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one touches or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is the big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not typical goal-scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create the space for them.",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.”",

        "headline": "Fabrizio Romano reveals Ruben Amorim’s top transfer priority ahead of January window with two targets named",
        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates on the list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper.

There's footage of me saying that from around a year before it happened, from a reliable source.\"\n\nCo-host Darren Bent did joke that the 'reliable source' was perhaps more reliable than Goldstein's City 'whisper'.\n\nSPORTbible has contacted the Premier League for comment.\n\nBelow, in full, are the 115 charges levelled against Manchester City by the Premier League and UEFA:\n\n*   **Failure to provide accurate and up-to-date financial information from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 54 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations from December 2018-present [February 2023] -** 35 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to provide accurate financial reports for player and manager compensation from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 14 alleged breaches\n*   **Breaches of Premier League profitability and sustainability regulations from 2015/16 to and including 2017/18 -** Seven alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to comply with UEFA's regulations, including UEFA's Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations -** Five alleged breaches",

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

        "headline": "Man Utd 'make contact' with European giants for first January signing as Ruben Amorim stamps his mark",
        "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\" \n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n“If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe,\" \n\nPorro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option.

        "headline": "Man Utd players have already come up with a 'nickname' for Ruben Amorim after first training sessions",
        "article_text": "**Manchester United’s players already have a ‘nickname’ for head coach Ruben Amorim.** Amorim, 39, arrived at the club’s Carrington Training Centre on Monday and was greeted by several members of the Red Devils’ hierarchy – including sporting director Dan Ashworth, CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. On the same day, he took charge of training for the first time, with the Portuguese having just ten senior players available due to the ongoing international break. As a result, several academy players joined in the session. Amad, who is thought to be impressing his new boss, Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo were among the training squad. The former Sporting Club boss faces a tough trip to Portman Road on Sunday, 24 November, where he will take charge of his first game as United boss against Ipswich Town. Fans have been paying close attention to the footage of training ahead of the fixture as they try to piece together his potential starting line-up. The Sun reported that the players have been ‘blown away’ by Amorim’s ‘Mourinho-style’ confidence. “Even before Monday’s first session, the players have been very impressed,” a source explained. “Then, after the sessions, they are blown away by his energy, approach and confidence. “There’s definite Mourinho vibes in the way he speaks and his self-belief - but the style is his own. “The players think he’s very approachable and that he will understand them. Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.” Amorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal. The 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24. Understandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past, the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight. Amorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15. \"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained. “To win time is to win games. “But the most important thing for me is identity. “So, from day one, we will start with our identity. “The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

        "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins and a Champions League - as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nHe also endured a less successful spell as manager of Ipswich Town and has since been part of ITV and Sky Sports’ football coverage.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10’. However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it [the number], no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap. “When I went to [Manchester] United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained. “Then when the number came in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay [with] my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], when Eric [Cantona] left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks [David Beckham]. And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f*****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers, which also included guest Daniele De Rossi, were expecting a more complex answer, with the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder saying: “Invent something, invent something,” while the others laughed along. \n\nThe group were enjoying a meal together in a traditional Italian restaurant in the country’s capital, Rome. De Rossi is a long-time admirer of the Irishman and even credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016. “Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

        "article_text": "**Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.** Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour. Jenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'.\n\nAnd now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband. According to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family. My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy. Now I just want to move forward. Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.”\n\nDespite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future. \"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added. \"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future. He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.”\n\nWhen details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie. He said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault. The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family. There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.” “Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human. When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.”",

        "article_text": "Liverpool fans have made their mind up about Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid after seeing what just appeared in the Spanish capital.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, 26, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be able to start talks with foreign clubs from January 1, 2025.\n\nThe Liverpool man has played an integral part in the club's early season success under new boss Arne Slot - the Reds currently sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, arguably the biggest negative surrounding the club is the contractual situation of Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, and Virgil van Dijk – all three are out of contract at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nAlthough there is no doubting the ability of Van Dijk and Salah, the ages – 33 and 32, respectively – of the players could be a sticking point in contract negotiations.\n\nHowever, with Alexander-Arnold at 26 and arguably approaching his peak, losing him, especially without receiving a transfer fee, would be far from ideal for the Reds.\n\nAlthough the situation is still unclear, Liverpool supporters were shocked when they came across a giant advert of the player in Madrid, posted to X by Anfield Wrap.\n\nThe Liverpool defender was pictured alongside model and actress Iris Law for a shoot for fashion brand 'Guess' on a billboard, which was emblazoned on the side of a building located at Plaza Felipe II – the place where thousands of Liverpool fans gathered ahead of their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final held in the city.\n\nFans were quick to offer their thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOne fan said: “If he goes, he goes, [it] won't go down well with LFC fans if he walks away for nothing. I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus.\n\n“We've always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it.\n\n\"And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool are ‘planning’ a move for an in-form Premier League forward – but they may have to compete with a rival to sign the player.\n\nLiverpool have started the season in excellent fashion, with new manager Arne Slot seeing his side pick up 15 wins in his first 17 games in charge of the Reds.\n\nThe Merseyside-based side also sit top of both the Premier League and the 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of the first challenges faced by Slot when he arrived was the lack of new players coming into the club during the summer transfer window.\n\nJust Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili were recruited, with the Georgian ‘keeper instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nThe Reds tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad ‘number six’ Martin Zubimendi, but so far, Ryan Gravenberch has performed well in the role.\n\nDespite most things currently being positive at the club, the only real negatives are the contractual situations Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk find themselves in – all three are out of contract at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, the club are now ‘weighing’ up a move for the Egyptian's potential replacement, according to The Sun.\n\nLiverpool are thought to be keen on Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, 25, who has been in impressive form, having already netted eight goals in 11 appearances for the Bees this term.\n\nMbeumo is most comfortable playing as a right forward/winger, which happens to be the position Salah takes up in the Liverpool side.\n\nBut Slot’s side may be in for some tough competition to sign the player as Newcastle United have been ‘watching’ the player, who is said to be highly regarded by Magpies’ boss Eddie Howe.\n\nThe report suggests the Tynesiders may be willing to offer Callum Wilson as part of a potential £50m deal, but it is still unclear if talks are underway between either of the clubs.\n\nWhat has Bryan Mbeumo said about a potential transfer?\nBack in May 2024, the France-born Cameroon international admitted he would like to play at the “best clubs”.\n\n“I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone, but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs,\" he said in an interview with L’Equipe.\n\n\"It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me. We will see [about a transfer].\"\n\nThe 25-year-old’s current Brentford contract is set to run until June 2026.",

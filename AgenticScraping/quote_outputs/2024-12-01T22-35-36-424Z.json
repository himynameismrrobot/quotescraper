That victory over the Norwegian side marked the first win of the Amorim era after United could only draw 1-1 with Ipswich in the Portuguese's first game in charge last weekend.\n\nEverton visit Old Trafford having won just twice in the league this season and Sean Dyche's side haven't scored in their last three games.

The striker signed a scholarship with an agreement for his professional contract to begin when he turned 17 after joining United from Arsenal in the summer.\n\n### Casemiro on Amorim\n\nCasemiro has said all of United's players are 'excited' by the recent appointment of Amorim at Old Trafford.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed from Sporting Lisbon earlier this month, oversaw his first victory as United head coach on Thursday night, leading his side to a 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nAfter seeing Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute opener wiped out, United recovered from 2-1 down to clinch their second Europa League win of the campaign.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United could confirm two new first teamers vs Everton - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United take on Everton in the Premier League today and here are five things to look out for at Old Trafford.\n\nManchester United are back at Old Trafford today for the first of nine games in 30 days in December as they look to end a gruelling year on an upbeat note.\n\nUnited got their first win under new head coach Ruben Amorim on Thursday and are seeking their first in the Premier League on the Portuguese's watch against Everton.\n\nCentre backs Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans could all still be unavailable after their absences against Bodo/Glimt three days ago but Amorim has a fullish squad to select from.\n\nWith United and Everton fans scheduled to protest against scandalous ticket price increases before kick-off, it is worth keeping an eye out off the pitch as much as on it.\n\nHere are five things to look out for:\n\n**How many more changes?**\n\nAmorim reiterated again on Thursday night United \"have to rotate the team\". Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\n\nRasmus Hojlund was \"dead\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\n\n**Who will have the ball?**\n\n\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\n\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\n\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\n\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\n\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\n\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\n\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\n\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\n\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\n\n**Amad to cement his place?**\n\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.",

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, Andre Onana is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\n\nAmorim recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\n\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and Amad will be recalled.\n\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. Bruno Fernandes operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\n\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut. Fernandes is likely to operate in one of the No.10 roles, likewise Marcus Rashford, who stepped off the bench in the second half on Thursday.\n\n**United predicted XI vs Everton:** Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Mainoo, Dalot; Fernandes, Hojlund, Rashford.",

        "article_text": "I signed for Manchester United and asked to quit after my first training session - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United completed the signing of Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal in January 2018, but he wanted to leave almost as soon as he had arrived.\n\nBy\nGeorge Smith Senior Football Writer\n\nHaving scored 38 goals since the beginning of the 2016/17 season, excitement levels soared when Manchester United lured Alexis Sanchez to Old Trafford from Arsenal in January 2018.\n\nThe Chilean, who had joined Arsenal from Barcelona in 2014, joined United as part of a deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan move in the other direction. Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\n\nSanchez joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the Premier League. In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\n\n\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\n\n\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with Jose Mourinho was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\"\n\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 FA Cup semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from Manchester City prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\n\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\n\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\n\n\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\n\n\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\"\n\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\n\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by Chelsea at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\n\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\n\n\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\" he said. \"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\n\n\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\"\n\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\n\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.",

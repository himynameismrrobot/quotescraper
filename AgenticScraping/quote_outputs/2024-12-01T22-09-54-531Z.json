Man Utd 'far from perfect' in win over Everton - Amorim. Video, 00:03:23, published at 16:24\n*   Attribution\n        \n        Premier League\n        \n    \n4.  Manchester United's win over Everton at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim is the biggest margin of victory for a permanent manager in their first home match in the competition for the club.\n    \n    Marcus Rashford has now scored in back-to-back Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim (three goals), as many goals as he managed in his previous 23 matches under both Ruud van Nistelrooy and Erik ten Hag.\n    \n6.  Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been talking to BBC Match of the Day after the win: \"It was far from a perfect performance. We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes, Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second balls.\n    \n    \"I felt that the players could solve some problems that we had as a team because of the quality that they have, but it was far from a perfect performance. But it was a really good result and a tough match.\"\n    \n    **On their opening goal:** \"You have to congratulate the players and the rest of the staff. The most important thing on set-pieces is the staff, so great job.\n    \n    \"You can see how tall they are and how small we are as a team, so we tried to see where we would have space to create danger.\"\n    \n    **On Amad Diallo:** \"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he also has to improve. He is in a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he is helping me.\"\n    \n    **On the mood becoming more buoyant and optimistic:** \"It helps to have a new face, it always helps. We have to be very clear to our fans and this will always help.\n    \n    \"Rather than trying to convince the fans about this performance, it is better to say we have a lot to do, it will take time. Sometimes we are not playing well but everyone defended together.\n    \n    \"Our fans just ask for hard work and then, in time, they will ask for better football.\"\n    \n7.  Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has been talking to Sky Sports following the victory: \"It is a nice result. It is important with a new coach and a new way of playing, when we are still learning. We have to back up this performance and win midweek.\n    \n    \"We all, as individuals, want to get back to our best and then push to improve so, even in the bad moments, you are doing the right thing.\n    \n    \"The connection is going to build and grow the more we get used to him. He has come in a busy period and hopefully the connection keeps building and growing. He has come in with a great attitude and it has passed onto the players.\n    \n    \"The atmosphere is one of the most special things about his club, and playing at this great stadium is always a great feeling.\n    \n    \"It is early on but I feel energised and ready for the next game. This game has only just finished, but the next one is always the focus for the players.\"\n    \n8.  Ruben Amorim has become the latest manager to be tasked with restoring Manchester United's on-pitch fortunes.\n    \n    The club paid £11m to Portuguese club Sporting to recruit the 39-year-old and his staff, making him the sixth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year reign ended with his retirement in 2013.\n    \n    After a draw at Ipswich and a win against Bodo/Glimt in his first two games, his side host Everton on Sunday (13:30 GMT).\n    \n    BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman caught up with the Portuguese manager on Football Focus, firstly asking him if he is already feeling a connection with the Manchester United fans.\n    \n    \"Yes for sure, I feel that,\" Amorim revealed. \"Maybe because I'm a little bit of an emotional person. I can transmit that, even in interviews, I think.\n    \n    \"Maybe because I am different from the last coach and this can bring a different connection with the next guy.\n    \n    \"I believe that I am the right guy. People always believe the next guy is the right guy. We always have this feeling.\n    \n    \"To maintain this feeling, we have to play better and win games and be really honest with the supporters.\n    \n    \"If you are honest and direct with the supporters - maybe you don't always say the popular thing - you can create a better connection.\"\n    \n    **On the game:** \"Like a real ride. We started well, but then suffered two goals in two transitions. I like the way the players tried to play our game.\n    \n    \"Sometimes we won the ball and have had problems in the past giving the ball away too much - the mindset is keeping the ball.\n    \n    \"They are really trying and I think we deserved the win.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United player ratings as Amad brilliant vs Everton - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United battered Everton 4-0 in the Premier League to rise to the top half of the table and here are how the players rated at Old Trafford.\n\nMarcus Rashford gave United the lead as his half-volley found the back of the net after a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite. Joshua Zirkzee struck before half time to put United 2-0 up.\n\nRashford grabbed his second to end the game as a contest shortly after the break and Zirkzee then joined him on two goals for the afternoon to make it 4-0.\n\nHere are how the players rated at Old Trafford:\n\n**Andre Onana**\n\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\n\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\n\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\n\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\n\n**Amad**\n\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\n\n**Casemiro**\n\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\n\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\n\n**Diogo Dalot**\n\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\n\n**Bruno Fernandes**\n\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford**\n\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\n\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\n\n**Subs**\n\n**Luke Shaw**\n\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\n\n**Harry Maguire**\n\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\n\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte**\n\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\n\n**Mason Mount**\n\nLast to come on. 6\n\n**Manager**\n\nRotated heavily again and it seemed to count against United until the opening goal on 34 minutes. An intense presence on the touchline, he kept the players on their toes and made sensible substitutions. 7",

        "article_headline": "LUCKHURST: Amad responds perfectly to Ruben Amorim's touchline reactions in Manchester United win",
        "article_text": "Man United secured a first four-goal victory in the Premier League in Ruben Amorim's first league match in charge at Old Trafford.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite did not get his move to Manchester United in the summer yet he stepped up as their 12th man against Everton.\n\nA deflection and a dozy pass from the centre-back gifted United both of their first-half goals to turn the game on its head. Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\n\nUnited were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\n\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \"Amorim's Red and White Army\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\n\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\n\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\n\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \"Five Cantonas\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\n\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\n\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\n\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \"Olé\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\n\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\n\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\n\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\n\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\n\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\n\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\n\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\n\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\n\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\n\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United recorded their biggest Premier League win of the season by beating Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee, who started together for the first time under Ruben Amorim, helped themself to a brace each to put Everton to the sword and elevate United up into the top half of the Premier League table.\n\nRashford gave United a 34th-minute lead, firing a deflected effort past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, before Zirkzee scored his first goal since the opening weekend of the season seven minutes later.\n\nUnited put the game beyond doubt less than 30 seconds into the second half when Rashford claimed his second, firing past Pickford after being slipped in by the lively Amad.\n\nAmad then created United's fourth goal that was turned in by Zirkzee for his second goal of the afternoon.\n\nThe only negative for United was that they lost both Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo to suspension. They were both yellow carded in the second half, each collecting their fifth booking of the season in the process.\n\n**You can recap how Sunday afternoon's game unfolded by scanning through our blog below...**\n\nKey Events\n----------\n\n*   15:44 - REPORT: Amad responds perfectly to Amorim's touchline reactions in United win.\n*   15:28 - PLAYER RATINGS: Amad brilliant as United put Everton to the sword.\n*   15:22 - FULL-TIME: MUN 4-0 EFC - A big win for United.\n*   14:53 - 64' - MUN 4-0 EFC - GOAL UNITED! 4-0 (Zirkzee).\n*   14:35 - 46' - MUN 3-0 EFC - GOAL UNITED! 3-0 (Rashford).\n\n16:45 George Smith:\n\n### That's a wrap\n\nWe're calling time on today's live coverage from Old Trafford here, folks.\n\nThank you ever so much for following our live blog today.\n\n### REPORT: Amad responds perfectly to Amorim's touchline reactions in United win\n\nJarrad Branthwaite did not get his move to United in the summer yet he stepped up as their 12th man against Everton.\n\nA deflection and a dozy pass from the centre back gifted United both of their first-half goals to turn the game on its head. Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\n\nUnited were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\n\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \"Amorim's Red and White Army\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim makes Marcus Rashford claim after Manchester United win - Manchester Evening News\n\nMarcus Rashford scored twice in Man Utd's comfortable win over Everton and Ruben Amorim was asked about his display.\n\nBy\n\nSteven Railston Manchester United Writer\n\nRashford scored a brace.\n\nRuben Amorim agreed Marcus Rashford showed \"he wanted it\" by scoring a brace in Manchester United's dominant 4-0 victory over Everton on Sunday.\n\nAmorim said when asked about Rashford at his press conference last week: \"We'll try to find the right solution for him but he has to be Marcus, first of all, to try to return to that moment.\"\n\nHe added that Rashford \"has to be the first one to want it\" and the United academy graduate responded to that challenge by scoring an impressive brace against Everton.\n\nRashford scored the first goal of Amorim's tenure when finding the net after just 81 seconds against Ipswich Town at Portman Road and now has seven goals in all competitions.\n\nAmorim was asked whether Rashford's performance against Everton was an example of him \"wanting it\" and responded: \"Yeah, yeah... he can do so much. He has to continue to improve.\n\n\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\"\n\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\" he said.\n\n\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\"\n\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a Manchester United coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\" said Amorim about potential Champions League qualification.\n\n\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results. We’ll see in the end. I’ve said this many times, I will be judged on where we finish, I know that, but let’s focus on the next game and look at the performance.\n\n\"On Thursday, it was a 3-2 and I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 but I thought Everton deserved more. Let’s focus on the performance, congratulations to the lads, let’s rest, recover and think about Arsenal.\"",

The game was suspended after 25 minutes with Bove stretchered off and taken to hospital.\n\nDe Gea, who joined the Italian side over the summer and has played 10 times in Serie A alongside Bove, started the game. He was among those who were extremely worried on the field after Bove fell to the ground.\n\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \"God Please (prayer hands emoji)\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\n\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\n\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\n\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from Old Trafford.\n\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \"Come on Edo. We are with you!\"\n\nFellow ex-Manchester United star Paul Pogba was among others to offer their support. \"Forza @edo_bove [prayer hands emoji]\" he wrote on his Instagram story with a blank background. Former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli did the same. He wrote: \"@edo_bove Prego di rivederti così al più presto Ti abbraccio forte [bicep emoji]\", which translates as, \"I pray to see you again as soon as possible I hug you tightly.\"\n\nRomelu Lukaku and Tammy Abraham, who were both at Roma last season but now play at Napoli and AC Milan respectively, have also posted to their Instagram stories for Bove.\n\nBove has played 11 league games for La Viola this season, winning the last seven he has started alongside De Gea. The pair have only failed to win twice when playing together, only one was a defeat.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United recorded back-to-back victories with a thumping 4-0 win over Everton in the Premier League.\n\nManchester United stars Kobbie Mainoo and Leny Yoro have hailed the impact of Amad after he grabbed two assists in the 4-0 victory over Everton.\n\nThe Reds returned to Old Trafford after an unconvincing win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League, but United were a lot closer to what Ruben Amorim is wanting on Sunday afternoon. Marcus Rashford opened the scoring with a deflected effort before Joshua Zirkzee scored after the ball was initially won back well by Amad.\n\nUnited made it three with Rashford's second of the game as the Ivorian laid the ball through for him and the game was wrapped up by Zirkzee just after the hour mark as Amad once again won possession high up the pitch before setting up the Dutchman for his brace.\n\nIt was a performance from Amad that many United fans have come to expect after becoming a key player quickly under Amorim. After the match, United's official Instagram posted a picture of the winger with the caption: \"Unplayable.\"\n\nThis was quickly shared on Mainoo's story and liked by Yoro as they sent a clear verdict on the youngster's performance. Amad's brace of assists made it four in just three Premier League matches for United.\n\nSince Amorim arrived, Amad has been asked to play a wing-back role, one which he has taken to comfortably. During much of Erik ten Hag's reign, Antony was chosen ahead of the 22-year-old much to the bemusement of supporters.\n\nHowever, the winger is now one of the first names on the teamsheet. Next up for Amad and his United teammates is a trip to Arsenal in midweek in the Premier League.",

        "article_text": "'Bitter and resentful' ticket hikes slammed as Man United, Man City and Liverpool unite - Manchester Evening News\n\nSupporters from Manchester City, Man United, Everton and Liverpool came together to protest ticket hikes\n\nThe price increases from Premier League clubs has been described as 'death by a thousand cuts' with Manchester City Fans Supporting Foodbanks' Nick Clarke expressing his hope for change within English football.\n\nFans from both Liverpool and Manchester joined forces on Sunday to protest against ticket price increases. Manchester United and Everton were together in arms prior to United's 4-0 win in a demonstration against hikes amid recent changes from the Old Trafford hierarchy which will see new tickets for children and older fans rise to £66.\n\nAt Anfield, fans displayed a 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty' and 'Unity is Strength' banners outside of the Kop against the soaring yearly costs. Clarke said: \"Tribalism ultimately holds back supporters across the country, who all experience the same issues to getting things done from protecting the game, as we know and knew it.\n\n\"Spirit of Shankly reached out to us, we looked at the fixture list and United were playing Everton at home on the same day, the four biggest clubs in the north west, all together. We reached out to United fans, for me as a City fan, all the hatred and bitterness that exists between our two clubs, to reach out to United was a tough thing to do but the 1958 group were absolutely fantastic.\n\n\"They understand we can hate each other in the stand to an extent but we will not get anything done outside of it. I want to be there in the same stands in 20 years slagging them off, I want my sons, daughters, nieces and nephews to also be there - it doesn't seem possible with the way football is going now.\n\n\"During a time where fans feel downbeat and depressed, it's not like a one off issue, Villa putting the prices up for Champions League tickets but at City, we've experienced 12 out of 14 seasons price increases - it's death by a thousand cuts, that's what hurts, it's bitter and resentful. It affects us over years, now I've never felt like this before, speaking to Liverpool and United fans, the way we are now I feel so hopeful.\n\n\"English football needs to change, this (protesting) is how we'll change it through the fans - who people say are the lifeblood of the game but none of them act like it.\"\n\nSpirit of Shankly's Gareth Roberts added: \"Man City have been one of our huge rivals on the pitch in recent years and we thought it sent a really strong message to come together today before a huge game and say we've had enough. Because we have had enough - Liverpool fans have, City fans have, United fans, Everton fans have, fans across the league feel they've been squeezed too much now.\n\n\"We've been squeezed for 30 years, let's be honest, I want to send a message, we all want to send a message to the clubs to stop putting the prices up, stop exploiting our loyalty and it's at every turn.\n\n\"Manchester United this week, £66 tickets, one minute it's £25 for an under-16, next it's £66, clearly not acceptable but clearly an example of boardrooms that don't really seem to care about the fans so we're saying, 'you should care'.\n\n\"Where will that lead? That will lead, I think, to a 'product' where you've got people coming, tick it off the bucket list, watch a game, look at the famous Kop and wonder why it's not that noisy and not that passionate anymore then go home and say, 'well, it's not what I heard it was'.\n\n\"Why isn't it? Because you price people out. All we're saying is keep the game affordable, there's £12.25billion coming into the Premier League in TV money over the next three years, that sounds like enough where you don't have to keep putting your hands out to fans.\"",

We feel we can get a lot stronger in this system.\n\n\"Also, we've not played this system before and nobody knows what to expect from us. It puts us in a good position because we have got so many personnel and different players that can play in different positions.\n\n\"We can change a lot in games and set up differently for different games, so like I have said, it is exciting. I don't want to get too carried away, but like I have said earlier, the energy and the atmosphere is what we want from Old Trafford.\"\n\nRashford opened the scoring at Old Trafford, connecting with a Bruno Fernandes corner after arriving late inside the penalty area. It was a tactic United worked on during training on Saturday.\n\n\"For me, the first one is something that we deliberately worked on just yesterday,\" Rashford added. \"When you don't have many days between games, you work on these things to try and catch teams off their guard, because a lot of teams' set-ups are good.\n\n\"We need to find these little things, and it is not going to happen every game, but as long as the intent is there and we believe that we're going to score and we try, at the end of the game we can't complain about anything.\"",

Amorim has yet to get off the mark in the Premier League, after drawing 1-1 with Ipswich in his first outing.\n\nThe busy winter period looms, and there is likely to be plenty of rotation - both for tired legs, and for settling into Amorim's preferred 3-4-3 formation. Goalkeeper Andre Onana will keep his nailed-on Premier League position, but who else should feature?\n\nReader Jungle Jerry writes: “I would play Shaw at LWB and Dalot at RWB. Rest Fernandes. Play Amad and Mount behind Højlund. Mazraoui, De Ligt, and Martinez keep their places in the backline, with Ugarte and Mainoo in midfield. More natural positions for players and more energy.”\n\nCommenter Tankjr would try something different, replying: “If playing a less physical team with less counter-attacking pace, or using a different formation that would seem like a really good starting 11, assuming we could handle resting captain fantastic, ever.\n\n\"But for Everton I would stick Dalot at RWB, with Malacia in the LWB position, drop Shaw in behind as the dedicated Left CB, Maguire at CB, stick with Mazroui at Right RB. Play De Ligt as a sweeper DMF in front of the back three, then Ugarte or Mainoo as a DMF/CMF level with the wingback midfield line. Bruno at AMF, Mount as Split Striker and Hojlund up top as the CF, to offset being too short and lightweight with the six attackers.”\n\nBen123456 says: ”Would rather see Bruno continuing to play the deeper role alongside Ugarte. Then you have someone destructive (Ugarte) to break up play and someone that can start attacks and pass FORWARD (Bruno). Also would then mean you play 2 from 3 of Mainoo, Mount and Garnacho playing off Hojlund. Mainoo’s greatest strengths are his ability to receive the ball in tight spaces, close control and dribbling. Amad to continue as the more attacking of the two wingbacks, and with Mazraoui behind him, you have a RCB who is comfortable drifting wider in coverage.\n\n\"LWB is still a problem as Dalot tends to want to drift inside, Malacia looked leggy in the week (to be expected given how long he’s been out), and Shaw may be technically the best option his durability as a LB has been terrible. LWB definitely the first area to prioritise when it comes to transfers, followed by a pacy CB as our current CBs don’t have a lot of pace. (Evans and Lindelof almost certainly gone in the summer and arguably Maguire could well be to for the same reason - he’s SLOW).”\n\nBruno Fernandes' continued inclusion remains a talking point for some. Reader Rubes1177 writes: “As good as Fernandes is at times, I think overall he is going to hold this team back playing this formation. He is too much of a luxury player. We need someone more athletic and strong in the press to fill the position behind the striker and I'm afraid he is not disciplined enough in the deeper roles. Sell him to someone like Barca where I'm sure he will thrive in a slower paced league.”\n\nZaynaldin says: “120% agree with you man... Rest Bruno for a few games and we'll see. Let Kobbie or Amad take his place.”\n\n**Have your say! Who's safe in this Manchester United team? Who has to prove a point to the new manager?**",

        "article_text": "Erik ten Hag's Man United signing before brutal sacking given green light as true stance emerges - Manchester Evening News\nErik ten Hag was given the green light to sign one of his former players in the summer and the Manchester United board have been impressed.\nBy Matty Hewitt\n*   16:30, 30 NOV 2024\nIt's fair to say Erik ten Hag's signings at Manchester United struggled to make a major impact at Old Trafford. That was until the arrival of Noussair Mazraoui earlier this summer.\nThe Moroccan international has been one of the standout performers from a disappointing campaign for the Reds after joining the club from Bayern Munich earlier this summer. The 27-year-old, who worked with Ten Hag during their time at Ajax, signed a four-year deal and has been an ever present so far this season.\nSigning for a reported initial fee of for an initial fee of £12.8m, that transfer fee now looks like a steal after impressing in his first few months at United. Mazraoui has impressed that much, he's viewed internally as the best signing the club have made in recent years.\nThat's according to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg, who claim the Reds 'board and coaching staff are extremely satisfied with his performances.'\nHe tweeted: \"Noussair #Mazraoui is internally regarded as one of the strongest signings of recent years at @ManUtd. Both the board and the coaching staff are extremely satisfied with his performances. He is seen as an absolute leader and is expected to continue in this role under Ruben #Amorim in the future. Contract until 2028.\"\nIt's very difficult to argue otherwise. The defender has made 19 appearances in all competitions with two assists to his name and is already justifying the transfer fee paid earlier this summer.\nOn the other hand, it's perhaps indicative of United's recent luck in the transfer window that the defender is viewed as one of the best signings in recent seasons, with the Reds struggling in the bottom half of the table.\nAmorim will hope Mazraoui's form continues and is able to help United break into the top-half of the table and push on towards the European places.",

Everton had no response, and it was former transfer target Jarrad Branthwaite who ended up gifting some of those goals to United.\n\nAmad Diallo took full advantage of his chance to impress too, matching Bruno Fernandes' contribution of two assists. It was an ideal way for Amorim to end his first home game in charge of United, and there are visible signs that his coaching is starting to bear fruit.\n\nThe result lifts Manchester United into 9th place in the Premier League, and returns the team to having a positive goal difference in the competition.\n\nFans have only got kind words for one man on the pitch today. Reader Jnkem says: \"Amad is very dangerous! Ten Hag did him wrong by favoring Antony!\" Evillah agrees: \"Amad you beauty!\"\n\nCommenter Noronny writes: \"Amad is undroppable. Man of the match. He's got skill, energy, he's unselfish. Mazraoui is undroppable as well. Every other position is up for grabs.\"\n\nRed Devil says: \"Amorim has got them at it with good substitutions, nobody is safe, he's testing them out. Amad looking to be a really good prospect if he keeps grounded! Excellent young player, keep it up.\"\n\n1968red reckons we're getting a glimpse of what United should've been this season: \"Zirkzee with goals, Amad with 2 assists, and Rashford 2 goals. Where have this Zirkzee and this Rashford been hiding all this time?!\n\n\"We're winning again. Makes you wonder where we'd be if we had Amorim from the start, and Ratcliffe hadn't dithered about by giving Ten Hag more time. Amad is flourishing now when Ten Hag hardly gave him a look in over Antony. Even Zirkzee and Rashford have made positive steps today.\"\n\nGlazerclowns writes: \"This is promising. Zirkzee has his goals which will hopefully kickstart his career.\"\n\nGaryfoxtrot has one complaint: \"I know it was Everton, but some good intent on display, and good to be in positive GD. Hate the back and forth passing sideways at the back, we been done in by better teams for that. Job done Utd.\" Denislawking agrees: \"I hate the walking pace from the back and the constant sideways passing. Modern game I guess.\"\n\nDravic says: \"Well Amorin did say he wanted to get our strikers scoring, job done so far!\"\n\n**Have your say! Who is making themselves key to Amorim's Manchester United so far? Has anyone impressed that you didn't expect?**",

However, a new report by the Mirror suggests Juventus are eyeing the forward as a replacement for Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nThe Italian giants are said to be keen to tie Vlahovic to a new deal but talks over an extension have failed to bear fruit. As a result, that has forced them to look at potential alternatives and Delap is said to fit the profile the club are looking for.\n\nThe report claims Juve are drawing up contingency plans in case an agreement cannot be reached. So much so that they have already watched Delap in action for Ipswich at Portman Road this campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, United and Chelsea are also monitoring his progress. But it's City who have an advantage over other clubs after negotiating a 20 per cent sell-on clause with Ipswich.\n\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna has refused to speak over Delap's future. He said: \"It's not anything I'm aware of or interested in to be honest. I think that's a question for other people and for chairman Mark Ashton.\n\n\"My full focus is on this season and, with regards to Liam, trying to help him to continue to improve. I know Liam's full focus is here and trying to help the team. He's had a good start to the season, but we have to remember that's it's very early stages for him.\n\n\"This is really his first season starting regularly as a number nine. He played off the side a lot of times last year at Hull, played as a wide striker in some earlier Championship loan moves. So this is his first season doing it week-in, week-out, maybe doing it two times a week, and he's doing it at Premier League level. It's positive that he's doing well, but it's really early days. His focus, my focus, our focus is to keep trying to improve.\"\n\nDelap scored a goal and provided an assist as Ipswich recorded a 2-1 win away at Tottenham Hotspur. The win in North London was Ipswich's first victory in the top flight this season since their promotion from the Championship. He also put in a fine performance in the 1-1 draw with United at Portman Road last month.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United could confirm two new first teamers vs Everton - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United take on Everton in the Premier League today and here are five things to look out for at Old Trafford.\n\nManchester United are back at Old Trafford today for the first of nine games in 30 days in December as they look to end a gruelling year on an upbeat note.\n\nUnited got their first win under new head coach Ruben Amorim on Thursday and are seeking their first in the Premier League on the Portuguese's watch against Everton.\n\nCentre backs Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans could all still be unavailable after their absences against Bodo/Glimt three days ago but Amorim has a fullish squad to select from.\n\nWith United and Everton fans scheduled to protest against scandalous ticket price increases before kick-off, it is worth keeping an eye out off the pitch as much as on it.\n\nHere are five things to look out for:\n\n**How many more changes?**\n\nAmorim reiterated again on Thursday night United \"have to rotate the team\". Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\n\nRasmus Hojlund was \"dead\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\n\n**Who will have the ball?**\n\n\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\n\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\n\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\n\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\n\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\n\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\n\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\n\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\n\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\n\n**Amad to cement his place?**\n\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.",

        "article_text": "Man United's Geovany Quenda transfer plan is insight into Ineos and Dan Ashworth blueprint - Matty Hewitt - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United have been linked with a move for upcoming Sporting star Geovany Quenda.\n\nBy Matty Hewitt * 15:30, 30 NOV 2024 \n\nRuben Amorim becoming Manchester United head coach was the first major managerial appointment Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have had to make since becoming minority shareholders at the club.\n\nThe Portuguese head coach is unbeaten in his first two games in charge of the Reds, drawing his first Premier League clash with Ipswich Town before coming from behind to beat Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League in midweek. The United boss has already called for patience as he looks to implement his ideas with the Reds in a new look 3-4-2-1 formation.\n\nAmorim has made the decision to split his coaching staff into groups in an attempt to fast track his ideas across the the players. There's not much the new boss can do in terms of changing personnel given the transfer window is shut until New Year's Day, but we're already hearing murmurings about potential additions to the United squad.\n\nUnited have met with the representatives of Sporting's rising star Geovany Quenda - a player Amorim knows well from his time at the Portuguese club. That being said, he's a player the Reds have been tracking since before Amorim's arrival.\n\nIt's yet another indication as to the direction Ineos and Dan Ashworth want to take the club, having overseen their first transfer window at the club this summer. However, we didn't necessarily see a huge change in tact from previous windows given Erik ten Hag's desire to work with former players.\n\nUnited signed Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt as per Ten Hag's wishes, but there was one signing that offered a huge insight into the direction the club wants to go in. Leny Yoro may have endured a disappointing start to life at United through injuries, but the young French defender is one of the most exciting prospects in European football, linked with Real Madrid prior to his move to United.\n\nQuenda is a player of a similar profile, albeit unlike Yoro, was largely unheard until the last few months. United sporting director Dan Ashworth built an impressive profile of signings during his time as Brighton director, before moving on to Newcastle United.\n\nThe now-Reds chief didn't necessarily work much magic at St, James' Park given the length of his tenure in the North East, but we're already starting to see his influence at Old Trafford. Brighton excelled in signing players with huge potential, for very little value before generating huge transfer profits.\n\nAt United, the model is different, but the underlying ethos remains the same. Quenda has only made 20 senior appearances for Sporting having been named in their matchday squad for the first time by none other than Amorim.\n\nHe became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League. It's clear the youngster has huge potential but offers a huge insight into the profile of players United are now targeting.\n\nHowever, there is the warning from Amorim that he won't raid his former club for players in January, hinting that a move for Quenda will likely be a summer switch.",

        "article_headline": "Manchester United warned about 'tough' Viktor Gyokeres transfer amid clear Sir Jim Ratcliffe stance",
        "article_text": "Manchester United warned about 'tough' Viktor Gyokeres transfer amid clear Sir Jim Ratcliffe stance - Manchester Evening News  \n\nThe Sporting CP striker remains on the radar of Manchester United with Ruben Amorim a known admirer of the Swede\n\nManchester United have been cautioned about a 'tough negotiation' for Viktor Gyokeres, a move that could potentially rankle Sir Jim Ratcliffe and play into the hands of another club.\n\nGyokeres is said to be eager for a reunion with his former Sporting Clube de Portugal manager Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. Since his transfer from Coventry City in 2023, the forward has had an exceptional run in Portugal, propelling Sporting to Primeira Liga glory last season and netting 24 goals already this campaign.\n\nIt's thought that Gyokeres is looking to join Amorim at United, possibly in January or next summer. However, United's top brass have been alerted to expect 'tough negotiations' with Sporting by Coventry owner Doug King, who orchestrated Gyokeres' switch to Sporting just over twelve months ago.\n\nDiscussing the complexities of the deal, King disclosed to talkSPORT that if the striker moves on, it would not only profit Coventry but also Brighton, where Gyokeres played for three years, due to a sell-on fee arrangement. \"That was a tough negotiation with Sporting Lisbon,\" King revealed.\n\n\"If he does get moved on to another chapter in his career, then we'll benefit, but I'm not holding my breath. We're not running the club on that basis [but] we'll take it when and if it comes. But realise as well that a large part of anything that comes our way heads down to his original club at Brighton.\n\n\"Everybody seems to think it goes straight into the coffers, but these sell-ons accumulate down the chain, so you need to be bringing them up from your academy, hopefully, to get the full 100 per cent, but a lot of it still goes down the chain.\"\n\nGiven that at least two of Gyokeres' former clubs are due some of the fee Sporting receive for the Swede, the Portuguese champions will be keen to maximise their profit. It is claimed that Gyokeres has a release clause to the tune of £83million (€100m).\n\nIf Sporting do ensure any interested party matches that price tag, it could leave United co-owner Ratcliffe upset. The INEOS billionaire has previously insisted that he will not be forced into over-paying for targets.\n\nUnited pulled out of a move for Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite during the summer over the asking price, signing Leny Yoro from Lille, instead. Answering a question specifically about Kylian Mbappe on the Geraint Thomas Cycling podcast last year, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players.\"\n\n\"I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success. It's not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Bellingham or next Roy Keane.\"\n\nUnited might therefore have a challenging negotiation ahead as they aim to reduce the fee for Gyokeres.",

        "article_text": "Man United eye £69m Victor Osimhen swap as January transfer 'targeted' - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United are thought to be on the hunt for a centre-forward following Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford.\n\nBy Jack Flintham Sport Central Audience Writer\n\n* 05:00, 1 DEC 2024\n\nManchester United are reportedly open to the idea of swapping new signing Joshua Zirkzee for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen in the January transfer window.\n\nZirkzee has struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League since signing from Bologna in the summer. MEN Sport understands there are some doubts inside United that the Dutchman may not have what it takes to be a regular fixture in the Reds' squad.\n\nAs such, rumours have circulated suggesting a return to Italy is a possibility for the forward. With United looking to bolster their attack, the latest name to be linked with the Reds is Osimhen.\n\nThe Nigerian was previously a target under Erik ten Hag but United were unable to afford him at the time. However, a move never materialised in the summer and Osimhen was shipped out on loan to Galatasaray for this season.\n\nIt is believed a break clause was included in the loan to allow Osimhen to join one of ten top European clubs. It is unclear whether United are one of them.\n\nAccording to Area Napoli, United are looking to kill two birds with one stone by organising a swap deal with the Naples club. United are thought to be ready to offer £33.2m plus Zirkzee for the talented striker - taking the value of the swap to around £69m.\n\nSince moving to Turkey, Osimhen has bagged eight goals across 11 appearances. Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven's attacking midfielder Malik Tillman is also thought to be on United's wishlist for January.\n\nThe attacking midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie this season with eight goals and four assists to his name in 19 appearances. However, the former Bayern Munich man's form has not gone unnoticed in the Premier League.\n\nWhile United are believed to be interested, Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa are also thought to be keen. Tillman is believed to favour a move to the Premier League but the Reds would need to splash as much as £33m to bag him this winter.",

He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\"\n\nAmad continued his superb run of form against Everton on Sunday as he notched two assists.\n\nAnd after impressing once more at Old Trafford, plenty of fans brought up Erik ten Hag and his decision to use the Ivorian sparingly throughout his reign as manager.\n\nIn fact, Ten Hag's decision to use Antony over Amad as they searched for a winner against Fenerbache in October was mentioned by many on social media.\n\nOne said: \"The fact ETH watched him every day in training and continued to play Antony over him blows my mind. What a player we have in Amad,\" while another commented: \"Not sure I’ll ever forgive Erik Ten Hag for his treatment of Amad Diallo.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"Bizarre that it took more than four months for Amad to get a start last season. Even more bizarre that Omari Forson once started ahead of him. He's torn Everton to shreds today. Perfect profile of player for Amorim in this formation.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"Erik ten Hag should be hired just so he can be fired again. Why on God’s green earth did he not platform Amad?!\" and a fifth added: \"Amad is the best pressing player we have by a million miles, and Ten Hag, who wanted to play pressing football, barely used him.\"\n\nAfter that match against Fenerbache in the Champions League, Ten Hag explained his decision.\n\n\"Amad, he is doing well,\" he said. \"But I must also reward the performances of Antony in training. He is a threat almost every training session, so I felt in that moment the right thing to do was bring him on to decide the game.\"\n\nAmad was eventually brought on after Antony picked up an injury in the latter stages but the change was deemed too late for many supporters.\n\nThoughts on Amad's form of late?

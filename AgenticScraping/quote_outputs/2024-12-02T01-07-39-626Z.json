        "article_text": "Man Utd 4-0 Everton: Has Ruben Amorim brought back feel-good factor? - BBC Sport\n\n![Image 1: Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/5906/live/990680c0-b005-11ef-a88f-9db5c484bac5.jpg)Image source, Getty Images\n\nImage caption,\n\nManchester United are unbeaten in three games under new boss Ruben Amorim\n\n[Shamoon Hafez](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/clmm2zp829jt)\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter at Old Trafford\n\n*   Published\n    \n    6 hours ago\n    \n\n**\"Ruben Amorim's red and white army\" was the chant that filled the air at full-time on Sunday, as the jeers turned to cheers at Old Trafford.**\n\nThe Portuguese manager took the acclaim of supporters in the Stretford End after overseeing his Manchester United side's [4-0 thrashing](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ckglqgrwgx0t) of lowly Everton.\n\nThe atmosphere around the ground was in stark contrast to occasions this season when the side have been booed by supporters, particularly after 3-0 thumpings on their own turf by Liverpool and Tottenham.\n\nDefeat at West Ham on 27 October proved to be the final game for Erik ten Hag, sacked a day later, with the side languishing in 14th place and seven points adrift of the top four.\n\nBut there has been a remarkable turnaround in results and form since the Dutchman's dismissal, with interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy and now Amorim steering the side on a run of seven unbeaten games.\n\nSo after numerous false dawns, is the feel-good factor finally returning to the Theatre of Dreams?\n\n\"It helps to have a new face, it always helps,\" boss Amorim told BBC Match of the Day. \"We have to be very clear to our fans and this will always help.\n\n\"Rather than trying to convince the fans about this performance, we have a lot to do - it will take time. Sometimes we are not playing well but we defended together.\n\n\"Our fans just ask for hard work and then in time they will ask for better football.\"\n\nWin 'nothing to get overly excited by'\n\nDespite lifting the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, the Red Devils seemed to lack any sort of identity under the haphazard style of Ten Hag, ending eighth last season, their lowest Premier League finish.\n\nBut Amorim's 3-5-2 formation, which brought so much success at Sporting, is starting to take shape at United, with diligent counter-pressing instilled in the system.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both scored twice, punishing Everton's individual mistakes, while Amad Diallo was a constant thorn for the opposition.\n\nUnited moved up to ninth in the table and are already eyeing a place back in the Champions League next season - they are just four points adrift of Brighton in fourth position.\n\nAmorim drew at Ipswich in his first game, defeated Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League on Thursday and got another victory here. But Rashford, for one, is not getting carried away.\n\n\"The energy and the atmosphere speaks for itself,\" Rashford told BBC Match of the Day. \"It is down to the players to create this in the stadium but the fans today... that is what we want to hear: Nothing but positivity and pushing the fans forward.\"\n\n\"He \\[Ruben Amorim\\] is definitely demanding but there's encouragement to bring your strengths into the game. That is when you get a really good team performance.\n\n\"Hopefully we can build on this and keep pushing. It's nothing to get overly excited by. We have to keep pushing every day to meet his demands.\"\n\nThis was the first of nine games in an arduous December for Amorim and United and with time on the training ground limited during this period, his skillset will be tested with away trips to Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham coming up.\n\nMedia caption,\n\nManchester United 4-0 Everton: Red Devils far from perfect says Ruben Amorim\n\n'These moments will live with me for life'\n\nThere was a display of disgruntlement from United supporters before Sunday's game, as they protested outside the ground about the hike in ticket prices for members.\n\n\"Stop Exploiting Loyalty\" read a banner after the club removed concessions, increasing ticket prices to £66 - previously it was £40 for adults and £25 for children.\n\nBut the extra cash may well be worth paying as those inside the stadium witnessed United scoring four goals in a league game for the first time since April.\n\nRashford's goal 20 seconds into the second half effectively ended the match as a contest, allowing home players and supporters to enjoy the remainder of the game.\n\nUnited were in full command, sparking \"oles\" from jubilant fans, with Amorim's name being sung to the tune of Give It Up by KC and The Sunshine Band.\n\n\"Of course I am managing expectations but these moments will live with me for life,\" Amorim told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We start the game with the songs and I already know some of the phrases to these and that moment I really live it, I enjoy that moment.\n\n\"But when the game is there, I want to help my players, I want to win games and to have more years and more games of hearing that song.\"",

Joshua Zirkzee struck before half time to put United 2-0 up.\n\nAmad celebrates with Fernandes and Zirkzee\n\nRashford grabbed his second to end the game as a contest shortly after the break and Zirkzee then joined him on two goals for the afternoon to make it 4-0.\n\nHere are how the players rated at Old Trafford:\n\n**Andre Onana**\n\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\n\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\n\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\n\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought.

        "article_headline": "LUCKHURST: Amad responds perfectly to Ruben Amorim's touchline reactions in Manchester United win",
        "article_text": "Man United secured a first four-goal victory in the Premier League in Ruben Amorim's first league match in charge at Old Trafford.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite did not get his move to Manchester United in the summer yet he stepped up as their 12th man against Everton.\n\nA deflection and a dozy pass from the centre back gifted United both of their first-half goals to turn the game on its head. Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\n\nUnited were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\n\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \"Amorim's Red and White Army\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\n\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\n\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\n\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \"Five Cantonas\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\n\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\n\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\n\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \"Olé\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\n\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\n\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\n\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\n\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\n\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\n\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\n\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\n\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\n\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\n\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\n\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\n\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.",

He was really good defending and really good attacking.\n\n\"So he needs to continue to play like that. You could feel it at the end of the game he was really, really tired, so we need to manage that to increase physical ability.\"\n\nUnited scored early on in Amorim's first two games in charge but the 39-year-old refused to take too much credit for their fast starts. \"No, I’m just really, really lucky,\" he laughed.\n\n\"We want to play well because it’s better to start a game by scoring. If you look at the three games, all the decisive moments were for us. You have to acknowledge that.\n\n\"Today we started very well but lost the control of the game. We were following the ball without any possession after the 15 minutes, but then we score in the set-piece play, so that was a key point for us. And near half-time we scored again, and then we scored the third goal.\n\n\"So we must acknowledge that in the right moments in these three games we scored goals. On Thursday, we controlled the ball well but today we had some difficulties.\n\n\"After the 15 minutes and we had some possession just to keep the ball, not to be so dangerous, but let’s see. Three games without training they did a great job. This victory is more for the players than the coach.\"\n\nUnited take on Arsenal away at the Emirates on Wednesday night. Mikel Arteta's side head into the game on the back of a 5-2 win against West Ham and the Gunners are fighting to win the title.\n\nArsenal have won their last three league games against United and they beat the Reds 3-1 at the Emirates last season.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United fans are fuming after the club announced it was raising prices and scrapping concessions.\n\nBy Chris Slater Senior Reporter\n\n15:32, 1 DEC 2024\n\nHundreds of Reds' fans congregated and unfurled a banner reading \"stop exploiting loyalty.\" A chorus of angry and abusive chants were aimed at both the Glazer family and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nAmidst the wall of noise and red smoke bombs, three young fans shuffled their way to the front. They were holding up a homemade cardboard sign which read: \"Man Utd - ripping off kids.\" An adult supporter ran over and pointed at them as the fans sang \"£66, you're taking the p**s.\"\n\nStood not far from them was lifelong Red Ross Jenkins, 41, from Sale. On his shoulders sat his eight year-old son William. He too had a sign. \"It's my fault, so charge me more,\" it read.\n\nRoss doesn't have a season-ticket, but is a long-term 'One United' member and attends games regularly with William and his brother. However, he said: \"Overnight we have been priced out of tickets. I accept some price increases will happen. But to remove a child's price is absolutely appalling.\"\n\nRoss said without concession prices, he would be unable to afford to take his kids to the match, and that if they couldn't go, he wouldn't either.\n\n\"It breaks your heart,\" he said. \"As a dad it's one of things that you look forward to and relish doing. I've always been a big believer in bringing them to see football live, not just watching it on TV. \n\n\"And how is Manchester United going to be sustained without these young fans who are the future of the club? It's just so sad. If they can't go I won't be going,\" he added. \"'I'm also thinking of asking for a refund for my membership.\"\n\nAnthony Talbot, 49, and his 11-year-old son Finn, from Wythenshawe, have season tickets which are at this stage unaffected. However they said they believed all fans had to \"make a stand\" against the decision.\n\n\"They are taking the p**s,\" Anthony said. \"They are forcing young and working-class fans away from the club. For example, a dad who wants to bring his three kids, is looking at paying getting on towards 300 quid. That's before your travel, your food and everything else.\n\n\"People just aren't going to be able to afford that. They are forcing supporters out. It's as if they just want the corporate fans in the ground and it will become lifeless.\"\n\nAnother banner, aimed at Failsworth-born Sir Jim Ratcliffe, read: \"Local lad Sir Jim charges £66 for OAPS+Juniors. Stop exploiting loyalty.\"\n\nFans sang \"Manchester boy, you're having a laugh\", \"you're not one of us, you greedy ****\" at Sir Jim amongst chants deriding the Glazer family and urging them to fully sell the club.\n\nThe protest was organised by United fan group The 1958. Spokesman Steve Crompton told the Manchester Evening News he reacted with \"utter disgust\" when he first heard of the planned price increases, which the club didn't consult on.\n\nSteve said: \"It's an absolute disgrace. They have not consulted with anyone, they have just decided 'this is what we're going to do.' This must be Sir Jim Ratcliffe's way of 'putting the Manchester back into Manchester United.' \n\n\"I am going to assume he's a smart man, as he's made a bob or two during his life. He knew what he was getting on board with. If things are so bad he has to penalise match-going fans like this, then it really is a shocking state of affairs.\"\n\n\"I have spoken to three or four supporters clubs who are worried about closing. They rely on filling coaches to the game, and if they can't fill the coach because people can't afford tickets, then they will die. Match-going fans are being penalised, it's not on.\"\n\nEverton fan David Fehily, 61, and chair of the club's fan advisory board, Dave Kelly, 66, were among those of the Blue persuasion who came to show their support for the campaign spearheaded by The Football Supporters Association.\n\n\"We believe this isn't a club-by-club issue, this is a national issue\" David said. \"Everton is unusual as we have a high number of juniors and OAPs who this would affect. We have to stand together.\"",

        "article_text": "Manchester United picked up a big victory in Ruben Amorim's first home Premier League match as Everton fell to a 4-0 defeat.\n\nBy Jack FlinthamSport Central Audience Writer\n\nManchester United's loanee winger Jadon Sancho has sent his support to Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford after the Reds' 4-0 win over Everton on Sunday.\n\nUnited were dominant against the Merseyside club with Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both grabbing braces either side of half-time. The win moved Ruben Amorim's team back into the top half of the Premier League table, just four points behind Manchester City in fifth who lost 2-0 at Liverpool on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAs we have become accustomed to following victories, United players took to Instagram at full-time to celebrate the victory. Rashford posted: \"Top team performance,\" while captain Fernandes added: \"A nice Sunday at home.\"\n\nBoth posts were liked by Sancho despite him being on loan at Premier League rivals Chelsea. The winger joined the London club with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.\n\nAt the time, Sancho's relationship with then-manager Erik ten Hag remained frosty. Despite the Dutchman insisting that he had buried the hatchet with the English winger, the consensus at United was that he would be better off leaving.\n\nAfter starting well at Stamford Bridge, Sancho's form did drop but a good performance at Heidenheim in the Conference League earned him a start against Aston Villa this weekend. The United loanee played 71 minutes as Enzo Maresca's side ran out 3-0 winners while the Reds were picking up three points.\n\nSancho's future at Chelsea will be confirmed at the end of the season with United banking £25m in the deal.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United scored four as they defeated Everton comfortably at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon\n\nManchester United legend Roy Keane believes Ruben Amorim's ability to get the strikers scoring again at Old Trafford is a big positive for the Reds so early into his new era.\n\nUnited were dominant on Sunday afternoon as Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both bagged braces as Everton were thrashed at the Theatre of Dreams. The result moved United up into the top half of the Premier League table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\n\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the Erik ten Hag era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\n\nKeane picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League. \"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals [is impressive],\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\n\n\"Whatever the problems [Man United] have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\n\n\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\"\n\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.",

He has to continue to improve.\n\n\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\"\n\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\" he said.\n\n\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus [Hojlund], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\n\n\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\"\n\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\" said Amorim about potential [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) qualification.\n\n\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results. We’ll see in the end. I’ve said this many times, I will be judged on where we finish, I know that, but let’s focus on the next game and look at the performance.\n\n\"On Thursday, it was a 3-2 and I think we deserved more.

The game was suspended after 25 minutes with Bove stretchered off and taken to hospital.\n\nDe Gea, who joined the Italian side over the summer and has played 10 times in Serie A alongside Bove, started the game. He was among those who were extremely worried on the field after Bove fell to the ground.\n\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \"God Please 🙏\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\n\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\n\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\n\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from Old Trafford.\n\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \"Come on Edo. We are with you!\"\n\nFellow ex-Manchester United star Paul Pogba was among others to offer their support. \"Forza @edo_bove 🙏\" he wrote on his Instagram story with a blank background. Former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli did the same. He wrote: \"@edo_bove Prego di rivederti così al più presto Ti abbraccio forte 💪\", which translates as, \"I pray to see you again as soon as possible I hug you tightly.\"\n\nRomelu Lukaku and Tammy Abraham, who were both at Roma last season but now play at Napoli and AC Milan respectively, have also posted to their Instagram stories for Bove.\n\nBove has played 11 league games for La Viola this season, winning the last seven he has started alongside De Gea. The pair have only failed to win twice when playing together, only one was a defeat.",

The former Manchester United goalkeeper started the match before it had to be suspended.\n\nBove, 22, fell to the ground early on with players and medical staff rushing to his aid. A wall of bodies was formed to protect the Italian from being visible.\n\nPlay was officially stopped by the referee 10 minutes after Bove went down. Some of those on the field were left in tears at the disturbing scenes.\n\nBove was taken to hospital after being stretched off the field, lead directly into a pitchside ambulance. Both sets of players went down the tunnel shortly after with play being cut short.\n\nIt is reported that the player bent down to tie his laces before collapsing. Nobody is said to have been around him when it happened.\n\nInter posted online to signal that the game had been suspended due to a medical emergency. No official statement from the league has been issued as of yet, although the Serie A X(formerly Twitter) account wrote, \"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\" alongside an image of Bove. It translates to: \"Come on Edo. We are with you!\"\n\nDe Gea also sent a message to Bove.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\n\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\n\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \"We keep going,\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\" alongside a love heart emoji.\n\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\n\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\"\n\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the Champions League places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 Premier League matches so far this season.\n\n\"It was far from a perfect performance,\" Amorim added. \"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.",

Shortly before the interval, Zirkzee had his first of the afternoon firing home on the edge of the area after Amad won the ball high up the pitch.\n\nIn the second half, Rashford netted his brace and Zirkzee followed closely afterwards with a calm finish into the bottom corner. While it was good for United to see the English striker move on to seven for the season, it was particularly pleasing to see Zirkzee find his feet.\n\nAfter being signed by Erik ten Hag and not impressing in front of goal, there had been speculation that Zirkzee could be surplus to requirements so soon into his United career. But, getting a start under Amorim and scoring twice will undoubtedly boost his confidence.\n\nFollowing the match both De Ligt and Maguire sent messages to the striker. His Dutch teammate posted a fire emoji alongside a picture of the pair celebrating to which Zirkzee replied with a love heart.\n\nMeanwhile, Maguire wrote: \"Love it,\" accompanied by clapping emojis to which Zirkzee replied: \"Big man.\" After such a good performance, Amorim now has a selection headache ahead of the midweek trip to Arsenal.\n\nBoth Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee have scored braces in their last appearances for United and will both be vying for a starting spot at the Emirates Stadium.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United history is about to repeat itself with £72million player - and it's good news - Steven Railston - Manchester Evening News\n\nRasmus Hojlund scored a brace in the Europa League on Thursday night and he must kick on after that display.\n\nJust as Ramsus Hojlund found his stride last season, he picked an injury that disrupted his rhythm.\n\nHojlund sustained a muscle injury against Luton Town on February 18 and confirmation that he was facing a few weeks on the sidelines came after he scored seven goals in six games.\n\nThe young striker scored in successive games against Tottenham, Newport County, Wolves, West Ham, Aston Villa and Luton but actually turned a corner before that run of games.\n\nHojlund had no problem scoring in the Champions League group stage, impressively scoring five times in Europe, but he had to wait until December to score his first goal in the Premier League, finally getting that monkey off his back when scoring a brace against Villa on Boxing Day.\n\n**ALSO READ:** **[Ratcliffe must make a U-turn after United price hike]**\n\nDuring the period that Hojlund hadn't scored in the league, he played it down but he was clearly relieved when he got off the mark. Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\n\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\n\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\n\nHojlund made his comeback against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\n\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\n\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was a tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\n\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\"\n\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\n\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\n\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\n\n\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\n\n\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\"\n\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\n\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.",

        "article_text": "Wayne Rooney has suffered a huge setback at Plymouth (Image: Joe Toth/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nEx-Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has struggled to find the spark that would ignite his managerial career so far, with short stints at Derby County, Birmingham City and Major League Soccer side DC United ending in misery. The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\n\nRooney began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\n\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\n\nArgyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\"\n\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\"\n\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\"\n\nAnother fan agrees: \"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\"\n\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.\n\n**Have your say! What should Wayne Rooney's path towards being a top manager look like? Do you think he can do it?**",

        "article_text": "Liam Delap of Ipswich Town continues to catch the attention since leaving Manchester City in the summer. So much so that he has been linked with a return to the Etihad Stadium, though Manchester United are also on his trail. However, a new report by the Mirror suggests Juventus are eyeing the forward as a replacement for Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nThe Italian giants are said to be keen to tie Vlahovic to a new deal but talks over an extension have failed to bear fruit. As a result, that has forced them to look at potential alternatives and Delap is said to fit the profile the club are looking for.\n\nThe report claims Juve are drawing up contingency plans in case an agreement cannot be reached. So much so that they have already watched Delap in action for Ipswich at Portman Road this campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, United and Chelsea are also monitoring his progress. But it's City who have an advantage over other clubs after negotiating a 20 per cent sell-on clause with Ipswich.\n\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna has refused to speak over Delap's future. He said: \"It's not anything I'm aware of or interested in to be honest. I think that's a question for other people and for [chairman] Mark Ashton.\n\n\"My full focus is on this season and, with regards to Liam, trying to help him to continue to improve. I know Liam's full focus is here and trying to help the team. He's had a good start to the season, but we have to remember that's it's very early stages for him.\n\n\"This is really his first season starting regularly as a number nine. He played off the side a lot of times last year at Hull, played as a wide striker in some earlier Championship loan moves. So this is his first season doing it week-in, week-out, maybe doing it two times a week, and he's doing it at Premier League level. It's positive that he's doing well, but it's really early days. His focus, my focus, our focus is to keep trying to improve.\"\n\nDelap scored a goal and provided an assist as Ipswich recorded a 2-1 win away at Tottenham Hotspur. The win in North London was Ipswich's first victory in the top flight this season since their promotion from the Championship. He also put in a fine performance in the 1-1 draw with United at Portman Road last month.",

        "article_headline": "Jamie Carragher hits back after Mo Salah calls him out in post-match interview following Man City game",
        "article_text": "Jamie Carragher responds after Mo Salah aims dig at him in post-match interview following Man City game - Liverpool - SPORTbible\n===============\n\n**Jamie Carragher has added fuel to the fire after Mohamed Salah responded to the former Liverpool defender in his post-match interview on Sunday.**\n\nLiverpool moved nine points clear at the top of the Premier League with a convincing 2-0 win over Manchester City, as goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah opened up an 11-point gap between themselves and City.\n\nIt was an outstanding team performance from Arne Slot's side, who have won 18 games out of a possible 20 this season – a remarkable record all things considered.\n\nBut rather than the result, one of the big talking points on Sunday night was a post-match interview with Sky Sports involving goalscorer Salah and captain Virgil van Dijk.\n\nAs you can see from the footage below, Van Dijk was asked to choose between himself and Salah for Player of the Match. The Dutchman responded: \"I'm surprised Carragher wouldn't give it to you.\"\n\nSalah, who has been criticised by Carragher in recent days, replied: \"Ah no, he [Carragher] wouldn't give it to me. Never. He wouldn't! I don't want to talk about this!\"\n\nMoments later, when the cameras cut back to the Sky Sports studio, presenter David Jones asked Carragher for his take on Salah's comments.\n\nThe former Liverpool centre-back would then reference Roy Keane's bust-up with an Ipswich Town fan last week and joked that he would arrange to meet Salah \"in the carpark\" after he called him out.\n\nAnd shortly after, Carragher took to X, formerly Twitter, to add more fuel to the fire. Responding to a video of the post-match interview, he replied: \"I would’ve give it to VVD to be fair!\" – in reference to Salah being awarded the Player of the Match by co-commentator Gary Neville, who had the final say.\n\nAs mentioned above, Carragher has recently criticised Salah for publicly speculating about his future. Last weekend, after scoring twice in the 3-2 win over Southampton at St Mary's, Salah revealed that he is yet to receive a contract offer ahead of his deal expiring at the end of the season.\n\n\"We are almost in December and I haven't received any offers yet to stay in the club,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm probably more out than in. You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\"\n\nCarragher responded to the interview by saying he was \"very disappointed\" at those comments. \"That interview yesterday, Liverpool have got Real Madrid midweek and they’ve got Manchester City at the weekend. That’s the story for Liverpool right now,\" he added.\n\n\"The most important thing is Liverpool winning the Premier League - that is more important than any of those players. And if he continues to put comments out or his agent keeps putting cryptic tweets out, that’s selfish. That’s thinking about themselves and not the football club.\"",

The atmosphere was incredible so I will enjoy every second here. Hopefully we just win the league and will see what will happen.\"\n\nSpeaking in the Sky Sports studio following the game, Carragher doubled down on his previous take.\n\n“I have no problem with Salah and Van Dijk,\" he said.\n\n\"They are two of the greatest for Liverpool. Liverpool are a club run by data. I’m not saying he shouldn’t get a two-year deal or give him big money.",

Respect.\"\n\nGuardiola's side put in a disjointed performance at Anfield.\n\nNext up, City will play host to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday 4 December before they travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on Saturday 7 December.\n\nAs for Liverpool, their captain Virgil van Dijk explained how they were not getting ahead of themselves despite being top of the league.\n\n\"I think City is a fantastic team,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"Four-time champions in a row.

        "article_text": "In his latest post-match press conference, Ruben Amorim credited predecessor Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping improve one of his top performers.\n\nAmorim claimed his first Premier League win as Manchester United head coach on Sunday afternoon as they sealed a comfortable 4-0 victory over Everton thanks to goals from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nUnited were never able to win a Premier League game by four goals during Erik ten Hag's two-year reign but Amorim has managed to get the best out of his forward players in recent days, scoring seven goals in two games.\n\nFor many, the standout player since his appointment has been Amad Diallo, who provided two assists against Sean Dyche's side.\n\nAfter being deployed at right-wing-back in their 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town last month, the in-form Diallo earned plaudits from his new manager.\n\n\"I think it was very good, he [Amad] has improved a lot,\" said Amorim. \"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\"\n\nNow, the Portuguese coach has praised Diallo further but instead of taking all the credit, he pointed in the direction of former interim manager Van Nistelrooy, who recently took the job at Leicester City.\n\nSpeaking in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: \"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he also has to improve.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old continued: \"‘He was really good again. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he’s helping me. He’s in a great moment, but that moment started with Ruud. So I just take advantage of Ruud’s work with Amad.\"\n\nAmorim wasn't done there. \"He was really good defending and really good attacking so he has to continue to play like that,\" he added. \"You could feel it in the end of the game he was really, really tired so we have to manage that and increase his physical ability.\n\n\"I’d like to take credit for it [Amad’s pressing], but that’s him. He’s like that. He’s smart. He’s explosive.\"\n\nVan Nistelrooy, who joined United's coaching staff in the summer alongside fellow assistant Rene Hake, was ushered into the hot seat when Erik ten Hag was sacked last month.\n\nHe took charge of four matches across all competitions and stayed unbeaten with three wins and a draw. Despite his success, Amorim decided against handing the Dutchman a place in his backroom staff.",

        "article_text": "Fans are genuinely baffled by Erik ten Hag decision after Amad Diallo produces masterclass against Everton - Man Utd - SPORTbible\n===============\n\n**It's been just over a month since Erik ten Hag was relieved of his duties by Manchester United but he still remains a huge talking point amongst fans, especially after this weekend's game against Everton.**\n\nUnited walked away with all three points on Sunday afternoon as goals from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee sealed a convincing 4-0 victory over Everton.\n\nAfter securing his first win as United manager on Thursday against Bodo/Glimt, you could say it has been a solid start to life at Old Trafford for Ruben Amorim, who has publicly praised a number of his players in recent days.\n\nHaving been deployed at right-wing-back in their 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town, the in-form Amad Diallo received plaudits from his new manager.\n\n\"I think it was very good, he has improved a lot,\" said Amorim. \"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him, the opponent he had all the time was the left back. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\"\n\nAmad continued his superb run of form against Everton on Sunday as he notched two assists.\n\nAnd after impressing once more at Old Trafford, plenty of fans brought up Erik ten Hag and his decision to use the Ivorian sparingly throughout his reign as manager.\n\nIn fact, Ten Hag's decision to use Antony over Amad as they searched for a winner against Fenerbache in October was mentioned by many on social media.\n\nOne said: \"The fact ETH watched him every day in training and continued to play Antony over him blows my mind. What a player we have in Amad,\" while another commented: \"Not sure I’ll ever forgive Erik Ten Hag for his treatment of Amad Diallo.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"Bizarre that it took more than four months for Amad to get a start last season. Even more bizarre that Omari Forson once started ahead of him. He's torn Everton to shreds today. Perfect profile of player for Amorim in this formation.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"Erik ten Hag should be hired just so he can be fired again. Why on God’s green earth did he not platform Amad?!\" and a fifth added: \"Amad is the best pressing player we have by a million miles, and Ten Hag, who wanted to play pressing football, barely used him.\"\n\nTen Hag said Antony was starting ahead of Amad because he was better in training.😂😂😂\n\nAfter that match against Fenerbache in the Champions League, Ten Hag explained his decision. \"Amad, he is doing well,\" he said. \"But I must also reward the performances of Antony in training. He is a threat almost every training session, so I felt in that moment the right thing to do was bring him on to decide the game.\"\n\nAmad was eventually brought on after Antony picked up an injury in the latter stages but the change was deemed too late for many supporters.\n\nThoughts on Amad's form of late? Let us know in the comments.",

        "article_text": "Jamie Carragher has pointed out a flaw in Gary Neville’s proposed rule change for the Premier League – but both have a point.\n\nCarragher, 46, and Neville, 49, have become an unlikely duo on British television screens as they regularly work together on Sky Sports’ Premier League coverage.\n\nLast night, Neville was present at the London Stadium for Arsenal’s 5-2 trouncing of West Ham United.\n\nNeville regularly voices his opinions on all on and off-pitch matters related to football, but his latest suggestion will ring true with fans of most clubs.\n\nWith the scores at 5-2, both sides made changes at half-time, with Edson Alvarez replacing Crysencio Summerville for West Ham, while Arsenal’s Jakub Kiwior replaced Gabriel Magalhães in the Gunners’ defence.\n\nOn 56 minutes, Oleksandr Zinchenko was introduced in place of Riccardo Calafiori before nine minutes later, the Hammers replaced goal scorer Emerson with Vladimir Coufal, and Danny Ings came on for Michail Antonio.\n\nThen, to the dismay of Neville, Arsenal made two more changes just nine minutes later, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus came on for Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.\n\nAnd in theme with the second half, the Irons waited three minutes before making another double substitution of their own when Guido Rodriguez replaced Lucas Pacqueta and Andy Irving came on for Carlos Soler.\n\nThen, just seven minutes later, Arsenal youngster Ethan Nwaneri was introduced in place of Leandro Trossard.\n\nOf course, both sides were acting within the laws of the game by making five substitutions each – but Neville had seemingly seen enough.\n\n\"The rhythm of the game just gets broken with all these subs,” said an annoyed-sounding Neville.\n\nFrom the 2022/23 season, teams were allowed a further two substitutions (previously allowed three changes), which could take place in three blocks.\n\nNeville previously suggested the idea of ‘rolling substitutions’ on The Overlap brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\nSeveral other sports, including basketball and handball use the method.\n\n\"Let the fourth official manage substitutions so that the game doesn't have to stop, and you can just run on and off,\" he said.\n\n\"So basically, (Martin) Odegaard's coming on for (Leandro) Trossard, the fourth official's there, he gets a message to Trossard, 'you're off' and Trossard comes off.\"\n\nHowever, Carragher was not totally convinced by the idea.\n\n“You (a player on the pitch) wouldn't look at the bench, would you?” said Carragher.",

He’s been our best player this season.”\n\nAnother added: “Eriksen has been arguably our player of the season but Amorim hardly includes him in our match day squad. Why?”\n\nA third commented: “Can’t believe I’m saying this in 2025 - but we need to play Eriksen.”\n\nWhile a fourth gave a different take: “I can't wait to see Manuel Ugarte replace Casemiro.

        "article_text": "**Liverpool could look to sign a player from one of their Premier League rivals to bolster their attack, it has been claimed.**\n\nThe Reds have made a near-flawless start to the campaign under Arne Slot. They are at the Premier League summit, having won 17 of their 19 games under the Dutchman.\n\nBut the Merseysiders may still look to spend in the January transfer window, to bolster their chances of claiming a first Premier League title in five years and only their second since 1990.\n\nAccording to Football Insider correspondent Peter O’Rourke, Bournemouth are expected to entertain offers for Antoine Semenyo amid interest from Liverpool.\n\nWhile January is unlikely, the publication has claimed the Cherries will not stand in the player’s way should he wish to make the move in the summer.\n\nWhile the Reds are said to be open to signings should the right opportunity present itself in January, they are unlikely to be among the window’s biggest spenders.\n\nSemenyo, who the Guardian described as “dazzling” back in November, is thought to be on Liverpool’s radar as a potential replacement for Mohamed Salah, amid speculation surrounding the Egyptian’s future.\n\nFollowing a 3-2 win against Southampton, Salah admitted he was “more out than in”, and admitted no formal contract offer has been made over a new contract, with his current deal set to expire in the summer.\n\n\"Well, we are almost in December and I haven't received any offers yet to stay in the club,\" the 32-year-old told the media. \"I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said before, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\"\n\nAsked if he was disappointed there had been no new offer from Liverpool, Salah said: \"Of course, yeah. I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands. Let's wait and see.\n\n\"I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.

Everybody has to play and everybody has to train.\n\n“It’s impossible in three days to recover all the players. We played in a different game against Bodo/Glimt.\n\n\"We press a lot, some players were tired, so I prefer for fresh legs and for different characteristics to be harder for the opponents to understand how we are going to play.\n\n“We have returns like Kobbie Mainoo, one of the best young guys in this league. We have international players like I say all the time, so they are ready to win the game.”\n\nFans gave their thoughts on social media with many expecting the Dane to be given the nod given his impressive performance last time out.\n\nZirkzee has struggled to settle since arriving from Bologna in the summer transfer window. Although he scored the only goal on his debut during a 1-0 win against Fulham on the Premier League's opening night, he has failed to find the net since and has even been linked with a move away from United.",

        "article_text": "Arne Slot has made his feelings clear on Pep Guardiola as Liverpool prepare to host title rivals Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nArguably the biggest game of the season so far takes place at Anfield on Sunday afternoon, with visitors City in desperate need of a victory.\n\nGuardiola's side are without a win in their last six matches in all competitions after throwing away a three-goal lead against Slot's former club Feyenoord in the Champions League on Tuesday night.\n\nThe defending Premier League champions are already eight points behind surprise league leaders Liverpool heading into Sunday's game and a defeat on Merseyside would be a devastating blow to their hopes of securing a fifth successive title this season.\n\nCity have only won away at Liverpool three times since 1956, with Guardiola himself only claiming one of these victories – a 4-1 win over an injury-ravaged Reds side in 2021.\n\nSpeaking ahead of this weekend's game, Liverpool head coach Slot said he had contacted his former colleagues at Feyenoord after their remarkable comeback against City and made his feelings very clear on Guardiola.\n\n\"I got in touch but not in a tactical way,\" he said.\n\n\"I just contacted people I worked with to say 'what an amazing result and congratulations with the unbelievable performance' and those kinds of things.\n\n\"I don't look up to Pep - that's not the words I would want to use. I think the reason for this is that Liverpool have always had great teams as well.\n\n\"So it's a combination of the fans and the players. If you only had good fans and terrible players it is difficult to win any game. But if you have very good players and the fans are all behind you, this always gives you something extra.\"\n\nOn Guardiola's underwhelming record at Anfield, Slot added: \"What is even stranger than that is that the only time Liverpool have won the league in the last 30 years was when there were no fans!\n\n\"I think another statistic is that from the last nine or 10 games we have played against City, we have only won once.\n\n\"The last eight times we played Real Madrid we had never won - until the other night when we won. So for me, data and statistics like that don't mean a lot with this game.\"\n\nGuardiola, meanwhile, has accused City's rivals of \"taking the p** out of them and admits he's lost sleep over their disastrous run of form in recent weeks.\n\n\"I don't like it. I don't enjoy it at all. I don't sleep as good as when I won every game,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe it's more unusual to win four Premier League titles in a row. In that moment I was stable enough, I was happy because I eat better and sleep better.\"\n\nLiverpool are now just six points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table after the Gunners thrashed West Ham 5-2 at the Emirates on Saturday.",

A curious one to consider.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that Arsenal are (it would appear) second on away goals scored against Chelsea, rather than alphabetical order.\n\nIf the head-to-head doesn’t separate the teams, then it comes down to away goals in the head-to-head, and Arsenal scored in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea on 10 November.\n\n“If any clubs finish with the same number of points, their position in the Premier League table is determined by goal difference, then the number of goals scored, then the team who collected the most points in the head-to-head matches, then who scored most away goals in the head-to-head.”\n\nNeto cancels out Martinelli’s opener as Chelsea and Arsenal share spoils.\n\n“Anyone turning up at Chelsea with hopes of seeing a wild exhibition of end-to-end, brainless football should start making alternative plans. They are maturing nicely under Enzo Maresca, whose focus on control is squeezing the life out of opposition sides, and continued their rise with this emphatic win over a supine Aston Villa.”\n\nCole Palmer’s party piece adds gloss as Chelsea compound Aston Villa’s worries.\n\nIt would be tempting to talk of Tottenham at least being predictable in their unpredictability, of the way they cannot but follow up a great result with a disappointing one, of the inevitability of them, having beaten Manchester City 4-0 last weekend, failing to beat Fulham at home this. But actually the story on Sunday was far more about Fulham, how well they played and how mystifying it was they didn’t take all three points having had the better of the majority of the game.\n\nWatching the Palmer goal again, it remains absolutely stunning, but Emery will be furious at the lack of urgency from his defenders. They just look knackered.\n\nStat attack: Chelsea move joint-second, also known as third. They have an identical record to Arsenal, but are third on alphabetical order.\n\nPlayed 13, won seven, drawn 4, lost two, goal difference +12.\n\nWhy not treat yourself and check out the table here.\n\n“You want Liverpool v Manchester City? Of course you do. John Brewin has all the action.”\n\n“Whip-dee-doo-dah,” is pundit Daniel Sturridge’s assessment of Palmer’s goal as he watches the replay. And I know exactly what he means.\n\nVilla were way off the pace. But Cole Palmer is a true artist, the Paul Cézanne of the Premier League.\n\nAll part of our growth. Their growth, that is.\n\n“Oh, Tom Cairney was sent off for Fulham a while back there, having scored the equaliser.”\n\nFive added minutes, minimum, at Chelsea.\n\nHeady days at Old Trafford, with Amorim off to an exceptional start.\n\n89 min: Felix brings a good save from Olsen as Chelsea go hunting more goals. Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\n\n87 min: As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent Chelsea display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\n\nOh my word that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him.\n\nCole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that.",

        "article_text": "Rashford and Zirkzee double up as Manchester United dismantle Everton | Premier League | The Guardian\n\nJoshua Zirkzee scores Manchester United’s fourth goal. Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\n\nRashford and Zirkzee double up as Manchester United dismantle Everton\n\n“Amorim, Ruben Amorim, nananananananaaa,” the jubilant Manchester United fans chorused after the impressive Joshua Zirkzee’s second goal. Sung to the melody of KC and the Sunshine Band’s Give It Up, this was the last thing the new manager’s players did: fail to go after any apparent lost cause in case gold could be mined.\n\nIt was how Zirkzee struck United’s fourth. From deep in his area, the substitute Luke Shaw headed out. The ball came to Amad Diallo, who rolled it along the right wing into space. Over thundered Marcus Rashford, who failed to connect but, when the ball was passed back to James Tarkowski, there was Diallo harrying. Everton’s captain dawdled, the right wing‑back pilfered possession, sprinted ahead, squared left to United’s centre-forward and he rammed home.\n\nAmorim explained beforehand why, after parachuting in with 11 Premier League games of the season gone, United are instantly playing his 3-4-3. “That would only postpone our problems,” the manager said, meaning that whatever is suffered short term would allow jam tomorrow.\n\nOn Sunday there was delight only. Rashford, too, scored twice, and though United were not perfect they were energetic and, just as vitally, up for what their new manager demands.\n\nThe No 10 said: “It wasn’t as easy as it looked today. Amad did well to counter-press for two of the goals. He’s so sharp and he’s always got the intent to push the other team back, with and without the ball. It is for the players to understand the strengths of other players so we can feed off each other.\n\n“He [Amorim] is definitely demanding but encouraging to bring your strengths into the game. That is when you get a really good team performance.”\n\nAs the truism goes, the best coaches improve players, and Zirkzee may become Exhibit A of the Portuguese’s smarts if this performance is replicated weekly. The Dutchman’s nascent United career had already been questioned yet the offering on Sunday showed a fine technician, brave in receiving the ball despite knowing an ankle chopping was always incoming.\n\nIf Amorim’s three games in charge have bedded him to his on-field task, the fan protest against the club’s ticket price hike – to a minimum £66 for child or adult – offers the same for the surrounding, never-ending subplots of the United soap opera.\n\nHeld before kick-off at the Trinity statue, supporters’ ire was directed at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is responsible for the dizzying rise with junior admission having been £25. They urged the minority owner to “sell United and fuck off home” and informed him “we want our club back”. This was the polar opposite of the affection directed at Amorim as he oversaw what was a succession of chances from first kick to last.\n\nMarcus Rashford was back on form scoring a double for the first time since February 2023. Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\n\nKobbie Mainoo, one of six changes, let fly at Jordan Pickford. Zirkzee, starting too for the first time under Amorim, dropped back to execute a sharp shoe-shuffle and sprayed the ball wide. Suddenly United were near the opposition area and we saw how Amorim-ball is designed to hurt.\n\nEverton were bogged down in the middle third as red shirts would crowd around, nick the ball and launch another raid. This was the pattern when Bruno Fernandes received on the left and struck a pass with the outside of his right boot. In ran Rashford whose attempted chip of an onrushing Pickford failed.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt also failed in an attempt at stopping the pacy Beto as he latched on to Dwight McNeil’s threaded pass. So the centre-back continued on, made himself a nuisance as Beto tried to round André Onana, and United escaped.\n\nEverton did not when Fernandes swung in a corner. A training ground routine, the ball was floated to Rashford, whose half‑volley appeared to be goalward before Jarrad Branthwaite stuck out a leg and deflected it past Pickford.\n\nZirkzee’s second goal for the club was a product of what might be named the “Amorim press” – Branthwaite, again, the patsy. This time he hesitated, Diallo rushed him, nabbed the ball, Fernandes took over and, entering Everton’s area, fed Zirkzee: the 6ft 4in striker surged forward to smash in a left-footed finish.\n\nThe same urgency was evident in United’s third that came after the second-half kick-off. The ball was played to Pickford, who hoofed upfield and Amorim’s men took over. Zirkzee collected and swivelled and passed to Diallo who rushed forward and fed the overlapping Rashford: an instant hit beat Pickford and that was his first double in United colours since February 2023.\n\nFernandes, one of Amorim’s five substitutions, later sat with an ice pack on his left foot. A worry for the captain and United but the wider picture suggests this was a fine day for the Amorim project: a victory of dominance in the 39-year-old’s first home league outing.",

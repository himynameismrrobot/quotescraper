        "article_text": "Manchester United\n=================\n\nLatest updates\n--------------\n\n1.  **Simon Stone**  \n    Chief football news reporter\n    \n    Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt flew into Manchester on Wednesday before the Europa League match with Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n    \n    While Glimt are currently establishing themselves as Norway's top team, that has not always been the case.\n    \n    Sporting director Havard Sakariassen used to be a player at the club and he remembered a period where the squad had to wash their own kit.\n    \n    \"If you go back to the year in 2009-2011, the club was struggling really hard financially,\" he said.\n    \n    \"I had my last season in 2011 as a player. In mid-season that year I quit. I was old and not any good. I left the changing room and went upstairs.\n    \n    \"At that time the club was in such bad conditions that we didn't have a kit manager. We washed our training gear at home and came to training already dressed. That was the situation at Bodo/Glimt in 2011.\n    \n    \"We had one person working for the A team that autumn. That was me. I was the kit man.\"\n    \n    Even though the Norwegian champions accept they can never come close to matching the financial muscle Premier League clubs receive, they do not travel to Manchester without belief of causing a shock.\n    \n    \"We don't have the resources you see at top clubs in England,\" Sakariassen added. \"We will never, ever be able to compete with that.\n    \n    \"But we truly believe in development and that we can get the potential out of the players we have here. If we can do that, as individuals and as a team, it is huge. Then you can make a great team and it goes a long way.\n    \n    \"Maybe I am naive.

I am really well aware of that.\n    \n    \"During training I try to absorb everything, from every position. I try to have an understanding of the game because being the captain, the manager cannot always give the message from the bench to the pitch. As captain, you have to try to resolve the situation together with your team-mates. Having knowledge of every position is my role.\"\n    \n    Fernandes has four goals and two assists in his past five games in all competitions in November after initially struggling for goal contributions at the start of the season. He is confident he will settle quickly into Amorim's tactical setup.\n    \n    \"I think [adapting to the system] could probably be worse for the younger players - I know what the Sporting players were doing very well,\" he added. \"Not because I was reading what the manager was doing, but because I was watching their games!\"  \n    \n    \"We are international players. Every time you go to the national team, you probably play in a different system. With Portugal, we sometimes play with a back three. I've had that experience of the manager's formation already.\"",

He played his debut there against Wolves and then had a small spell there under Ten Hag. His range of passing can be an asset in that position, but Amorim did say at the weekend that he needs to stop him from playing the long pass as often as he does.\n\n18:48Samuel Luckhurst\n### Amorim makes six changes\n\nThat’s a substantial six changes. It’s not a surprise after Amorim promised to rotate. United have a more important game on Sunday, too.\n\nIt will be a pleasant surprise if tonight is plain sailing for United. Six changes in a new formation, with Mount starting for the first time since August, Malacia for the first time since May 2023 and Antony for the first time since September, means there could be a lot of fine-tuning required.\n\n18:46Steven Railston\n### TEAM NEWS | BODO/GLIMT STARTING XI\n\n18:45KEY EVENT\n### TEAM NEWS | UNITED STARTING XI\n\nXI | Onana, Antony, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Malacia, Fernandes, Ugarte, Mount, Hojlund, Garnacho.\n\nSubs | Bayindir, Heaton, Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Eriksen, Mainoo, Amad, Rashford, Zirkzee.\n\n18:35Steven Railston\n### 10 minutes until team news\n\nNot long until we have the starting teams confirmed.\n\n18:29Tyrone Marshall\n### Malacia could start\n\nThe social media leaks are suggesting Tyrell Malacia could be in line for a first appearance for United since May 2023. He made his comeback for the Under-21s against Huddersfield two weeks ago and looked solid in a 50-minute outing, but this is a significant step up if he does start, especially with the work rate required to play as a wing-back in Amorim’s system.\n\n18:27Samuel Luckhurst\n### Antony and Hojlund to start?\n\nOne of the early whispers is that Antony and Rasmus Hojlund will start with Bruno Fernandes in the front three. That is unconfirmed until an hour and 15 minutes before kick-off.\n\n18:21Samuel Luckhurst\n### Sancho started for Chelsea\n\nIt appears Jadon Sancho is playing a match of football. It has gone quiet about United letting him go after a couple of stats-padding appearances for Chelsea. Nobody has ever watched United this season and concluded, “They missed Sancho today.” And they never will.\n\nAs for the Europa League, United have currently dropped down to 18th. Results are going against them! Alas, there is no jeopardy even if they drop more points against more minnows tonight.\n\n18:08Tyrone Marshall\n### Who will Amorim start?\n\nBe interesting to see how Amorim treats this game tonight and how the team evolves from Sunday. Options to bring players in and the likes of Shaw, Ugarte, Mainoo and Hojlund should be pushing for starts. It would be good to see Mount given a start as well, Amorim clearly likes him. He has always had a reputation for being a coach’s dream and he looks a good fit for one of the No. 10 roles in this side.\n\n18:02Steven Railston\n### Amorim's programme notes\n\nAmorim's appointment makes this game exciting.\n\n17:54Samuel Luckhurst\n### Amorim's first game at Old Trafford\n\nThere will be more interest around Amorim’s first Premier League home game at the weekend but tonight’s tie is undeniably more anticipated now United have a new coach. Bodo/Glimt are one of those teams you underestimate at your peril and United have form for easing off the gas against the purported fodder of the Europa League. Twente is recent proof of that and PAOK had the odd moment at the start of the month.\n\nSo far, so much the same. United have arrived in good time for the game. Ten Hag wanted to relocate to a hotel before home matches last season but was overruled. With money tight, the Ineos cabal best be justifying their existence.\n\n17:42Tyrone Marshall\n### It is freezing cold\n\nIt’s a freezing cold night at Old Trafford, so the team from the Arctic Circle will be right at home. They will also feel at home backed by more than 6,000 fans, who have been making quite a noise and made for quite a sight in Manchester today. It could be some week for the club and their supporters. They play at Old Trafford tonight and on Sunday they just need to beat already relegated Lillestrom at home to win the Norwegian title on the final day of the season.\n\n17:35Steven Railston\n### Will Fernandes be rested?\n\nHe spoke alongside Amorim at yesterday's press conference/\n\n17:12Steven Railston\n### Martinez back in the squad\n\nThe centre-back is available again after recovering from a back injury.\n\n16:48Steven Railston\n### Amorim issues warning to Rashford\n\nAmorim has stressed Marcus Rashford has \"to want it\" if he is to regain his prolific form.\n\n> \"I will try to help him,\" Amorim said. \"That position is not the best one for him, especially in a game like that. We have to kick with high pressure, we have to kick the ball so many times and it was like fighting with two giants.\n> \n> \"We'll try to find the right solution for him, as for the other players. But he has to be Marcus, first of all, to try to return to that moment and then he will have all the help of the staff, the club and the fans because he's a Manchester United boy. But he has to be the first one to want it.\"\n\n16:33Steven Railston\n### United vs Bodo/Glimt odds\n\nAnd United are heavy, heavy favourites to win tonight.\n\n**Betfair - match odds**\n\n*   Man Utd - 1/7\n*   Draw - 5/1\n*   Bodo Glimt - 12/1\n\nOdds via Betfair\n\n16:32Steven Railston\n### Europa League odds\n\nUnited are second favourites to win the Europa League.\n\n**Betfair - Europa League odds**\n\n*   Tottenham - 7/2\n*   Man Utd - 11/2\n*   Athletic Bilbao, Lazio - 9/1\n*   Real Sociedad - 10/1\n*   Roma, Porto, Galatasaray - 14/1\n*   Lyon - 16/1\n*   Eintracht Frankfurt - 18/1\n*   Ajax - 18/1\n*   Olympiacos, Fenerbahce - 20/1\n*   Nice, Hoffenheim, Besiktas, Anderlecht - 50/1\n\nOdds via Betfair\n\n16:11Steven Railston\n### Why Yoro is not training with United\n\nUnited defender Leny Yoro is still not training in every first team session.\n\nYoro was involved in new head coach Ruben Amorim's first team training session last Monday but he was absent from the travelling squad for the Premier League draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 19-year-old was missing again for United's session on Wednesday ahead of their Europa League tie against Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford tomorrow night.\n\n[United sources say Yoro was on a designated recovery day as he continues his rehabilitation from a fractured metatarsal. Yoro has been sidelined since he was forced off in United's pre-season friendly defeat to Arsenal on July 26.]\n\nYoro was provisionally due to start for the Under 21s in their National League Cup win at Altrincham last Tuesday but he was withdrawn from the squad.\n\nUnited signed Yoro from Lille for £52.18 million rising to £58.91m in July but he only played 80 minutes in the friendlies with Rangers and Arsenal.\n\nFellow centre back Jonny Evans also did not train as his conditioning is carefully managed. Evans, who turns 37 in January, started at Portman Road and came off early in the second half.\n\n16-year-old centre back Godwill Kukonki trained with United again on Wednesday and the squad welcomed back Harry Maguire (calf) and Lisandro Martinez (back) from injury.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United supporters have written a letter to chief executive Omar Berrada outlining their fury with the club's decision to increase ticket prices, describing the changes as a \"disgrace\".\n\nMembers of the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), the Fan Advisory Board (FAB) and the Fans Forum are putting United's hierarchy under pressure after the price of tickets for each of United's remaining fixtures at Old Trafford this season were increased to £66.\n\nUnited, on Tuesday evening, sent an email to members of the Fans' Forum announcing they had increased ticket prices with immediate effect. All tickets for remaining home games are now priced at £66, regardless of the age of the person buying them.\n\nThe letter has slammed United's decision to hike the ticket prices for young supporters, insisting it is \"scandalous\".\n\nThe full letter said: \"Dear Omar,\n\n\"We write on behalf of the members of the Fans' Forum, Fans' Advisory Board and the Board and Committee of MUST, to protest in the strongest possible terms to the ticket price changes announced on 26 November.\n\n\"These changes are a disgrace, both in their substance and in how the club has gone about making them.\n\n\"First, you are making changes to ticket prices mid-season, with immediate effect. This has never happened before.\n\n\"Secondly, the scale of the increase to individual fans is at a level never seen before - as much as 40 percent increase for adults and 164 percent for kids. The worst aspect of this is the removal of discounts for children and seniors. An Under-17 ticket costing £25 in one of the ends is now £66. A parent taking their child will now pay £132, around double the current price.\n\n\"Surely we can all agree that youngsters going to the game with their parents are the future of the club? And yet, scandalously, it is this very group that will suffer the biggest increases of all. Furthermore, it is of great concern that the club has taken this approach to concessionary tickets and the way these policy changes have been communicated, bearing in mind the Premier League rules that surround these issues.\n\n\"Thirdly, this increase in ticket prices will indisputably have an impact on the 15/19 usage rules. Your conditions state that in order for a resold ticket to be counted as used, the club must be able to re-sell it. Did the club do analysis of how price increases would impact take up for these spare tickets? This is a direct change to Season Ticket policy mid-season which surely has not been explored in terms of its impact. Is it the club's intention to penalise Season Ticket holders who, despite trying to comply, fall afoul of the usage rules?\n\n\"Finally, with the ink barely dry on your recently published Fan Engagement Strategy and despite a consultation protocol agreed in discussions with FAB and MUST (one that explicitly addressed matters of ticketing), the club made this decision without any consultation whatsoever. The manner in which this has been done completely undermines the integrity of the club's fan engagement processes.\n\n\"It adds insult to injury that such an unprecedented and controversial approach has been adopted notwithstanding the meagre returns this programme will yield. This is a clear-cut case of the cure being worse than the disease.\n\n\"Tickets are the access point for match-going supporters. By exploiting them, you risk losing the goodwill and affinity which brings so much added value to the club, not just in support for the team but financially as well, both in terms of fans' discretionary spend and also value for sponsors.\n\n\"The marginal ticket gains in ticket revenue will be outweighed by the loss in these other areas. Compared with our main rivals, United has a proud tradition of fairer pricing, which in turn has helped to generate our huge loyal support over decades. Decisions like this one take this loyalty for granted and put it at risk.\n\n\"The club's announcement of these changes stated that you wish to engage with fans to discuss longer-term changes to tickets and prices. Such engagement can only take place in an environment of mutual trust - and that has been undermined this week. It is as if the club has decided to set fan engagement back to the dark ages. This is unacceptable.\n\n\"There are three things we ask you to do now:\n\n\"Pause these changes until meetings can be held with the FAB and FF to discuss them properly.\n\n\"Re-commit to the principles of consultation the club previously agreed with the FAB, FF and MUST.\n\n\"Establish, in conjunction will all three bodies, the consultation plan that will govern next year's ticketing decisions.\n\n\"We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nThe club declined to comment when approached.",

        "article_headline": "Ruben Amorim could be about to give Alejandro Garnacho a new Manchester United role",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim could be about to give Alejandro Garnacho a new Manchester United role - George Smith - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United head coach Ruben Amorim is likely to continue testing the water over the next few games and weeks.\n\nWhen Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho went to bed on Sunday night, he probably still had Ruben Amorim's voice ringing in his ears.\n\nThe new United head coach spent much of the first half at Portman Road shouting instructions at the 20-year-old, who appeared to be struggling to get to grips with Amorim's new-look system.\n\nThe Argentine international started in attack, lining up on the left of the front-three, but playing in a narrower role than what he has previously been used to.\n\nIn Amorim's 3-4-3 system, United's width is provided by the wing-backs. That was highlighted less than two minutes in when Amad went galloping down the right, beat his man and sent over a cross for Marcus Rashford to turn home.\n\nOn the opposite flank, it was Diogo Dalot who was tasked with charging down the left. United were constantly looking for him and Amad in the wide areas when they picked up the ball.\n\nNaturally, it is going to take United time to adapt to Amorim's methods and demands. It will take weeks, possibly even months, before everything clicks into place and starts to work like clockwork.\n\nWhat was interesting at Portman Road was that Amorim, at half-time, adjusted Garnacho's role, bringing him over to the right flank to ensure he was still on the same side of the pitch as he was stood, making it easier to hand out more instructions. Bruno Fernandes had played on the right in the first 45 minutes.\n\nBefore United had even started travelling to Portman Road for the first time in 22 years, Amorim had already hinted that Garnacho would be starting in one of the forward roles and not as a wing-back, if selected.\n\nHe said: \"We should start with full-backs because to teach a winger how to defend is harder.\"\n\nOn the back of that statement, it was automatically presumed that full-backs Noussair Mazraoui and Dalot would start in the wing-back roles. However, a centre-back shortage meant Mazraoui was roped into playing at right-sided centre-back, forcing Amad to play as the right-sided wing-back.\n\nTo Amad's credit, he did well, making his mark on the game inside the opening two minutes with his assist for Rashford's goal. He did reasonably well defensively, but it is hard to envision him becoming a wing-back long-term.\n\nBut during this period, where United's players are getting to grips with Amorim's methods and rotation is set to be a familiar theme, Amorim is within his rights to experiment.\n\nIt is why the prospect of Garnacho starting as a wing-back against Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford this evening cannot be fully dismissed. United head into the Europa League clash as heavy favourites to scoop all three points.\n\nOf course, United's Europa League campaign to date provides enough evidence to confirm that nothing is a given, but the Reds should have an energy about themselves this evening, likewise a hunger to win their first home game of the Amorim era.\n\nUnited should be striving to get on the front foot this evening and take the game to their Norwegian visitors. United are the big hitters in this season's competition and should be stamping their authority on matches, particularly at home against European minnows.\n\nWith that said, the prospect of testing the water with Garnacho in a wing-back role in a fixture United are expected to control could be a wise experiment. Amorim is likely to conduct several experiments over the coming weeks as he continues to learn more about his players and the way in which they fit into his system.\n\nGarnacho is a crowd-pleasing player who loves to get on the ball and entertain supporters. Amad is cut from a similar cloth.\n\nLong-term, both players should be striving to play in the front line, tasked with scoring and creating goals. In the short term, however, they must be prepared to play in a slightly different habitat, just as Amad did against Ipswich Town.\n\nBut there will be times when they will have to play as wing-backs. Facing inferior opposition at home, on a night where the crowd is likely to be enthused by Amorim's recent arrival, could be the perfect time for Garnacho's audition.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.",

        "article_headline": "'A dream' - Inside Bodo/Glimt's remarkable rise as Man United and Ruben Amorim sent warning",
        "article_text": "Bodø/Glimt take on Manchester United at Old Trafford this evening and are confident of writing the next chapter of their remarkable success story.\n\nBodø/Glimt will arrive at Old Trafford to take on Manchester United this evening as one of European football's biggest success stories.\n\nThe Norwegian champions were only promoted back to the Eliteserien (Norway's top flight) ahead of the 2018 season but they have established themselves as Norway's premier side, continually beating off the challenge of the traditional bigger clubs.\n\nUnder the management of Kjetli Knutsen, Bodø/Glimt have won three of the last four Norwegian titles and have not finished below second in any of the last five seasons. They have also made their mark in Europe, making headlines when they thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 in the 2021/22 Europa Conference League - a competition they reached the quarter-finals of.\n\nBased in the arctic circle, their Aspmyra home stadium has become a fortress. Temperatures become excruciatingly cold in the winter and they play on astro turf, making it an extremely difficult place for opposition sides to visit.\n\nTheir recruitment and development of players is among the best in Europe and despite consistently losing some of their better players, they continue to recover and compete at the top end of Norwegian football. Bayer Leverkusen forward Victor Boniface is one particular example of a player who cut his cloth at the club, and Jans Petter Hauge earned a move to AC Milan.\n\nAnd while United secured the services of one of Europe's brightest managers in Sporting CP coach Ruben Amorim, Bodø/Glimt have their own in Knutsen. The 56-year-old Norwegian has turned down the Ajax job and has been heavily linked with Brighton and Hove Albion in the past.\n\nAs Amorim makes his Old Trafford bow this evening, it will be no surprise if Knutsen has a plan ready to nullify United.\n\n\"Knutsen is a very impressive manager who is able to turn a lot of youngsters into real quality players, with some of them going on to do great things in Europe,\" Matthew and Anker from Football Norway told the Manchester Evening News.\n\n\"He has also taken Norway by storm and although we would love to keep a talented Norwegian manager in Norway, he probably does have bigger ambitions than to only lead Bodø/Glimt to Champions League.\n\n\"Although only the future will tell. He definitely has the capability to potentially manage in the Premier League in the future, but it depends if he really wants it. He turned down Ajax, and never really pushed for anything when linked with Brighton. Maybe he is waiting for the perfect job to come round, whatever that is, or he feels he has unfinished business with Glimt, but who knows.\"\n\nAnd if Knutsen is waiting for the 'perfect job' in England, he will have no bigger audition than taking his team to Old Trafford in the Europa League this evening. It is a huge week in their history, with the trip to Manchester followed by a huge weekend in the Norwegian football calendar.\n\nGlimt head into the final weekend of the Eliteserien one point above their nearest title rivals SK Brann and they just need to better their result when they take on already relegated Lillestrom to win a fourth title in five years. But while the importance of Sunday's game is not lost on them, their trip to United has dominated the headlines in Norway this week.\n\n\"Playing against a Premier League side, especially one as big as Manchester United, makes for a lot of headlines. Going to Old Trafford is a dream for the majority of football fans and players here,\" Matthew and Anker added.\n\n\"The players themselves have also been speaking about how much they're looking forward to the match and getting to play at Old Trafford. The only way I can put the excitement and feeling into perspective is if a lower league club in England drew United away in the FA Cup. It’s a massive deal.\"\n\nSuch has been Glimt's success, they actually head to Manchester one point and three positions above United in the expanded Europa League table after wins over Porto and Braga and are on course to qualify for the knockout rounds.\n\nA win at Old Trafford would move them four points clear of United and leave Amorim's side scrapping to qualify for the next stage of the competition. And while they acknowledge their underdog tags, there is a quiet confidence they could spring a surprise in Amorim's first game in charge at Old Trafford.\n\n\"For Bodø/Glimt, Manchester United is a great team with a great history,\" the pair concluded. \"However, they are a team that is struggling to find form and right now might not be at their greatest point. So if there ever was a time to believe you can beat Manchester United at Old Trafford, it's now.\n\n\"Bodø/Glimt is a team that plays with a lot of confidence and as we previously mentioned about it being a huge game for the players, so they will be really up for it. It just depends if they can not get ‘overwhelmed’ by the magnitude of it all - like they did earlier this season when they played Red Star Belgrade in the final Champions League qualifying game.",

It is a huge responsibility, but I have the clear sense that everyone involved with Manchester United is so hungry and determined to succeed. The unique history of this club is known around the world but, when I arrived in Manchester, I took the Old Trafford tour and it gave me a feeling that I want everyone to have: to remember who we are, and what that means. Our history must inspire us.\n\n\"We must be excited by the opportunity to write a new chapter. Every player and member of staff here has the ability to contribute to that mission, and there is far more potential here than the season so far has suggested.\n\n\"Now, I cannot fix this situation alone, and neither can any of the players or staff. This is not about any individual at the club. This is about what we can become together by working hard, enjoying ourselves and having no fear. I must say that, for all the potential inside the club, I believe one of the greatest weapons of Manchester United is the fanbase.\n\n\"I have been to Old Trafford as a player and I have felt what can happen when you face United's players and fans together, so I know from experience that if we all work as one, back each other and give our all to each game, there is no limit to what we can achieve.\n\n\"Last Sunday, we travelled to Ipswich Town. A draw was, of course, not the result we wanted, but I was pleased with the intent of the players, who showed how open they were to our new approach, despite only having two training sessions together.\n\n\"Since we now have four months until the next international break, we have to maximise every minute on the training pitch and every game. The time we have together provides opportunities to grow together, starting tonight as we host Kjetil Knutsen and his Bodo/Glimt players in the Europa League.\n\n\"Our first aim, of course, is to win the game.

The calf issue has meant Maguire has sat out of their last five Premier League outings - including Erik ten Hag's final matches in the dugout before Ruud van Nistelrooy took charge on a temporary basis with Ruben Amorim succeeding him shortly after.\n\nIt's a welcome boost for the newly-appointed Portuguese head coach who has been without some key defensive figures in his early United tenure. Argentine Lisandro Martinez has also been sidelined after suffering a back issue on the eve of the November international break, summer signing Leny Yoro is still awaiting his debut after picking up a problem in pre-season.\n\nMaguire wrote on Instagram: \"Back out there with the lads.\"\n\nAmorim declared that Martinez is back in content with Maguire also on the comeback trail as he welcomes back players from the treatment table. The former Sporting boss may see a return from Martinez and Maguire for their Europa League tie against Bodo/Glimt.\n\n\"Licha is ready to play, Harry [Maguire] is returning, that's a good thing,\" he said on Wednesday. \"Leny Yoro is improving his fitness, Luke [Shaw] is healthy.

        "article_text": "Manchester United's former interim head coach Ruud van Nistelrooy could be set for an immediate return to the Premier League\n\nManchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly eyeing one of Erik ten Hag's former assistants to be his number two at Leicester City.\n\nVan Nistelrooy was appointed as assistant to Ten Hag in the summer after Mitchell van der Gaag and Steve McClaren both left the club. United also managed the coup of adding Go Ahead Eagles' manager Rene Hake to their backroom staff, with Ten Hag a long term admirer of his work, as Ineos looked to revitalise their coaches.\n\nUnfortunately for Ten Hag, this fresh lease of life lasted merely a matter of a couple of months as a historically poor start to the season culminated with the Dutchman being sacked by the board at the end of October. Van Nistelrooy was kept on as interim alongside Hake until November 11 when Ruben Amorim became head coach.\n\nThe Portuguese's arrival led to the departure of Ten Hag's coaches but Van Nistelrooy does not look like he will have been unemployed for long. It is being widely reported that the former PSV Eindhoven manager will be returning to the Premier League with the Foxes after they sacked Steve Cooper last weekend.\n\nAccording to The Times, Van Nistelrooy could be looking to add Hake to his coaching team ahead of his appointment at the King Power Stadium. However, there is no word on whether the former striker will be looking to add Jelle ten Rouwelaar or Pieter Morel to his team after they joined the duo out of United earlier this month.\n\nIf Van Nistelrooy was to be appointed Leicester manager, he would be reunited with United on March 15 when the Reds travel to the East Midlands in the Premier League. During his spell in interim charge, Van Nistelrooy masterminded two big victories over the Foxes in both the Premier League and Carabao Cup.",

He is now one of the indisputable starters for head coach Bruno Lage, alongside former Manchester City star Nicolas Otamendi.\n\nAs Amorim looks to build a squad of his own at Old Trafford, The Sun reports a meeting is set to take place with the club on Friday, which will involve discussing a potential move for Araujo. United have been dealing with a number of injuries in defence this campaign.\n\nAraujo, who has previously been targeted by Crystal Palace and Paris Saint-Germain last summer, is thought to fit the profile Amorim is looking for. At the time, Benfica bosses rejected the move and it's said that clubs are 'closely monitoring' the situation.\n\nThe report adds that Araujo has been placed on Amorim's wishlist but whether the Reds will approach Benfica over a transfer in the New Year remains to be seen. He won't come cheap however, as he has a €100million (£83m) release clause attached to his contract.\n\nAraujo's former youth coach at Benfica, Renato Paiva, has previously praised the centre-back's development. \"I said that Tomas and Ruben Dias were the most complete central defenders that I had trained,\" he told A Bola.\n\n\"I even said that Tomas' technical quality and game perception could make him a central midfielder because he could have immense ability both as a central defender and as a central midfielder. It's one of Tomás' greatest attributes, his serenity, sometimes excessive - sometimes it was his only 'sin'.\n\n\"I felt he was still a little soft, not aggressive enough to be a central defender. He has speed, construction, intelligence, he knows how to behave, he's humble... Things are coming together and that's a good thing.\"",

The Reds welcome Bodo Glimt in the Europa League seeking a victory to bolster their qualification chances.\n\nUnited are 15th in the expanded table, three points adrift of a top eight spot that would put them straight into the last 16.\n\nAnd while the Norwegian visitors are not household names, they are above United in the standings and should not be under-estimated. They are top of their domestic league and are 2023 champions.\n\nThey also possess some English league experience in Philip Zinckernagel who played for Watford and Nottingham Forest. Indeed he made his debut in English football at Old Trafford, starting for Watford in a 1-0 reverse to United in January 2021.\n\nA little under four years on he will be back. None of the XI who lined up for the Reds that day are still at the club and United are undergoing their latest new era. For Zinckernagel, on loan at Bodo/Glimt from Club Brugges, he will be hoping to make an impact at the home of one of his football heroes.\n\nThe Dane grew up idolising David Beckham. He was his football hero and he would love nothing more than to find the net in front of a huge Old Trafford crowd just like his hero did on so many occasions.\n\nHe perhaps still harbours ambitions of playing in the top flight, something that didn't materialise during his spell with the Hornets. He is now 29 and thriving back at Bodo/Glimt in an attacking midfield role but capable of playing across midfield.\n\nHe always had the drive to succeed, as his dad Torben, speaking to The Athletic in 2022, explained: “When he first started playing, he was on it and was always super disciplined. He was always a very talented footballer. He didn’t care about parties and always did the right thing, and followed the rules.\n\n\"Then there was a shift in his early twenties when he started to work with his mental coach and they started to instil more perspective on what he wanted to achieve and that changed his game completely, and he only headed in one direction.”\n\nThe next staging post in Zinckernagel's career could be celebrating at Old Trafford, even if Amorim and the United fans will hope otherwise.",

(Image: Martin Rickett/PA Wire)\n\nManchester United have revealed the total cost of the recent managerial change at Old Trafford, with it potentially impacting on the January transfer budget.\n\nUnited confirmed the sacking of Erik ten Hag back in October, following the Premier League loss in July. The decision came just months after the Dutchman put pen to paper on a new contract.\n\nThe club’s latest financial report now reveals that it cost a total of £10.4 million to pay off Ten Hag and members of his coaching staff. Ruud van Nistelrooy took charge of four games on an interim basis amid the search for a new head coach, but he was among those to leave following the appointment of Ruben Amorim.\n\nThe arrival of the former Sporting CP boss as well as his backroom staff has cost approximately £11 million, according to the report. The Portuguese coach had a €10 million (£8.4m) release clause in his Sporting contract which United triggered, with other costs likely to be on the backroom staff.\n\nIt means, in total, the managerial change cost United £21.4 million. Given the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability rules, that could potentially be taken into account when Amorim is given a transfer budget for the upcoming January window.\n\nAmorim’s arrival at United was confirmed at the start of the month, but he didn’t officially join until November 11. He took charge of his first game last weekend with United drawing 1-1 with newly-promoted Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\n\nUnited are back in action tonight (Thursday) when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Premier League (8pm kick-off). It will be the new head coach’s first home game in charge of the club.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.",

        "article_text": "Jamie Carragher commented on Real Madrid's ongoing interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold after Liverpool maintained their unbeaten run in the Champions League – and Thierry Henry was left stunned.\n\nLiverpool produced a scintillating performance against defending champions Madrid on Wednesday night as goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo secured their place in the Champions League knockout phase.\n\nIt was a superb team performance from Arne Slot's side, who made Los Blancos look distinctly average at Anfield, but one of the standout performers was right-back Conor Bradley.\n\nIn the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bradley not only recorded an assist but completed four tackles and eight duels. He also won possession back nine times against Carlo Ancelotti's side.\n\nIn fact, no player in the Champions League has recorded higher figures across those categories in a match this season, according to Opta.\n\nAfter the full-time whistle, Jamie Carragher made a comment about the Northern Ireland international that grabbed many people's attention, including fellow pundit Thierry Henry.\n\nSpeaking on CBS Sports, Carragher said: “Coming into this game, there’s been a lot of talk about Real Madrid looking to buy Liverpool’s right back. But, I’m not sure if that player is called Trent Alexander-Arnold or Conor Bradley.”\n\nClearly taken by surprise, Henry replied: “Wow!”\n\nHenry was full of praise for Bradley, especially after his crunching tackle on Kylian Mbappe in the first-half.\n\n“That (tackle), for me, already did set the tone,” Henry told CBS Sports. “Boom! That’s it. You all know, when you go into someone like that at the beginning of the game, you’re going to struggle.\n\n“We see him making that run every time, he fancied it. You could see, he fancied himself against Mbappe.\n\n“Everything he did was spot on. We were waiting for Salah, we were waiting for Mbappe, but we saw Conor Bradley so fair play to him.”\n\nHenry added: “Conor Bradley was just outstanding. I think he didn’t have to do a lot defensively because Mbappe didn’t do a lot offensively, so it became very easy.\n\n“But the positions he takes right now, what he can do and how he understands when he needs to make that run…\n\n“The assist (for the opener) was not a Trent Alexander-Arnold assist, in all fairness, but still, he is where he is supposed to be.”\n\nAlexander-Arnold, meanwhile, continues to be linked with a move to Real Madrid.\n\nLiverpool are keen to initiate contract negotiations with the player, who has made over 300 appearances for his boyhood club, but reports in Spain suggest the defender's entourage have held discussions with Madrid over a potential transfer.",

        "article_headline": "Roy Keane shakes Ricky Gervais' hand after they agree on what they want banned forever",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane shook hands with Ricky Gervais on a recent podcast after the comedian started a debate on what he wants banned from existence.\n\nGervais, who is best known for creating shows like The Office, An Idiot Abroad and After Life, appeared on Thursday's episode of Stick To Football with Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott and Ian Wright.\n\nHe was also joined by former Manchester United captain Roy Keane, who recently criticised his noisy neighbours over using a leaf blower in the early hours.\n\nIn fact, Keane believes it should be illegal to use them before 8am. \"I took my dog out this morning at 7:15 and where I live and someone is on the blower with the leaves at quarter past seven in the morning,\" Keane said.\n\n\"It's a disgrace. I think it should be banned. I was gonna go over and say 'people are in bed!' You're not allowed to use them. It's 8 o'clock.\"\n\nJust weeks after Keane's outburst and Gervais happened to bring up his hatred of leaf blowers, which brought a rare handshake from the former Republic of Ireland international.\n\nHere's how the conversation played out on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet.\n\nGervais: \"I want to ban leaf blowers. Why have they got leaf blowers? What are they doing? They're blowing leaves into the street. Well... they are going to blow back!\"\n\nKeane: *shakes hand*\n\nJill Scott: \"The last episode, he spoke about leaf blowers for about half an hour.\"\n\nGervais: \"Honestly I want to go to the council and ask them to ban leaf blowers. It's bad for the environment. It's noisy. It's pointless.\"\n\nKeane: \"The bit that annoys me is, one [person] does it, and he blows the leaves down there... and then the other guy, he's a gardener, blows them f*****g back to where they were. They just keep doing it every day.\"\n\nGervais: \"What's up with a rake and putting it in a bag? Or get a vacuum.\"\n\nAfter his appearance on the podcast, Gervais joked about Keane's recent confrontation with an Ipswich Town fan.\n\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, the comedian wrote: \"I’m just glad Roy didn’t want to chat to me in the car park.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Sunday's Premier League clash between Manchester United and Ipswich, a furious Keane was spotted confronting a supporter during an ad break.\n\nFootage soon emerged of the heated incident, where Keane can be heard telling the supporter: \"I’ll wait for you in the car park and we can discuss it.\"",

At Old Trafford’s trinity statue the United fan group FC58, Everton supporters and Fans Supporting Foodbanks representatives will display a Stop Exploiting Loyalty banner. This will be mirrored at Anfield, where from 3pm the Spirit of Shankly group and Liverpool fans will gather by the Fans Supporting Foodbanks collection point with the City 1894 group and MCFC Fans Foodbank Support.\n\nA statement from the groups said: “Banners inside and outside the grounds will highlight a shared message: enough is enough – stop exploiting loyalty. Fan groups from all four clubs are joining to support the Football Supporters’ Association’s #StopExploitingLoyalty campaign, which highlights soaring ticket prices, the erosion of concessionary rates, and above-inflation increases that are pricing out the very people who form the backbone of English football culture.\n\n“It comes in the same week the Premier League’s new broadcast rights deal rose by 17% to a staggering £12.25bn, further diminishing the significance of general admission ticket income to clubs’ finances. Yet, despite this, all but one Premier League club raised ticket prices last season, and this week [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) announced that all new tickets for children and older fans at Old Trafford will increase to £66.\n\n“There is also growing concern that some clubs are now targeting the £30 cap on away tickets in the Premier League, threatening to dismantle one of the last safeguards for fans, many of whom make multiple financial sacrifices to continue supporting their club. Football does not have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem – and loyal supporters should not bear the cost.”\n\nOn Wednesday [the Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/manchester-united-raise-member-ticket-prices-remove-concessions) United’s raising of ticket prices was part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s drive to make the club more financially sustainable.",

His last game was a home defeat against his predecessor, Enzo Maresca, now in charge of the high-flying Chelsea.\n\nLeicester were interested in Graham Potter and Carlos Corberán before installing Cooper in the summer but this week the club held productive talks with Van Nistelrooy. The club were reluctant to pay compensation for a manager, making him an attractive option.\n\nVan Nistelrooy previously had a short spell managing PSV Eindhoven, the club where he made his big breakthrough as a player, winning the Dutch Cup in 2023 before resigning, citing a lack of support within the club.\n\nLeicester are 16th in the table, one point above the relegation zone. The Dutchman’s first game could be at Brentford on Saturday, before matches against West Ham, Brighton, Newcastle, and Wolves.\n\nLeicester’s players returned to training after a Christmas party in Copenhagen, where players were filmed dancing at a nightclub in front of a sign that read: “Enzo I miss you.”\n\nVan Nistelrooy joined United as an assistant coach in July but was appointed interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag and oversaw four games, winning three, drawing one.\n\nTwo of Van Nistelrooy’s wins in the United dugout came against Leicester, with a 5-2 win in the Carabao Cup before a 3-0 league victory in his final match in caretaker charge.",

Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nMarcus Rashford ‘has to really want it’ to return to top form, says Ruben Amorim\n================================================================================\n\n*   Forward has scored five goals in 19 games this season\n*   Amorim keen for all attacking players to improve output\n\nRuben Amorim believes Marcus Rashford has to “really want it” if the forward is to recapture his 30-goal Manchester United form of two seasons ago.\n\nRashford scored after two minutes of United’s 1-1 draw at Ipswich on Sunday, Amorim’s first game in charge, but this was only his fifth goal in 19 appearances. Last term Rashford scored only eight goals in 43 games, having registered a career-high 30 in the previous campaign.\n\nAmorim was asked what was required for Rashford to return to his best. “He has to be the first one to really want it,” the head coach said. “Then, he will have the help of all the staff and fans. He has to be Marcus – he is a Manchester United boy.”\n\nRashford operated as the central striker in Amorim’s 3-4-3 at Ipswich but has stated he prefers to play wide left. “That position [against Ipswich] is not the best one for him,” Amorim said. “Especially in a game like that, he was fighting with two giants [the centre-backs] and we will try to find the right solution for him.”\n\nAmorim said Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Højlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad Diallo also need to score more. United have only 13 league goals and 32 from 19 games in all competitions. He said: “There is a concern [about this] but we have to improve as a team, we have quality players that can score so many goals. You can feel in the second half we controlled possession of the ball but were not dangerous.\n\n“We will try to improve as a team, Rasmus and Rash and even Bruno to score more goals, Amad. All these guys need to improve, we can score so many goals. I don’t need new strikers to score – we can improve as a team.”\n\nAmorim was asked whether he would ever deviate from 3-4-3 to, for example, a back four. “We’ll do it – we have to do it,” he said. “And when I talk about our structure, I believe we can play in different systems. So we defend more in this game [Ipswich], sometimes in a 4-4-2, because Amad [the right wing-back] was with [their] left-back. So we want to put the structure in place, and then we have to play in different systems. Nowadays every team changes the dynamics. So we will adapt that.”\n\nHarry Maguire and Lisandro Martínez are available after injury for Thursday’s visit of Bodø/Glimt for the fifth Europa League group game. United are 15th with six points.",

      "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nHow did last week's team do?\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m\n\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, £6m\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\nLewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\nDwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\nJoao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\nBernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\nLucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\nIbrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\nBrighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

      "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\nNeil Johnston\nBBC Sport journalist in Lisbon\nPublished 2 November 2024\nUpdated 21 November 2024\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\"\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"",

      "article_text": "Lille’s Angel Gomes has forged an unconventional path to the England team.\n\nHailed as a wonderkid by supporters of his boyhood club Manchester United, Gomes seemed destined for greatness at Old Trafford.\n\nHe made his debut under Jose Mourinho aged 16 but just three years' later was walking away from the club with tears in his eyes.\n\nFrustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities, Gomes rejected a new deal, making the \"difficult\" choice to leave to \"better myself as a player and person\".\n\nHe joined Lille in 2020 - and was immediately sent on a season-long loan to Portuguese team Boavista - before returning to the French side.\n\nThe move has allowed him to quietly improve his game while remaining on England's radar.\n\nGomes, who was part of the Under-17s World Cup winning squad from 2017, was also involved in the triumphant 2023 Under-21s European Championship side under Lee Carsley.\n\nSix of that team, including Gomes, were then selected by Carsley after he became interim manager of the senior squad, for September’s Uefa Nations League wins over the Republic of Ireland and Finland.\n\nNow, aged 24, Gomes has four senior caps and hopes to build on his progress under new manager Thomas Tuchel but should senior recognition have come sooner?\n\n\"When he was called up by England, we were like ‘have they never watched him play? Why has it taken them so long?'\" French football writer Julien Laurens told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We’ve seen for the past three years how good he is. It felt right that he finally got his chance.\"\n\nWhile Gomes' England selection caught many by surprise, it perhaps shouldn't have done.\n\nGomes is now into his fourth season in Lille’s first-team squad. In that time, he has also played in the Champions League and Conference League.\n\n\"He’s one of the best players in Ligue 1, there’s no doubt,\" added Laurens.\n\n\"The fans love him; a player that you enjoy watching because he’s just so elegant, so creative, such a great touch.\n\n\"If you know your football, you know that teams need players like Angel Gomes that make everything click and make everything happen.\"\n\nThe Salford-raised midfielder was highly rated at youth level, with England and Manchester United.\n\n\"Angel was always spoken about highly because he’s quality as a player,\" Jonathan Panzo, who is on loan at Portuguese Primeira Liga side Rio Ave from Nottingham Forest, told BBC Sport when recalling the first time he trained with Gomes.\n\n\"You hear about someone, then you get to see it and you are like 'they weren’t lying about this player’.\n\n\"He is definitely one of the best players I have played with.\"\n\nGomes’ crowning moment in youth football came in 2017 when England won the Under-17s World Cup in India.\n\nManaged by Leicester City boss Steve Cooper, the team included Manchester City's Phil Foden, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, Chelsea’s Jadon Sancho and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.\n\n\"It was so special,\" Joel Latibeaudiere, England’s captain in India who now plays for Coventry City, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"On the pitch, he creates goals \\[and\\] chances. Also, I think he has a massive effect off the pitch in terms of keeping the camp bubbly.\n\n\"Seven weeks with the same group of people can be tough and keeping that camaraderie going can be tough.\"\n\n\"He is down to earth,\" added Panzo, also a World Cup winner in India. \"He gets his head down, works hard, is humble. That’s what I love about him, he never changes.\"\n\nBefore success in India, Gomes had already made his Premier League debut, becoming United’s youngest player since Duncan Edwards in 1953.\n\nHe went on to make 10 first-team appearances for United before being released at the end of the 2019-20 season after failing to agree terms on a new contract.\n\nAfter Gomes' release, he signed a five-year contract with Lille and immediately went on a season-long loan to Boavista in Portugal. He played 30 of Boavista's 34 league games, starting 29 times.\n\n\"What French clubs are very good at, especially clubs like Lille who are maybe not the top, \\[is\\] keeping tabs on really good young talents around Europe,\" Laurens explained.\n\n\"If you faced an Angel Gomes in youth football and you are impressed, he stays in your scouting data. If it doesn’t work out at Manchester United or somewhere else, then you know exactly what his qualities are and the talent he has.\n\n\"I remember when they signed him, they really could not believe that they were able to.\"\n\nSince Gomes' return to Lille, he has been a mainstay, making 126 appearances.\n\nDuring his United days, Gomes was mainly an attacking midfielder. Now, he has the ability to play in a range of central midfield roles.\n\n\"His technical ability really is great,\" Laurens explained. \"He’s got amazing vision, he sees the game before everybody else.\n\n\"It’s a profile that England don't produce much and \\[the\\] 10 \\[position\\] is maybe where you get the most out of him because he’s so creative playing behind the striker, he will shine.\"\n\n\"He's like a magician,\" said Panzo. \"He's a small player, but his IQ is so smart and he just knows how to get around the pitch.\"\n\n\"The thing that makes \\[Gomes\\] stand out the most is his build and how he can dominate a role in which a lot of people think you need a big stature,\" Latibeaudiere added.\n\n\"What he's really improved on is almost controlling the game. He's \\[now playing\\] in a deeper role so his understanding of the game has seemed to improve a lot because \\[in\\] that role, you are the one that dictates play \\[and\\] the tempo.\"\n\nGomes' rise comes in a new era for England's national team.\n\nLast week's Nations League fixtures against Greece and the Republic of Ireland were the last under Carsley before Tuchel takes charge.\n\nIt is also a big season for Gomes off the pitch.\n\nHis contract is set to expire next summer and Lille may struggle to retain Gomes now his quality has become widely-appreciated. He's been linked with a switch to Tottenham Hotspur in January and even with a return to Manchester United.\n\n\"Ideally Lille would want him to extend and let him go in the summer for a bit of money,\" Laurens said. \"I doubt that he will sign an extension.\"\n\nBut what is Gomes’ ceiling?\n\n\"He can go as high as he wants,\" Latibeaudiere said.\n\n\"He made a great decision to go to Portugal when he did and get minutes under his belt. Making the move to France \\[was\\] another great decision.\n\n\"I'm so happy to see him step up onto the international stage as well.\"",

      "article_text": "Leny Yoro is fully fit and gearing up for his Man United debut under new head coach Ruben Amorim this month.\n\nLeny Yoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night.\n\nYoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left.\n\nYoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91 million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City.\n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now.\n\nShaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

      "headline": "Manchester United team news as Ruben Amorim gets set for his first game in charge, against Ipswich Town on Sunday",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era. Amorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\n\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford. After fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans. If he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country. The 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho. \n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n**Rashford up top**\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign. Rasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible. In his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.",

      "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United since February 18. Both are now back in full training. Full backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo, and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

      "headline": "Manchester United make Sekou Kone plan after midfielder's injury scare",
      "article_text": "Sekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad fresh off a busy summer of spending but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s. \n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nEqually, with Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure, and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer-term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.",

He can hold the ball, he can play with the one or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is a big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals.

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.”",

Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

      "article_text": "TalkSPORT presenter Andy Goldstein has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard surrounding Manchester City's 115 charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nCity's charges relate largely to Premier League rules, although a minority of them relate to UEFA.\n\nA hearing into the charges is currently being held in private, meaning little information has been released to the public. After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper. I've heard they're going to be found not guilty of all of them [the charges].\n\n\"It's just a whisper, it's unconfirmed. It's some bloke down the pub telling me, that sort of level.\n\n\"Listen, it's just a whisper. I was the first person to say Declan Rice is going to Arsenal. There's footage of me saying that from around a year before it happened, from a reliable source.\"\n\nCo-host Darren Bent did joke that the 'reliable source' was perhaps more reliable than Goldstein's City 'whisper'.\n\nSPORTbible has contacted the Premier League for comment.\n\nWhat are the 115 charges against Manchester City?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow, in full, are the 115 charges levelled against Manchester City by the Premier League and UEFA.\n\n*   **Failure to provide accurate and up-to-date financial information from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 54 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations from December 2018-present [February 2023] -** 35 alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to provide accurate financial reports for player and manager compensation from 2009/10 to and including 2017/18 -** 14 alleged breaches\n*   **Breaches of Premier League profitability and sustainability regulations from 2015/16 to and including 2017/18 -** Seven alleged breaches\n*   **Failure to comply with UEFA's regulations, including UEFA's Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play regulations -** Five alleged breaches",

      "article_text": "Manchester City are ready to offer Erling Haaland a so-called 'mega' deal that would make him the highest paid player in Premier League history.\n\nThe 24-year-old striker, who has scored 105 goals in 114 games for City, including 16 this season, is currently in talks with the Premier League champions over a new big-money contract worth £500,000 per-week.\n\nThat's according to The Mirror, who suggest that his 'basic salary' would eclipse the Premier League's second-highest paid player, Kevin De Bruyne, who is currently on £400,000 per-week.\n\nHaaland has yet to put pen-to-paper as an 'issue' around his £150 million release clause continues to be a stumbling block, but there has been a positive response to recent negotiations.\n\nManchester City, meanwhile, are hoping that Pep Guardiola's decision to sign a one-year contract extension will help get Haaland's reported £100 million deal over the line.\n\nThat's according to The Sun, who suggest a contract extension would see Haaland remain at City for four or five more years, meaning he could potentially earn in the region of £100 million without bonuses.\n\nLast week, before Guardiola penned his contract extension, Haaland said: “I hope Pep signs a new contract. He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

      "headline": "Man Utd 'make contact' with European giants for first January signing as Ruben Amorim stamps his mark",
      "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up. If you let up, it's over, then you'll go under.\"",

      "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
      "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\"\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n“If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option.

Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past; the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

      "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins, and a Champions League, as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10.’ However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9,’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it, no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap. “When I went to Manchester United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained. “Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay with my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager, when Eric Cantona left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks (David Beckham).”\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers were expecting a more complex answer, but the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder’s simplicity had them laughing. De Rossi, who is a long-time admirer of Keane, credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

      "article_text": "Liverpool fans have made their mind up about Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid after seeing what just appeared in the Spanish capital.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, 26, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be able to start talks with foreign clubs from January 1, 2025.\n\nThe Liverpool man has played an integral part in the club's early season success under new boss Arne Slot - the Reds currently sit top of the Premier League and 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, arguably the biggest negative surrounding the club is the contractual situation of Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, and Virgil van Dijk – all three are out of contract at the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nAlthough there is no doubting the ability of Van Dijk and Salah, the ages – 33 and 32, respectively – of the players could be a sticking point in contract negotiations.\n\nHowever, with Alexander-Arnold at 26 and arguably approaching his peak, losing him, especially without receiving a transfer fee, would be far from ideal for the Reds.\n\nAlthough the situation is still unclear, Liverpool supporters were shocked when they came across a giant advert of the player in Madrid, posted to X by Anfield Wrap.\n\nThe Liverpool defender was pictured alongside model and actress Iris Law for a shoot for fashion brand 'Guess' on a billboard, which was emblazoned on the side of a building located at Plaza Felipe II – the place where thousands of Liverpool fans gathered ahead of their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final held in the city.\n\nFans were quick to offer their thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOne fan said: “If he goes, he goes, [it] won't go down well with LFC fans if he walks away for nothing. I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus. We’ve always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it. And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

      "article_text": "Liverpool are ‘planning’ a move for an in-form Premier League forward – but they may have to compete with a rival to sign the player.\n\nLiverpool have started the season in excellent fashion, with new manager Arne Slot seeing his side pick up 15 wins in his first 17 games in charge of the Reds.\n\nThe Merseyside-based side also sit top of both the Premier League and the 36-team Champions League group phase.\n\nHowever, one of the first challenges faced by Slot when he arrived was the lack of new players coming into the club during the summer transfer window.\n\nJust Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili were recruited, with the Georgian ‘keeper instantly loaned back to Valencia until the end of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nThe Reds tried and failed to sign Real Sociedad ‘number six’ Martin Zubimendi, but so far, Ryan Gravenberch has performed well in the role.\n\nDespite most things currently being positive at the club, the only real negatives are the contractual situations Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk find themselves in – all three are out of contract at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, the club are now ‘weighing’ up a move for the Egyptian's potential replacement, according to The Sun.\n\nLiverpool are thought to be keen on Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, 25, who has been in impressive form, having already netted eight goals in 11 appearances for the Bees this term.\n\nMbeumo is most comfortable playing as a right forward/winger, which happens to be the position Salah takes up in the Liverpool side.\n\nBut Slot’s side may be in for some tough competition to sign the player as Newcastle United have been ‘watching’ the player, who is said to be highly regarded by Magpies’ boss Eddie Howe.\n\nThe report suggests the Tynesiders may be willing to offer Callum Wilson as part of a potential £50m deal, but it is still unclear if talks are underway between either of the clubs.\n\nBack in May 2024, the France-born Cameroon international admitted he would like to play at the “best clubs”.\n\n“I have spent five years at Brentford, at a club that has allowed me to grow and pass a milestone, but yes, I would like to play in the biggest competitions, at the best clubs,\" he said in an interview with L’Equipe.\n\n\"It is tantalising to see some big clubs interested in me. We will see [about a transfer].\"\n\nThe 25-year-old’s current Brentford contract is set to run until June 2026.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has opened up on the regret that his wife \"throws in my face every day\".\n\nThe 39-year-old, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday as the Reds come up against Ipswich Town, has enjoyed a remarkable rise since taking over at third-tier Portuguese sider Casa Pia in 2018.\n\nHe went on to impress at Braga, the club he spent a year at during his playing career, before Sporting triggered the €10 million (£8.3m) clause in his contract. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age of 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n“I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT. \"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

      "headline": "Man Utd have player who is 'impossible to ignore' as Ruben Amorim told to take immediate action",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been told about a player in the Manchester United ranks who is \"impossible to ignore\" as he prepares to take charge of his first game. After succeeding Erik ten Hag as the next United head coach, Amorim has some big decisions to make in the coming months when it comes to team selection. Amad Diallo is set for a 'prominent' role under the new manager, according to journalist Dean Jones, who says Amorim is 'excited' by the winger's technical ability, work off the ball, and creativity in the final third. We will get more of an insight into his thinking on Sunday afternoon, when United travel to Portman Road to take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town. But ahead of the Premier League clash, Amorim has been urged to take a look at one of their academy prospects. Earlier this week, United under-21s maintained their unbeaten record in the National League Cup with a 4-0 win over Altrincham as highly-rated striker Ethan Ennis scored a hat-trick. Ennis, who joined the Reds from Liverpool in 2021, becoming the first player in 57 years to do so, has netted nine goals and two assists in 12 academy appearances this season. And the 19-year-old forward has been tipped to push for a spot in the first-team by Steven Railston of the Manchester Evening News. \"So what you might be wondering, could Ennis be pushing to make his first-team debut? The answer is he should be,\" he said. \"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first-team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\" Ennis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. Back in August, the MEN reported: \"He will continue to be an integral U21 player and could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.\"",

      "article_text": "A former Premier League player who fans believed to be behind the masked rapper Dide has finally addressed the claims.\n\nBack in April 2023, a rapper claiming to be a Premier League footballer posted a new single titled, 'Thrill' and had fans engrossed in the mystery of his identity.\n\nThe artist always wears a rose mask in videos and fans quickly worked out that the rapper hails from London as they put their detective hats on. Dide has been able to keep things under wraps but has pulled back the curtain ever so slightly, opening up about how he balances being a football and musician at the same time.\n\nIn April he said Kevin De Bruyne is the best player he has played against before claiming his teammates and manager had no idea about his hustle on the side.\n\nEddie Nketiah, Wilfried Zaha, Reiss Nelson and Alex Iwobi were just some of the many suggestions fans have come up with but some also 'outed' Sheyi Ojo, who Liverpool bought for a fee of £2 million when he was just 14.\n\nOjo, a member of England's Under 20 World Cup-winning squad in 2017, played 13 times for the Reds and left for Cardiff City in 2022 after a number of loan spells, including Wolves, Fulham, Rangers and Reims.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Slovenian side NK Maribor in September but in a new interview with The Athletic, Ojo was asked if he is actually Dide.\n\nAnd he was happy to dismiss talk of it being him as he would not be one to put \"anything else in the picture to sway my concentration\".\n\n\"It’s funny because everywhere I go people ask me about it but honestly I haven’t got a clue who it is,\" Ojo said.\n\n\"All I can say is I’m super focused on football as I always have been, that’s pretty much the only thing that matters to me. I wouldn’t be putting anything else in the picture to sway my concentration, it’s definitely not something I’m involved in but I understand everyone’s curiosities.\"\n\nA year ago Aston Villa and Belgium midfielder Amadou Onana, then at Everton, claimed he knew Dide's real identify but could not possibly disclose it due to a \"code\".\n\n\"There has been some rumours but there is a player code that I can't break,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"People try to get it out of my mouth but I won't.\"",

      "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017. He showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. The player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

      "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
      "article_text": "Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?\n\n1\n\nDewsbury-Hall back on familiar ground\nAfter masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.\n\n2\n\nO’Riley can be pivotal to Brighton\nMatt O’Riley endured a tough start to his Brighton career when he suffered an ankle injury caused by a poor challenge nine minutes into his debut in the Carabao Cup against Crawley. The midfielder missed the following three months but showed his worth on his return to help transform the game against Manchester City and score the winner. Fabian Hürzeler and Brighton earmarked O’Riley as the man required in midfield to sit alongside Carlos Baleba, who has been struggling with a knee problem, and they could be paired from the start at Bournemouth. Brighton have not missed O’Riley much, starting the weekend in sixth. Baleba is 20 and O’Riley 24, meaning they could be a long-term partnership. That is not often the way at Brighton but if they perform as hoped the pair could provide the foundation for another push for European football while increasing their value.\n\n3\n\nCan Forest repeat Anfield heist?\nArsenal have picked up two points from 12 available over the past four games and are in a tricky spot. The prospect of facing the side immediately below them, who are yet to lose away all season, is a daunting one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have defeated Liverpool this season, proving they have the cunning and quality to topple title contenders. At Anfield, Forest’s success came about by packing the midfield and stopping Liverpool from playing with fluidity. It would seem Nuno might do similar to prevent Martin Ødegaard from pulling the strings. Forest’s manager has proven his intelligence when it comes to stifling opponents, while possessing a potent attacking threat. After losing to Newcastle, Nuno will want a reaction from his players. If he can get it to resemble the performance at Anfield he could be managing a top-four team by Saturday evening.\n\n4\n\nWill Villa’s miserable month continue?\nA winless month – including four consecutive defeats – has taken the wind out of Aston Villa’s sails. Such patterns are not unknown for Unai Emery; his teams can blow hot and cold. That grim run has betrayed the fatigue of coming so far so fast and suggested that opposition managers may be cracking the Villa code. Emery’s high-risk football, when it falters, can often look one-dimensional as Villa did in successive chastening defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. With Ollie Watkins making an international breakthrough, and Morgan Rogers getting his first cap, Emery will hope for a lift in morale. Oliver Glasner, with fewer resources at Crystal Palace than Emery, has hit on similar problems, having initially been so successful last season. It still comes as a surprise to see Palace in the bottom three. Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton recovering fitness and form could be key for the Austrian manager.\n\n5\n\nEverton need to freshen up their game\nThis could be the final home game of the dreadful Farhad Moshiri era for Everton, with the Friedkin Group hoping that Premier League approval on their proposed takeover is close. A fresh start awaits – hopefully, as the club is in desperate need of one – and the same applies to Sean Dyche’s approach. He has made the team hard to beat but increasingly hard to watch; Everton are without a goal in their last two games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored in his last seven starts yet continues to keep Beto on the bench despite the Guinea-Bissau international offering the team a rare goal threat as a substitute. Calvert-Lewin could, in fairness, point to a desperate lack of quality service. Change is required, either at centre-forward or in the supply line, and while Brentford have lost all five league away games this season it must be noted those defeats have come at Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and to two goals in stoppage time at Fulham.\n\n6\n\nBerge helps fill Fulham’s Palhinha void\nIt would not have been a surprise if Fulham had dropped off after selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich. To their credit, though, they have managed to absorb the loss of the tough-tackling Portugal midfielder. Sasa Lukic, the Serbia international, caught the eye at the start of the season and Sander Berge has done well since breaking into the starting lineup last month. Berge was a canny buy. The Norwegian joined Sheffield United for £22m in 2020 and was relegated 18 months later. He was influential in the Championship, won promotion, joined Burnley and was relegated again last season. Fulham could give the 26-year-old stability. Berge will hope to make his sixth consecutive start when Marco Silva’s high-flying side host Wolves.\n\n7\n\nPep stays on but City must improve\nWhen does a feelgood vibe remain at a club despite a dismal four-game losing streak? Answer: when Manchester City and their all-time great manager, Pep Guardiola, have just agreed a new one-year deal. City look to arrest their slide against Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou’s off-the-cuff attacking unit will suit City. A side mocked as “Doctor Tottenham” – the joke being they provide the cure for a needy side’s ills – have the pace to get in behind the champions’ high line and damage them, too. A fifth consecutive reverse would cast the champions in crisis and have some (misguided) fans questioning the prudency of the Guardiola extension.\n\n8\n\nBottom meets top on south coast\nThere is already a 24-point gap between bottom and top as Southampton prepare to face Liverpool. Trying to find hope for Russell Martin’s side going into this fixture is tricky. At Wolves they failed to have a shot on target despite having 72% possession and they will not dominate the ball in the same manner on Sunday. Southampton’s style is about passing and patient buildup and it is unlikely Martin will ever change, even if the club’s Premier League status and his employment are at risk. All teams need an element of surprise, whether they are first or last, in order to keep opponents guessing, but Southampton’s predictability is their downfall and explains why they are bottom. Reacting when something is not working is a sign of a good coach. If Martin can bring himself to be more direct with the speed of his wingers and strikers, they could spring a much-needed upset.\n\n9\n\nHøjlund to fill Gyökeres role for Amorim?\nAmid all the fanfare surrounding Rúben Amorim, the key question is whether he will implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation and what personnel he could use to do so. At Sporting, Amorim was highly reliant on the quality of Viktor Gyökeres as his lone striker and will almost certainly give that role to Rasmus Højlund on Sunday as the only suitable player in the squad. The Danish international has shown his potential in flashes at United but needs to become more consistent. Højlund needs help in achieving this but he has some similar characteristics to Gyökeres. The Swede was not the finished article when he left Coventry for Sporting but is now one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, partly thanks to Amorim’s support. Quick and strong, Højlund has a similar profile but two goals in 12 appearances this season is not good enough to keep him in the starting lineup in the long term. Amorim might be just the man to help him.\n\n10\n\nLopetegui is on the brink\nMight this be Julen Lopetegui’s last stand? West Ham’s beleaguered manager could probably do without facing an improving Newcastle team fresh from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. England’s Jarrod Bowen will hope to impress in the north-east and ranks high on Eddie Howe’s January shopping list. The number of future visits West Ham might make to St James’ Park is currently a sensitive issue; while most Newcastle fans have indicated a preference for the club remaining at the stadium, the club’s Saudi ownership are currently exploring the idea of building a brand new ground, possibly four miles outside the city centre near the Gosforth Park racecourse. A decision is expected to be announced early in the New Year. Who knows where Lopetegui, or West Ham, will be by then.",

      "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Rúben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
      "article_text": "Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

      "headline": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991)",
      "article_text": "It may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

      "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Rúben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Rúben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime. \n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!”",

      "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane. Susanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Rúben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That’s going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.”",

      "headline": "Ten talking points from the weekend football",
      "article_text": "Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. \n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” \n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” \n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” \n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. \n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. \n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break.  \n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. \n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. \n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer.",

      "article_text": "Rúben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”",

      "headline": "Van Nistelrooy in dark over Manchester United future under Amorim",
      "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th of 36 in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now [to see if Amorim has messaged] – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want [for] my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room, it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put a big performance in.\n\n“The first half [against Paok] wasn’t good. We hardly created anything and Paok neither. We didn’t get going and our possession wasn’t good enough and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good, it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

      "headline": "Amad Diallo ends Manchester United’s European drought by seeing off Paok",
      "article_text": "Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more games without winning in last season’s Champions League.\n\nSo a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever 50th-minute header. The second an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the defender’s manhandling, then fired a shot into the left corner, via a deflection.\n\nAs Ruud van Nistelrooy, United’s interim manager, said: “The second goal had everything in it that for me is Amad Diallo. He fought to take the ball off the Paok defender, pushed through to get the shot, and had the quality to curl it round the goalkeeper.”\n\nBut, prior to that moment, United lacked the ability to kill off Paok well before the close and cruise along in control. Rúben Amorim should know this but United’s incoming manager, if watching, will comprehend the size of the challenge to transform the group he takes over on Monday.\n\nUnited’s results in continental competition this season were 1-1 against Twente, 3-3 at Porto and 1-1 at Fenerbahce. Hardly a roll of honour and when Van Nistelrooy rotated Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt for Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf in central defence, and Diallo for Marcus Rashford in attack, you wondered whether three points would finally be garnered.\n\nThe first half suggested not. Razvan Lucescu configured his Greek champions in a 4-2-3-1 that was a carbon copy of Van Nistelrooy’s shape and Mady Camara, the visiting No 10, exposed a familiar faultline when running into a gap, passing, collecting later in the move, then shooting.\n\nCamara was the Paok equivalent of Bruno Fernandes: a playmaker adept at materialising in pockets and running his team. United’s captain did this when popping up at the left angle of Paok’s area and threading the ball to Diallo, whose cross was cleared. Then came a buccaneering sequence reminiscent of a Sir Alex Ferguson vintage.\n\nDiallo jinked about infield, fed Noussair Mazraoui, who switched the ball back into space on the right. This invited Casemiro to run on and hit an instant delivery to the far post where Alejandro Garnacho headed against Jonny’s arm, but a corner rather than penalty was Radu Petrescu’s decision. The referee – and VAR – made the same call later when Diallo went down under Baba’s challenge.\n\nDiallo was United’s bright light. His next act was to drop the ball on to Rasmus Højlund’s head but, twisting, the centre-forward’s header was insipid. A 65% possession rate showed the home team’s dominance. As usual, the problem was execution in the final third. Earlier, Garnacho fluffed a regulation pass to an overlapping colleague in Paok’s area. Now he offered a repeat, again following a burst through an inside-left channel: this time, Diogo Dalot missed.\n\nPaok lurked, waiting to pounce on any United slipshodness. Such as when the lightweight Manuel Ugarte was bullied around the halfway line, leading to Andrija Zivkovic hammering a dipping 20-yard effort into André Onana’s clutches.\n\nHere was a hint that United might suffer if their profligacy was not cured. Diallo was inches from doing so when hurling himself at a Garnacho cross. But he, not the ball, ended in the goal, Baba scrambling it away.\n\nAs they headed for the break – nearly behind due to a Camara rocket that burned Onana’s fingertips when deflecting over – toothless was the report on United’s opening 45 minutes. Impotency, too, is the tale of their campaign thus far. Van Nistelrooy, a ruthless assassin when United’s striker, needed to address this when his troops trailed off for the interval refreshments.\n\nYet more of the same followed. Garnacho did manage to locate Dalot on the overlap this time but the latter failed to find Fernandes as he arrived in Paok’s area. Fernandes showed the defender how it is done, as United discovered ruthlessness at last. Along the left, Garnacho glanced up and tapped to his captain who chipped in a precise ball that had the excellent Diallo leaping and looping a header back across goal which wrongfooted Dominik Kotarski, the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nFernandes was United’s hub. Next, he created for Diallo once more with a curving through ball: the forward ran in but saw his attempt saved. United were serving up another smorgasbord of chances, but too many were spurned. Dalot blazed over, Fernandes did the same, and in between Garnacho went to ground in the penalty area under the attentions of Tomasz Kedziora and Jonny, and once more Petrescu’s judgment of no spot-kick was dubious.\n\nTarik Tissoudali gave United a fright near goal but his nerve failed and he unloaded a shot straight into Onana’s gloves. Soon after Diallo’s second he hurt his leg and was replaced despite appearing to be fine. United will hope so ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.",

      "headline": "Onana claims Manchester United will ‘step up’ for arrival of Rúben Amorim",
      "article_text": "André Onana has backed his Manchester United teammates to “step up” and adapt to Rúben Amorim’s style after watching Sporting defeat Manchester City 4-1 in the Champions League. Amorim, who will arrive in England next week to replace Erik ten Hag, prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.\n\n“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s Europa League game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them [Sporting], by the way. Different system, but the players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”\n\nUnited have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester and a league draw against Chelsea but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim about the team or his future.\n\nOnana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”\n\nOne player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”\n\nUnited have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.",

        "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nHow did last week's team do?\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m\n\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, £6m\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\nLewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\nDwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\nJoao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\nBernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\nLucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\nIbrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\nBrighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

        "headline": "06:55 21 November'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
        "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\nNeil Johnston\nBBC Sport journalist in Lisbon\nPublished 2 November 2024\nUpdated 21 November 2024\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\"\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.",

        "article_text": "Lille’s Angel Gomes has forged an unconventional path to the England team.\n\nHailed as a wonderkid by supporters of his boyhood club Manchester United, Gomes seemed destined for greatness at Old Trafford.\n\nHe made his debut under Jose Mourinho aged 16 but just three years' later was walking away from the club with tears in his eyes.\n\nFrustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities, Gomes rejected a new deal, making the \"difficult\" choice to leave to \"better myself as a player and person\".\n\nHe joined Lille in 2020 - and was immediately sent on a season-long loan to Portuguese team Boavista - before returning to the French side.\n\nThe move has allowed him to quietly improve his game while remaining on England's radar.\n\nGomes, who was part of the Under-17s World Cup winning squad from 2017, was also involved in the triumphant 2023 Under-21s European Championship side under Lee Carsley.\n\nSix of that team, including Gomes, were then selected by Carsley after he became interim manager of the senior squad, for September’s Uefa Nations League wins over the Republic of Ireland and Finland.\n\nNow, aged 24, Gomes has four senior caps and hopes to build on his progress under new manager Thomas Tuchel but should senior recognition have come sooner?\n\n\"When he was called up by England, we were like ‘have they never watched him play? Why has it taken them so long?\" French football writer Julien Laurens told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We’ve seen for the past three years how good he is. It felt right that he finally got his chance.\"\n\nWhile Gomes' England selection caught many by surprise, it perhaps shouldn't have done.\n\nGomes is now into his fourth season in Lille’s first-team squad. In that time, he has also played in the Champions League and Conference League.\n\n\"He’s one of the best players in Ligue 1, there’s no doubt,\" added Laurens.\n\n\"The fans love him; a player that you enjoy watching because he’s just so elegant, so creative, such a great touch.\n\n\"If you know your football, you know that teams need players like Angel Gomes that make everything click and make everything happen.\"\n\nThe Salford-raised midfielder was highly rated at youth level, with England and Manchester United.\n\n\"Angel was always spoken about highly because he’s quality as a player,\" Jonathan Panzo, who is on loan at Portuguese Primeira Liga side Rio Ave from Nottingham Forest, told BBC Sport when recalling the first time he trained with Gomes.\n\n\"You hear about someone, then you get to see it and you are like 'they weren’t lying about this player’.  \n\n\"He is definitely one of the best players I have played with.\"\n\nGomes’ crowning moment in youth football came in 2017 when England won the Under-17s World Cup in India.\n\nManaged by Leicester City boss Steve Cooper, the team included Manchester City's Phil Foden, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, Chelsea’s Jadon Sancho and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.\n\n\"It was so special,\" Joel Latibeaudiere, England’s captain in India who now plays for Coventry City, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"On the pitch, he creates goals \\[and\\] chances. Also, I think he has a massive effect off the pitch in terms of keeping the camp bubbly.\n\n\"Seven weeks with the same group of people can be tough and keeping that camaraderie going can be tough.\"\n\n\"He is down to earth,\" added Panzo, also a World Cup winner in India. \"He gets his head down, works hard, is humble. That’s what I love about him, he never changes.\"\n\nBefore success in India, Gomes had already made his Premier League debut, becoming United’s youngest player since Duncan Edwards in 1953.\n\nHe went on to make 10 first-team appearances for United before being released at the end of the 2019-20 season after failing to agree terms on a new contract.\n\nAfter Gomes' release, he signed a five-year contract with Lille and immediately went on a season-long loan to Boavista in Portugal. He played 30 of Boavista's 34 league games, starting 29 times.\n\n\"What French clubs are very good at, especially clubs like Lille who are maybe not the top, \\[is\\] keeping tabs on really good young talents around Europe,\" Laurens explained.\n\n\"If you faced an Angel Gomes in youth football and you are impressed, he stays in your scouting data. If it doesn’t work out at Manchester United or somewhere else, then you know exactly what his qualities are and the talent he has.\n\n\"I remember when they signed him, they really could not believe that they were able to.\"\n\nSince Gomes' return to Lille, he has been a mainstay, making 126 appearances.\n\nDuring his United days, Gomes was mainly an attacking midfielder. Now, he has the ability to play in a range of central midfield roles.\n\n\"His technical ability really is great,\" Laurens explained. \"He’s got amazing vision, he sees the game before everybody else.\n\n\"It’s a profile that England don't produce much and \\[the\\] 10 \\[position\\] is maybe where you get the most out of him because he’s so creative playing behind the striker, he will shine.\"\n\n\"He's like a magician,\" said Panzo. \"He's a small player, but his IQ is so smart and he just knows how to get around the pitch.\"\n\n\"The thing that makes \\[Gomes\\] stand out the most is his build and how he can dominate a role in which a lot of people think you need a big stature,\" Latibeaudiere added.\n\n\"What he's really improved on is almost controlling the game. He's \\[now playing\\] in a deeper role so his understanding of the game has seemed to improve a lot because \\[in\\] that role, you are the one that dictates play \\[and\\] the tempo.\"\n\nGomes' rise comes in a new era for England's national team.\n\nLast week's Nations League fixtures against Greece and the Republic of Ireland were the last under Carsley before Tuchel takes charge.\n\nIt is also a big season for Gomes off the pitch.\n\nHis contract is set to expire next summer and Lille may struggle to retain Gomes now his quality has become widely-appreciated. He's been linked with a switch to Tottenham Hotspur in January and even with a return to Manchester United.\n\n\"Ideally Lille would want him to extend and let him go in the summer for a bit of money,\" Laurens said. \"I doubt that he will sign an extension.\"\n\nBut what is Gomes’ ceiling?\n\n\"He can go as high as he wants,\" Latibeaudiere said.\n\n\"He made a great decision to go to Portugal when he did and get minutes under his belt. Making the move to France \\[was\\] another great decision.\n\n\"I'm so happy to see him step up onto the international stage as well.\"",

        "article_text": "Leny Yoro is fully fit and gearing up for his Man United debut under new head coach Ruben Amorim this month.\n\nLeny Yoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night.\n\nYoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left.\n\nYoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91 million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City.\n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now.\n\nShaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

        "headline": "Manchester United team news as Ruben Amorim gets set for his first game in charge, against Ipswich Town on Sunday",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era. Amorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\n\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford. After fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans. If he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country. The 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho. \n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n**Rashford up top**\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign. Rasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible. In his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.",

        "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United since February 18. Both are now back in full training. Full backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo, and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

        "article_text": "Sekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim has three key Man United selection decisions to make as first task clear",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is beginning to settle into his new surroundings and there are already a number of key decisions to make ahead of his Premier League bow against Ipswich Town. \n\nTaking over during an international break can have its positives, such as an extended period to implement new ideas, and negatives, including a depleted squad due to international involvement. For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad fresh off a busy summer of spending but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s. \n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nEqually, with Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure, and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer-term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.",

        "article_text": "Lyon winger Rayan Cherki's stats have been compared to Premier League talents Cole Palmer and Phil Foden amid his transfer links to Liverpool.\n\nLast week it was reported that Liverpool were considering making a move for French winger Cherki as a potential replacement to superstar Mohamed Salah if they are unable to agree on a new deal for the Egyptian.\n\nThe 21-year-old has impressed in recent years, drawing attention from some of the biggest clubs across Europe, including Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBut how would Cherki compare with the likes of some of the best young talents in the Premier League if he were to secure a move to Liverpool in the summer?  \n\nCesc Fabregas gives his verdict on Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden.\n\nThroughout his career, the 21-year-old attacker has been compared to Eden Hazard due to his style of play, abilities with both feet and his physical build, but when considering his stats against players like Palmer and Foden, we learn a lot about Cherki.\n\nSo far this season, stars provided by Opta, via Squawka, show that Cherki has made seven domestic appearances for the Ligue One side, scoring one goal and assisting another, while averaging 0.8 shots on target per 90 minutes played.\n\nMeanwhile Foden is yet to score a Premier League goal this season despite featuring in eight matches for reigning champions Manchester City.\n\nThe Englishman, who has over 100 minutes more than Cherki this season, has one assist in the League so far and averages just 0.2 shots on target per 90.\n\nFar in front of both Cherki and Foden in terms of stats this season is Chelsea superstar Palmer, who has scored an impressive seven goals and assisted five in 11 Premier League appearances.\n\nAnd, while the 22-year-old has enjoyed considerably more minutes than either Cherki or Foden, he boasts the most shots on target per 90 minutes with an average of 1.3.\n\nHowever, Cherki ranks very well when compared with other wingers and attacking midfielders across Europe's top five leagues for expected assists and shot-creating actions.\n\nHe also sits in the 97th percentile for progressive passes and compares well against players like Leroy Sane and Florian Wirtz.\n\nHowever, Cherki is very low in terms of defensive metrics, but this could be due to Lyon's style of play.",

        "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is a big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals. I think he’s not a typical goal scoring striker, he’s also the player who can help the teammates to create space for them.”",

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely.

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up. If you let up, it's over, then you'll go under.",

        "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“ This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\"\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n\"If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe,\" Porro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option.

Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past; the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

        "article_text": "Roy Keane has explained the reasons why he chose ‘16’ as his shirt number while playing for Manchester United.\n\nKeane, 53, is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and finished his career with seven Premier League crowns, four FA Cup wins, and a Champions League, as well as winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup during his season-long spell at Celtic.\n\nFollowing his 2006 retirement, Keane managed Sunderland to the 2006/07 Championship title - gaining promotion to the top flight.\n\nThe Cork-born former centre-midfielder was known for his blend of combative but classy play.\n\nTraditionally, centre-midfielders wear ‘6,’ ‘8,’ or ‘10.’ However, unusually, he wore the number ‘16’ for most of his time at Old Trafford, and the 53-year-old explained the reasons behind his choice of number.\n\nThe former Ireland international had worn the number ‘6,’ ‘8,’ ‘9,’ and ‘11’ during his time at Nottingham Forest between 1990 and 1993.\n\n“Well, I didn’t choose it, no,” Keane explained when speaking to Ian Wright and Gary Neville during an episode of The Overlap. “When I went to Manchester United, my squad number was 16…just my training number,” he explained. “Then when the number come in, and I just said, ‘I’ll stay with my squad number.”\n\n“And the manager, when Eric Cantona left, he said, ‘I want you to have the number seven,” Keane added. “I said, ‘No, No…give it to Becks (David Beckham).”\n\n“And Ferguson went, ‘I don’t f****g want him to have it.”\n\nThe group of ex-footballers were expecting a more complex answer, but the 2006 World Cup-winning midfielder’s simplicity had them laughing. De Rossi, who is a long-time admirer of Keane, credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

        "article_text": "Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.\n\nAn official statement from the BBC confirmed that Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\nJenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'.\n\nAnd now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family.\n\n“My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy.\n\n“Now I just want to move forward.\n\n“Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.”\n\nDespite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future.\n\n\"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added.\n\n\"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future.\n\n“He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.”\n\nWhen details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie.\n\nHe said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault.\n\n“The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family.\n\n“There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.”\n\n“Ellie is absolutely raging.

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus. We’ve always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it. And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has opened up on the regret that his wife \"throws in my face every day\".\n\nThe 39-year-old, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday as the Reds come up against Ipswich Town, has enjoyed a remarkable rise since taking over at third-tier Portuguese sider Casa Pia in 2018.\n\nHe went on to impress at Braga, the club he spent a year at during his playing career, before Sporting triggered the €10 million (£8.3m) clause in his contract. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age of 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n\"I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.\"\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S. Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT. \"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away. They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.",

        "headline": "Man Utd have player who is 'impossible to ignore' as Ruben Amorim told to take immediate action",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been told about a player in the Manchester United ranks who is \"impossible to ignore\" as he prepares to take charge of his first game. After succeeding Erik ten Hag as the next United head coach, Amorim has some big decisions to make in the coming months when it comes to team selection. Amad Diallo is set for a 'prominent' role under the new manager, according to journalist Dean Jones, who says Amorim is 'excited' by the winger's technical ability, work off the ball, and creativity in the final third. We will get more of an insight into his thinking on Sunday afternoon, when United travel to Portman Road to take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town. But ahead of the Premier League clash, Amorim has been urged to take a look at one of their academy prospects. Earlier this week, United under-21s maintained their unbeaten record in the National League Cup with a 4-0 win over Altrincham as highly-rated striker Ethan Ennis scored a hat-trick. Ennis, who joined the Reds from Liverpool in 2021, becoming the first player in 57 years to do so, has netted nine goals and two assists in 12 academy appearances this season. And the 19-year-old forward has been tipped to push for a spot in the first-team by Steven Railston of the Manchester Evening News. \"So what you might be wondering, could Ennis be pushing to make his first-team debut? The answer is he should be,\" he said. \"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first-team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\" Ennis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. Back in August, the MEN reported: \"He will continue to be an integral U21 player and could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.\"",

Dide has been able to keep things under wraps but has pulled back the curtain ever so slightly, opening up about how he balances being a football and musician at the same time.\n\nIn April he said Kevin De Bruyne is the best player he has played against before claiming his teammates and manager had no idea about his hustle on the side.\n\nEddie Nketiah, Wilfried Zaha, Reiss Nelson and Alex Iwobi were just some of the many suggestions fans have come up with but some also 'outed' Sheyi Ojo, who Liverpool bought for a fee of £2 million when he was just 14.\n\nOjo, a member of England's Under 20 World Cup-winning squad in 2017, played 13 times for the Reds and left for Cardiff City in 2022 after a number of loan spells, including Wolves, Fulham, Rangers and Reims.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Slovenian side NK Maribor in September but in a new interview with The Athletic, Ojo was asked if he is actually Dide.\n\nAnd he was happy to dismiss talk of it being him as he would not be one to put 'anything else in the picture to sway my concentration'.\n\n\"It’s funny because everywhere I go people ask me about it but honestly I haven’t got a clue who it is,\" Ojo said.\n\n\"All I can say is I’m super focused on football as I always have been, that’s pretty much the only thing that matters to me. I wouldn’t be putting anything else in the picture to sway my concentration, it’s definitely not something I’m involved in but I understand everyone’s curiosities.\"\n\nA year ago Aston Villa and Belgium midfielder Amadou Onana, then at Everton, claimed he knew Dide's real identify but could not possibly disclose it due to a 'code'.\n\n\"There has been some rumours but there is a player code that I can't break,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"People try to get it out of my mouth but I won't.\"",

She is rumoured to be earning a joint-record £1.5 million for heading into the jungle and has already been discussing her relationship with one of the Premier League's best ever players.\n\nAnd the row with Vardy has been reignited, with plenty of jibes being made by hosts Ant and Dec and Coleen briefly talking about the 'Wagatha Christie' 2022 trial.\n\nRebekah, a former I'm a Celeb contestant back in 2017, couldn't help but respond on Instagram, writing: \"That feeling when you are living rent free in people's heads [laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe 42-year-old is serving as a columnist for The Sun on jungle affairs and in a video doing the rounds, described Coleen as \"the gift that keeps on giving\" after her boat sank twice in episode one.\n\nFans have wondered what Leicester City striker Vardy thinks about his other half's antics but according to Rebekah, he doesn't mind it at all and is supportive of her actions.\n\nThe mum of five also claimed any abuse subjected to him on the pitch spurs him on.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Jamie is mad at me for speaking out, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,\" she said, as per The Mirror.\n\n\"He’s encouraging me, saying, ‘Give it to her, get the truth out there’.

The more stick he gets from the stands in football, the better he plays.\"\n\nIn a recent column for The Sun, Rebekah accused Coleen of copying her in going into I'm a Celeb and claiming \"she always wanted my life\".\n\nVardy lost the well-publicised defamation trial and after she was ordered to cover a hefty portion Coleen's legal expenses along with her costs, which were estimated to total £3 million.",

        "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017. He showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. The player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

        "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
        "article_text": "Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?\n\n1\n\nDewsbury-Hall back on familiar ground\nAfter masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.\n\n2\n\nO’Riley can be pivotal to Brighton\nMatt O’Riley endured a tough start to his Brighton career when he suffered an ankle injury caused by a poor challenge nine minutes into his debut in the Carabao Cup against Crawley. The midfielder missed the following three months but showed his worth on his return to help transform the game against Manchester City and score the winner. Fabian Hürzeler and Brighton earmarked O’Riley as the man required in midfield to sit alongside Carlos Baleba, who has been struggling with a knee problem, and they could be paired from the start at Bournemouth. Brighton have not missed O’Riley much, starting the weekend in sixth. Baleba is 20 and O’Riley 24, meaning they could be a long-term partnership. That is not often the way at Brighton but if they perform as hoped the pair could provide the foundation for another push for European football while increasing their value.\n\n3\n\nCan Forest repeat Anfield heist?\nArsenal have picked up two points from 12 available over the past four games and are in a tricky spot. The prospect of facing the side immediately below them, who are yet to lose away all season, is a daunting one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have defeated Liverpool this season, proving they have the cunning and quality to topple title contenders. At Anfield, Forest’s success came about by packing the midfield and stopping Liverpool from playing with fluidity. It would seem Nuno might do similar to prevent Martin Ødegaard from pulling the strings. Forest’s manager has proven his intelligence when it comes to stifling opponents, while possessing a potent attacking threat. After losing to Newcastle, Nuno will want a reaction from his players. If he can get it to resemble the performance at Anfield he could be managing a top-four team by Saturday evening.\n\n4\n\nWill Villa’s miserable month continue?\nA winless month – including four consecutive defeats – has taken the wind out of Aston Villa’s sails. Such patterns are not unknown for Unai Emery; his teams can blow hot and cold. That grim run has betrayed the fatigue of coming so far so fast and suggested that opposition managers may be cracking the Villa code. Emery’s high-risk football, when it falters, can often look one-dimensional as Villa did in successive chastening defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. With Ollie Watkins making an international breakthrough, and Morgan Rogers getting his first cap, Emery will hope for a lift in morale. Oliver Glasner, with fewer resources at Crystal Palace than Emery, has hit on similar problems, having initially been so successful last season. It still comes as a surprise to see Palace in the bottom three. Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton recovering fitness and form could be key for the Austrian manager.\n\n5\n\nEverton need to freshen up their game\nThis could be the final home game of the dreadful Farhad Moshiri era for Everton, with the Friedkin Group hoping that Premier League approval on their proposed takeover is close. A fresh start awaits – hopefully, as the club is in desperate need of one – and the same applies to Sean Dyche’s approach. He has made the team hard to beat but increasingly hard to watch; Everton are without a goal in their last two games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored in his last seven starts yet continues to keep Beto on the bench despite the Guinea-Bissau international offering the team a rare goal threat as a substitute. Calvert-Lewin could, in fairness, point to a desperate lack of quality service. Change is required, either at centre-forward or in the supply line, and while Brentford have lost all five league away games this season it must be noted those defeats have come at Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and to two goals in stoppage time at Fulham.\n\n6\n\nBerge helps fill Fulham’s Palhinha void\nIt would not have been a surprise if Fulham had dropped off after selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich. To their credit, though, they have managed to absorb the loss of the tough-tackling Portugal midfielder. Sasa Lukic, the Serbia international, caught the eye at the start of the season and Sander Berge has done well since breaking into the starting lineup last month. Berge was a canny buy. The Norwegian joined Sheffield United for £22m in 2020 and was relegated 18 months later. He was influential in the Championship, won promotion, joined Burnley and was relegated again last season. Fulham could give the 26-year-old stability. Berge will hope to make his sixth consecutive start when Marco Silva’s high-flying side host Wolves.\n\n7\n\nPep stays on but City must improve\nWhen does a feelgood vibe remain at a club despite a dismal four-game losing streak? Answer: when Manchester City and their all-time great manager, Pep Guardiola, have just agreed a new one-year deal. City look to arrest their slide against Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou’s off-the-cuff attacking unit will suit City. A side mocked as “Doctor Tottenham” – the joke being they provide the cure for a needy side’s ills – have the pace to get in behind the champions’ high line and damage them, too. A fifth consecutive reverse would cast the champions in crisis and have some (misguided) fans questioning the prudency of the Guardiola extension.\n\n8\n\nBottom meets top on south coast\nThere is already a 24-point gap between bottom and top as Southampton prepare to face Liverpool. Trying to find hope for Russell Martin’s side going into this fixture is tricky. At Wolves they failed to have a shot on target despite having 72% possession and they will not dominate the ball in the same manner on Sunday. Southampton’s style is about passing and patient buildup and it is unlikely Martin will ever change, even if the club’s Premier League status and his employment are at risk. All teams need an element of surprise, whether they are first or last, in order to keep opponents guessing, but Southampton’s predictability is their downfall and explains why they are bottom. Reacting when something is not working is a sign of a good coach. If Martin can bring himself to be more direct with the speed of his wingers and strikers, they could spring a much-needed upset.\n\n9\n\nHøjlund to fill Gyökeres role for Amorim?\nAmid all the fanfare surrounding Rúben Amorim, the key question is whether he will implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation and what personnel he could use to do so. At Sporting, Amorim was highly reliant on the quality of Viktor Gyökeres as his lone striker and will almost certainly give that role to Rasmus Højlund on Sunday as the only suitable player in the squad. The Danish international has shown his potential in flashes at United but needs to become more consistent. Højlund needs help in achieving this but he has some similar characteristics to Gyökeres. The Swede was not the finished article when he left Coventry for Sporting but is now one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, partly thanks to Amorim’s support. Quick and strong, Højlund has a similar profile but two goals in 12 appearances this season is not good enough to keep him in the starting lineup in the long term. Amorim might be just the man to help him.\n\n10\n\nLopetegui is on the brink\nMight this be Julen Lopetegui’s last stand? West Ham’s beleaguered manager could probably do without facing an improving Newcastle team fresh from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. England’s Jarrod Bowen will hope to impress in the north-east and ranks high on Eddie Howe’s January shopping list. The number of future visits West Ham might make to St James’ Park is currently a sensitive issue; while most Newcastle fans have indicated a preference for the club remaining at the stadium, the club’s Saudi ownership are currently exploring the idea of building a brand new ground, possibly four miles outside the city centre near the Gosforth Park racecourse. A decision is expected to be announced early in the New Year. Who knows where Lopetegui, or West Ham, will be by then.",

        "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Rúben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
        "article_text": "Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

        "headline": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991",
        "article_text": "It may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

        "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Rúben Amorim",
        "article_text": "Rúben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!”",

        "headline": "Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes helps unwell passenger during flight",
        "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane. Susanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help.

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Rúben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four. That’s going to be the biggest challenge for the trainers, to get everyone on the same wavelength and same page to improve as a team and improve as players.",

        "headline": "Ten talking points from the weekend football",
        "article_text": "Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer.\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.”\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.”\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.”\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it.\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out.\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break.\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks.\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating.\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer.",

        "article_text": "Rúben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”",

Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now [to see if Amorim has messaged] – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that.

That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room, it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put a big performance in.\n\n“The first half [against Paok] wasn’t good. We hardly created anything and Paok neither. We didn’t get going and our possession wasn’t good enough and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good, it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

        "headline": "Amad Diallo ends Manchester United’s European drought by seeing off Paok",
        "article_text": "Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more games without winning in last season’s Champions League.\n\nSo a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever 50th-minute header. The second an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the defender’s manhandling, then fired a shot into the left corner, via a deflection.\n\nAs Ruud van Nistelrooy, United’s interim manager, said: “The second goal had everything in it that for me is Amad Diallo. He fought to take the ball off the Paok defender, pushed through to get the shot, and had the quality to curl it round the goalkeeper.”\n\nBut, prior to that moment, United lacked the ability to kill off Paok well before the close and cruise along in control. Rúben Amorim should know this but United’s incoming manager, if watching, will comprehend the size of the challenge to transform the group he takes over on Monday.\n\nUnited’s results in continental competition this season were 1-1 against Twente, 3-3 at Porto and 1-1 at Fenerbahce. Hardly a roll of honour and when Van Nistelrooy rotated Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt for Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf in central defence, and Diallo for Marcus Rashford in attack, you wondered whether three points would finally be garnered.\n\nThe first half suggested not. Razvan Lucescu configured his Greek champions in a 4-2-3-1 that was a carbon copy of Van Nistelrooy’s shape and Mady Camara, the visiting No 10, exposed a familiar faultline when running into a gap, passing, collecting later in the move, then shooting.\n\nCamara was the Paok equivalent of Bruno Fernandes: a playmaker adept at materialising in pockets and running his team. United’s captain did this when popping up at the left angle of Paok’s area and threading the ball to Diallo, whose cross was cleared. Then came a buccaneering sequence reminiscent of a Sir Alex Ferguson vintage.\n\nDiallo jinked about infield, fed Noussair Mazraoui, who switched the ball back into space on the right. This invited Casemiro to run on and hit an instant delivery to the far post where Alejandro Garnacho headed against Jonny’s arm, but a corner rather than penalty was Radu Petrescu’s decision. The referee – and VAR – made the same call later when Diallo went down under Baba’s challenge.\n\nDiallo was United’s bright light. His next act was to drop the ball on to Rasmus Højlund’s head but, twisting, the centre-forward’s header was insipid. A 65% possession rate showed the home team’s dominance. As usual, the problem was execution in the final third. Earlier, Garnacho fluffed a regulation pass to an overlapping colleague in Paok’s area. Now he offered a repeat, again following a burst through an inside-left channel: this time, Diogo Dalot missed.\n\nPaok lurked, waiting to pounce on any United slipshodness. Such as when the lightweight Manuel Ugarte was bullied around the halfway line, leading to Andrija Zivkovic hammering a dipping 20-yard effort into André Onana’s clutches.\n\nHere was a hint that United might suffer if their profligacy was not cured. Diallo was inches from doing so when hurling himself at a Garnacho cross. But he, not the ball, ended in the goal, Baba scrambling it away.\n\nAs they headed for the break – nearly behind due to a Camara rocket that burned Onana’s fingertips when deflecting over – toothless was the report on United’s opening 45 minutes. Impotency, too, is the tale of their campaign thus far. Van Nistelrooy, a ruthless assassin when United’s striker, needed to address this when his troops trailed off for the interval refreshments.\n\nYet more of the same followed. Garnacho did manage to locate Dalot on the overlap this time but the latter failed to find Fernandes as he arrived in Paok’s area. Fernandes showed the defender how it is done, as United discovered ruthlessness at last. Along the left, Garnacho glanced up and tapped to his captain who chipped in a precise ball that had the excellent Diallo leaping and looping a header back across goal which wrongfooted Dominik Kotarski, the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nFernandes was United’s hub. Next, he created for Diallo once more with a curving through ball: the forward ran in but saw his attempt saved. United were serving up another smorgasbord of chances, but too many were spurned. Dalot blazed over, Fernandes did the same, and in between Garnacho went to ground in the penalty area under the attentions of Tomasz Kedziora and Jonny, and once more Petrescu’s judgment of no spot-kick was dubious.\n\nTarik Tissoudali gave United a fright near goal but his nerve failed and he unloaded a shot straight into Onana’s gloves. Soon after Diallo’s second he hurt his leg and was replaced despite appearing to be fine. United will hope so ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.",

        "headline": "Onana claims Manchester United will ‘step up’ for arrival of Rúben Amorim",
        "article_text": "André Onana has backed his Manchester United teammates to “step up” and adapt to Rúben Amorim’s style after watching Sporting defeat Manchester City 4-1 in the Champions League. Amorim, who will arrive in England next week to replace Erik ten Hag, prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.\n\n“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s Europa League game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them [Sporting], by the way. Different system, but the players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”\n\nUnited have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester and a league draw against Chelsea but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim about the team or his future.\n\nOnana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”\n\nOne player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”\n\nUnited have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.",

        "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nHow did last week's team do?\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to 92 points and a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m\n\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, £6m\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\nLewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\nDwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nOnly Haaland, with 19, has had more big chances.\n\nJoao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\nBernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\nLucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\nIbrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\nBrighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

        "headline": "06:55 21 November'The second Special One' - Amorim, by those who know him best",
        "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\nNeil Johnston\nBBC Sport journalist in Lisbon\nPublished 2 November 2024\nUpdated 21 November 2024\n\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\"\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\nAmorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.",

        "article_text": "Lille’s Angel Gomes has forged an unconventional path to the England team.\n\nHailed as a wonderkid by supporters of his boyhood club Manchester United, Gomes seemed destined for greatness at Old Trafford.\n\nHe made his debut under Jose Mourinho aged 16 but just three years' later was walking away from the club with tears in his eyes.\n\nFrustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities, Gomes rejected a new deal, making the \"difficult\" choice to leave to \"better myself as a player and person\".\n\nHe joined Lille in 2020 - and was immediately sent on a season-long loan to Portuguese team Boavista - before returning to the French side.\n\nThe move has allowed him to quietly improve his game while remaining on England's radar.\n\nGomes, who was part of the Under-17s World Cup winning squad from 2017, was also involved in the triumphant 2023 Under-21s European Championship side under Lee Carsley.\n\nSix of that team, including Gomes, were then selected by Carsley after he became interim manager of the senior squad, for September’s Uefa Nations League wins over the Republic of Ireland and Finland.\n\nNow, aged 24, Gomes has four senior caps and hopes to build on his progress under new manager Thomas Tuchel but should senior recognition have come sooner?\n\n\"When he was called up by England, we were like ‘have they never watched him play? Why has it taken them so long?\" French football writer Julien Laurens told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We’ve seen for the past three years how good he is. It felt right that he finally got his chance.\"\n\nWhile Gomes' England selection caught many by surprise, it perhaps shouldn't have done.\n\nGomes is now into his fourth season in Lille’s first-team squad. In that time, he has also played in the Champions League and Conference League.\n\n\"He’s one of the best players in Ligue 1, there’s no doubt,\" added Laurens.\n\n\"The fans love him; a player that you enjoy watching because he’s just so elegant, so creative, such a great touch.\n\n\"If you know your football, you know that teams need players like Angel Gomes that make everything click and make everything happen.\"\n\nThe Salford-raised midfielder was highly rated at youth level, with England and Manchester United.\n\n\"Angel was always spoken about highly because he’s quality as a player,\" Jonathan Panzo, who is on loan at Portuguese Primeira Liga side Rio Ave from Nottingham Forest, told BBC Sport when recalling the first time he trained with Gomes.\n\n\"You hear about someone, then you get to see it and you are like 'they weren’t lying about this player’.  \n\n\"He is definitely one of the best players I have played with.\"\n\nGomes’ crowning moment in youth football came in 2017 when England won the Under-17s World Cup in India.\n\nManaged by Leicester City boss Steve Cooper, the team included Manchester City's Phil Foden, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, Chelsea’s Jadon Sancho and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.\n\n\"It was so special,\" Joel Latibeaudiere, England’s captain in India who now plays for Coventry City, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"On the pitch, he creates goals \\[and\\] chances. Also, I think he has a massive effect off the pitch in terms of keeping the camp bubbly.\n\n\"Seven weeks with the same group of people can be tough and keeping that camaraderie going can be tough.\"\n\n\"He is down to earth,\" added Panzo, also a World Cup winner in India. \"He gets his head down, works hard, is humble. That’s what I love about him, he never changes.\"\n\nBefore success in India, Gomes had already made his Premier League debut, becoming United’s youngest player since Duncan Edwards in 1953.\n\nHe went on to make 10 first-team appearances for United before being released at the end of the 2019-20 season after failing to agree terms on a new contract.\n\nAfter Gomes' release, he signed a five-year contract with Lille and immediately went on a season-long loan to Boavista in Portugal. He played 30 of Boavista's 34 league games, starting 29 times.\n\n\"What French clubs are very good at, especially clubs like Lille who are maybe not the top, \\[is\\] keeping tabs on really good young talents around Europe,\" Laurens explained.\n\n\"If you faced an Angel Gomes in youth football and you are impressed, he stays in your scouting data. If it doesn’t work out at Manchester United or somewhere else, then you know exactly what his qualities are and the talent he has.\n\n\"I remember when they signed him, they really could not believe that they were able to.\"\n\nSince Gomes' return to Lille, he has been a mainstay, making 126 appearances.\n\nDuring his United days, Gomes was mainly an attacking midfielder. Now, he has the ability to play in a range of central midfield roles.\n\n\"His technical ability really is great,\" Laurens explained. \"He’s got amazing vision, he sees the game before everybody else.\n\n\"It’s a profile that England don't produce much and \\[the\\] 10 \\[position\\] is maybe where you get the most out of him because he’s so creative playing behind the striker, he will shine.\"\n\n\"He's like a magician,\" said Panzo. \"He's a small player, but his IQ is so smart and he just knows how to get around the pitch.\"\n\n\"The thing that makes \\[Gomes\\] stand out the most is his build and how he can dominate a role in which a lot of people think you need a big stature,\" Latibeaudiere added.\n\n\"What he's really improved on is almost controlling the game. He's \\[now playing\\] in a deeper role so his understanding of the game has seemed to improve a lot because \\[in\\] that role, you are the one that dictates play \\[and\\] the tempo.\"\n\nGomes' rise comes in a new era for England's national team.\n\nLast week's Nations League fixtures against Greece and the Republic of Ireland were the last under Carsley before Tuchel takes charge.\n\nIt is also a big season for Gomes off the pitch.\n\nHis contract is set to expire next summer and Lille may struggle to retain Gomes now his quality has become widely-appreciated. He's been linked with a switch to Tottenham Hotspur in January and even with a return to Manchester United.\n\n\"Ideally Lille would want him to extend and let him go in the summer for a bit of money,\" Laurens said. \"I doubt that he will sign an extension.\"\n\nBut what is Gomes’ ceiling?\n\n\"He can go as high as he wants,\" Latibeaudiere said.\n\n\"He made a great decision to go to Portugal when he did and get minutes under his belt. Making the move to France \\[was\\] another great decision.\n\n\"I'm so happy to see him step up onto the international stage as well.\"",

        "article_text": "Leny Yoro is fully fit and gearing up for his Man United debut under new head coach Ruben Amorim this month.\n\nLeny Yoro was withdrawn from the Manchester United Under 21 squad against Altrincham on Tuesday night.\n\nYoro, who is now involved in team training after recovering from a metatarsal fracture, was informed on Monday he was due to start at Altrincham in the 4-0 National League Cup victory. He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left.\n\nYoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91 million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City.\n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now.\n\nShaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

        "headline": "Manchester United team news as Ruben Amorim gets set for his first game in charge, against Ipswich Town on Sunday",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's much anticipated first game in charge of Manchester United is a little under 72 hours away as excitement continues to build for the new era. Amorim has built an impressive coaching reputation in Portugal and there is a buzz around United as the 39-year-old prepares to lead the team out for the first time this weekend. United visit Ipswich Town in the Premier League before an Old Trafford Europa League contest against Bodo/Glimt next week.\n\nUnited are expected to deploy a 3-4-3 system under Amorim, who has enjoyed huge success with that shape in his homeland. It will see several changes in set-up and we take a look at five surprise selections Amorim could spring.\n\n**Yoro debut**\n\nThe prospect of seeing Leny Yoro make his competitive bow for United in Amorim's first game at the helm is exciting. The Frenchman, 19, was United's most eye-catching signing of the summer and club officials have high hopes he can become a star at Old Trafford. After fracturing his metatarsal in July, Yoro has had a long road back to full fitness, but he is understood to be in contention to make his highly anticipated debut within the next week. Amorim's 3-4-3 system offers room for three centre-backs and Yoro is expected to become an undroppable figure in the Portuguese chief's plans. If he is considered fit enough to start after so long on the sidelines, the sight of his name on the teamsheet ahead of kick-off will only increase the excitement levels among supporters.\n\n**Mount starts**\n\nSomething of a forgotten man, the former Chelsea midfielder could be tailor-made for one of the two No.10s in Amorim's set-up. He played a similar role at Stamford Bridge under Thomas Tuchel in the season the Blues won the Champions League. Mount will hope to catch the eye of his current and former manager as he plots a selection path for club and country. The 25-year-old is fit after an injury hit start to the campaign and is back in full training and already impressing Amorim. Footage from training this week showed Mount in the advanced position and Amorim responding well to the England international's showing. While the mitigation is the absence of several players away on international duty and the video being only a snapshot of a session, Mount seems certain to be in the squad on Sunday and find his way into the team.\n\n**Garnacho benched**\n\nAlejandro Garnacho has been something of a shining light for United this season despite not always being in the team. The Argentina international is the top scorer in all competitions with seven goals but was among the subs in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge and could find himself there again at Ipswich. It remains to be seen how Amorim will view the wing-backs in his favoured set-up and whether his preference is to field attack-minded defenders such as Diogo Dalot, or convert wide forwards like Garnacho. \n\nSunday's line-up will offer the first glimpse of the Amorim era and with Garnacho having been away in South America on international duty and therefore being one of the last to arrive back at Carrington, he could be one of the fall-guys.\n\n**Rashford up top**\n\nFor all the talk of Marcus Rashford missing out on a place in Amorim's first XI amid the expectation of Fernandes being pushed into the front three and Amad keeping his place, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Rashford may start in a central position and lead the line. He has started centrally in the past and he has the pace to get in behind Ipswich's centre-backs. Rashford has always maintained he is at his best when starting on the left, cutting inside onto his stronger right foot. He did almost all of his damage from that position when he scored 30 goals in the 2022/23 campaign. Rasmus Hojlund is United's striker-in-chief, meaning almost everyone expects him to start at Portman Road, but he could be extracted from the XI to make room for Rashford. Starting with the latter up front, however, would represent a brave call from Amorim.\n\n**Mainoo overlooked**\n\nAfter missing the last seven matches through injury, pictures of Kobbie Mainoo back in first-team training earlier this week were a welcome sight. The 19-year-old is adored by United supporters and they are desperate to see him back on the pitch as quickly as possible. In his absence in recent weeks, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro took charge of matters in midfield, both impressing during Ruud Van Nistelrooy's stint in interim charge. However, the expectation is that Mainoo will force his way back into the team and attempt to start building an on-field relationship with Ugarte. But in the event of him not being considered quite fit enough to start this weekend, Casemiro could keep his place and operate next to Ugarte again.",

        "headline": "Sporting braced for Manchester United transfer raid on 17-year-old star",
        "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed two weeks ago United are tracking Quenda but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of Manchester City in the Champions League earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the Champions League.\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain Gary Neville after the recent draw with Chelsea.\n\nTottenham's 6-1 and 3-0 victories at United in 2020 and 2024 were underpinned by them exploiting the space behind United's wingers as they left the full backs exposed. Rashford started in both defeats.\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United since February 18. Both are now back in full training. Full backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo, and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

        "article_text": "Sekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

For the players, who were on the periphery under Erik ten Hag, and those who have endured tough spells on the treatment table, they have been afforded the luxury of staking their claim for the new man in charge.\n\nAmorim inherits a squad fresh off a busy summer of spending but also finds himself sifting through an injury list. Harry Maguire is still a few weeks away from first-team action after a calf injury, while Tyrell Malacia made important strides in his recovery from a long-term problem with minutes for the under-21s. \n\nBruno Fernandes returned earlier than expected from Portugal's UEFA Nations League stint, aided by suspension, but the new head coach will welcome returnees in dribs and drabs before Sunday's showdown at Portman Road. Lisandro Martinez was also a returnee during the international break after a back issue flared up while on duty with Lionel Scaloni's Argentina.\n\nEqually, with Luke Shaw, who has stepped up his bid to be a first-team option in recent weeks after a long injury layoff, he too hasn't featured for United this season - with his last game coming back in February, while Mount has played only three times in the Premier League this season. Amorim faces an exciting but also an important period in his early United tenure, and one of the biggest tasks he has is ensuring the players are managed properly to avoid risk of further, longer-term problems, with three selection decisions sticking out already.",

        "article_text": "Robert Lewandowski has spoken out about rumours that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is considering a move away from the club.\n\nZirkzee joined United from Bologna in the summer for a fee of £34 million, penning a five year contract, but so far has failed to make his mark at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, rumours began to circulate that the Dutchman was unhappy with his current situation at United and could be set to leave the club in a surprise return to Serie A.\n\nAnd now, Zirkzee's former teammate Lewandowski has made his feelings about the young striker known and addressed the rumours of his United exit.\n\nThe Barcelona striker appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast and spoke with the ex-United legend about his Bayern Munich teammate's struggles at the Premier League club, urging fans to reserve their judgement and give him more time.\n\n“He plays amazing with the back to the goal. He can hold the ball, he can play with the one or two touches and bring the wingers to behind his back,” Lewandowski said.\n\n“He has also good finishing in the box because he’s big, you know, he’s young, but he’s big and I think he can keep the ball, hold the ball very, very strong.\n\n\"And of course, he needs a little bit of time, it’s normal if you join to this kind of club, big club, with huge expectations and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A.\"\n\nLewandowski also noted that of all of the times to come to join United, last summer was a particularly bad moment as the Red Devils have struggled to find form this season, leaving them 13th in the Premier League table.\n\n“So for him that was like the first season that he was involved, you know, as a typical striker. But you know, that now the time in Manchester is not so brilliant.\n\n“I’m not laughing, but it’s true, you know, because this is a big team. But he’s the striker, he can really help teammates and the team if you know how to use him.\n\n\"Also he can score the goals.

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has signed a new deal with Manchester City, having already confirmed exactly what he will do if the Premier League are found guilty of the 115 charges.\n\nOn Thursday night, City confirmed that the Catalan manager had penned a new two-year deal with the club, extending his stay until 2027.\n\nHaving joined the Manchester club in July 2016, Guardiola's new deal will keep him at the Etihad for more than a decade.\n\nAnd amid the announcement of his extension, the City boss's comments about what he will do if the Premier League champions are found guilty in the hearing for their 115 charges have resurfaced.\n\nIn February last year, City were charged with breaking the Premier League's financial fair play rules over a nine-year period between 2009 and until 2018.\n\nAnd speaking after the details of the charges emerged, Guardiola confirmed that he would stay with the club even if City were found guilty and relegated to a lower division.\n\nSpeaking in August, Guardiola said: \"At the moment we are innocent until it is proved we are guilty I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together.

        "article_text": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has already outlined his plans ahead of the January transfer window, with a left back being the so-called 'priority' position.\n\nAmorim took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Monday ahead of this weekend's much-anticipated Premier League clash against Ipswich Town.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who has penned a two-and-a-half year contract at Old Trafford, got to work on implementing his methods as 10 senior first-team players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount, got the chance to impress.\n\nAfter footage emerged online, we noticed a handful of details in the training session. Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while Luke Shaw was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that Manchester United are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, Liverpool director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.”",

After beginning in September, it is due to last for 10 weeks.\n\nCity 'strenuously' deny all the charges and have said they will robustly defend their position.\n\nPotential punishments for the club if found guilty include heavy fines and even the possibility of relegation from the Premier League, it has been reported. A verdict is not expected to be reached before the end of the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow, talkSPORT presenter Goldstein, who formerly presented Soccer AM and football coverage for Sky Sports, has revealed a 'whisper' he has heard about the case while live-on-air.\n\nHe said: \"I've heard a whisper.

He has been important for me in the first two-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe added: “I hope he stays longer. I like Pep a lot and hope he likes me, too.”\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Real Madrid would be willing to offer €200 million [£166 million] to bring Manchester City's top scorer to the club.\n\nLos Blancos president Florentino Perez is believed to have put a plan in place if Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior leave the Spanish giants, with Haaland seen as the 'chosen one', according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.\n\n\"The possibility of joining Real Madrid, a club with such a rich legacy and boundless ambition, is tempting for any footballer,\" the report adds.",

        "article_text": "**Manchester United have made 'direct contact' with Paris Saint-Germain over a January loan move for one of the most expensive signings in their history.**\n\nIt looks like new manager Ruben Amorim will operate on a modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself. Instead, Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nBut it appears an opportunity has indeed presented itself after United made contact with PSG over a January loan move for Randal Kolo Muani.\n\nKolo Muani, who joined the Ligue 1 side from Eintracht Frankfurt in September last year for £64.2 million plus £12.2 million in add-ons, has struggled to make an impact at the Parc des Princes.\n\nSo far this season, the Frenchman has netted just two goals in 12 appearances for Luis Enrique's side, but it appears he has shown enough for United to make a move.\n\nAccording to Alexis Bernard of Le10sport, the Reds only recently expressed their interest in Muani. The report mentions United 'lacking finances' to make a permanent move, so a loan request has instead been submitted for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt adds: \"Discussions will continue until the end of the year and the choice will be up to the player to 'continue fighting' or try the English adventure, with a brand new coach (Ruben Amorim) who seems to want to trust him.\"\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Telefoot, Kolo Muani expressed his desire to stay and fight for his place at PSG.\n\n\"No, I've never thought about it,\" Muani said when asked about a potential departure.\n\n\"You have to keep the mentality. It's up to me to keep working so that the coach trusts me. That's part of my story. I've always had to work hard, things have never been easy for me. You can't let up.

        "headline": "Gary Neville criticises Marcus Rashford for 'unprofessional' thing he did during international break but Roy Keane disagrees",
        "article_text": "Roy Keane disagreed with former Manchester United teammate Gary Neville after he questioned the professionalism of Marcus Rashford and Casemiro over their actions during the international break.\n\nEarlier this week, Rashford made an eight-hour trip to New York to watch the NBA game between New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward, who has scored four goals in all competitions this season, could be seen courtside with friends before meeting Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson.\n\nCasemiro, meanwhile, enjoyed a family holiday to Disney World. \"Awesome few days in Orlando with family and friends, will be back soon!!!\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Thank you, Orlando.\"\n\nTheir trips to the United States were a big talking point on the latest episode of Stick To Football, brought to you by Sky Bet, as Gary Neville raised eyebrows over what happened.\n\n“The professionalism, looking after your body and making sure you’re best prepared for the next training session is critical to every decision you make during the season,\" Neville said.\n\n\"He [Marcus Rashford] has got a mental break, he’s got to get away and has got to rest with friends - then you talk about the choice of venue, how far do you fly, what’s the time difference, is that going to give a jet lag issue, is that going to give a stiffness issue from being on a flight for 12 hours?\n\n“ This is on Casemiro more than Rashford but if I’m 30 years old and I’m looking after my body – and he’s won five Champions Leagues and is an unbelievable player, but if he was away with Brazil for 10 days, we would say he would struggle this weekend because he’s been away.\n\n\"They [Casemiro and Marcus Rashford] have chosen that international break. If you are talking about the minor details in being as professional as you can be and as prepared you can be for a training session on a Monday night, that isn’t the best choice of venue.”\n\nRoy Keane, however, defended Rashford and Casemiro over their actions.\n\nHe said: “For [Marcus] Rashford and all these lads, going to the United States and going on private jets, whatever they are doing – like basketball, that’s the norm for them. We’re sitting there and going, ‘all the way to the States?’ They [players] would think the States is no big deal.\n\n\"We might consider the long flights and the jet lag, but that is their norm. If they were sitting here, they would say, ‘What are you talking about? This is my life and it’s what I do.'\"\n\nIan Wright also gave his take on whether he would have travelled to the US during an international break.\n\n\"If it’s my time off then yes, I’d do it,\" he said. \"Simply, because it’s my time off. If you’re going for three or four days, that jetlag won’t cause you too much of a problem.”\n\nHe added: “Casemiro and Marcus Rashford are taking a chance that this [travelling 12 hours to the United States for four days] is going to be criticised if they don’t play well - they are accepting what’s to come. It puts you under pressure but then suddenly you can see how quickly it will change.\n\n\"If he [Rashford] doesn’t do well in his first game, and in the next two or three games he scores - nobody cares.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United are said to be 'interested' in a player who has an 'excellent' relationship with newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim, according to reports in Spain.\n\nAmorim, who will take charge of his first United game on Sunday against Ipswich Town, will operate on a more modest budget compared to Erik ten Hag, who spent more than £600 million during his two-and-a-half year tenure.\n\nIn fact, United are 'unlikely to be particularly active' in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, according to the Telegraph, who claim Amorim has been tasked with 'maximising the untapped potential in the squad'.\n\nWith that being said, a report from Spanish publication AS has named United, Manchester City and Real Madrid as those competing to sign Spurs right-back Pedro Porro.\n\nPorro played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, where he notched 12 goals and 20 assists in 98 appearances for the Portuguese club.\n\nIt is claimed that 'those close' to the defender are 'convinced' that the arrival of Amorim will imply an attempt to sign him.\n\nThe report goes on to mention his 'excellent' relationship with the Portuguese coach, who transformed the landscape at Sporting after taking over in 2020, winning two league titles.\n\nSpeaking to Expresso earlier this year, Porro was full of praise for Amorim.\n\n“He is young, has a lot of ambition, a little bit like Ange Postecoglou here at Tottenham,\" the Spanish full-back said. \"He always wants more and that’s what puts him on the world’s lips and coveted by so many teams in Europe,\" Porro added: “He has a special way of working. He plays eye to eye against any opponent, which is also similar to what we do at Tottenham, there are several similarities. It is known and recognised how Sporting and Tottenham play. There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPorro has gone from strength to strength in recent years. After impressing on loan at Spurs, the North London club snapped him up for around £40 million in January 2023.",

David Alaba is also nursing a long-term injury.\n\nBoth clubs may look to bolster their squad in upcoming transfer windows with Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies, 24.\n\nThe Premier League club have ‘already made informal enquiries’ with Davies possibly open to leaving Bayern ‘as a free agent’ next summer, according to Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg.\n\nFrom Davies’ perspective, having two of the world’s biggest clubs reportedly keen on him is an achievement.\n\nThe left-back has played nine Bundesliga games since Vincent Kompany took charge of the Bavarians but could look to move on when his current Bayern contract expires this summer.\n\nIf he were to move to United, he would provide competition for first-choice Luke Shaw as well as Tyrell Malacia, who is still returning to fitness after a prolonged period out.\n\nIf Madrid was his chosen destination, Davies would be competing for a starting spot against Carlo Ancelotti’s preferred starting left-back, Ferland Mendy, as well as backup option Fran Garcia.\n\nDavies' agent recently issued an update on his client’s situation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\n“Done deal with Real Madrid? This is NOT true,” Nedal Huoseh explained on November 15.\n\n“Though the player has many options, we have not agreed terms with any club.\n\n“A new deal at FC Bayern could also be an option.

Some of them are calling him Mourinho 2.0.”\n\nAmorim’s ‘confidence’ is backed up by his impressive record in his native Portugal.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped Sporting secure their first title in 19 years when he led them to the 2020/21 Primeira Liga crown before adding a second league trophy in 2023/24.\n\nUnderstandably, many United fans are looking at Amorim as the man who could restore the club to the glory days of the past; the Premier League is a tougher place to thrive than Portugal’s top flight.\n\nAmorim insisted he and his players will need “time” to find success at the club when speaking during his first interview with Manchester United’s official website on November 15.\n\n\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim explained.\n\n“To win time is to win games.\n\n“But the most important thing for me is identity.\n\n\"So, from day one, we will start with our identity.\n\n“The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.",

De Rossi, who is a long-time admirer of Keane, credited him as one of the reasons he, too, wore the number 16 during his playing days. “He’s my all-time idol,” the Italian told AS Roma’s official website in 2016.\n\n“Besides Gaia (my daughter, who was born on the 16th), I wear 16 because of him.”",

        "article_text": "Jermaine Jenas' wife Ellie Penfold has spoken out after her husband was sacked by the BBC following complaints about workplace conduct.\n\nAn official statement from the BBC confirmed that Jenas had been taken off presenting duties for both The One Show and Match of the Day due to alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n\nJenas later admitted to sending 'inappropriate messages' to two of his BBC colleagues, though clarified that they were not sexual and that he did 'nothing illegal'.\n\nAnd now, Jenas' wife has finally broken her silence on the scandal and revealed how it has impacted her and her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penfold appeared at the launch of her personal care brand Preppy, a specialist range for children and teens, and spoke about the scandal involving her husband.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Penfold said: “It has been an incredibly hard and difficult time for myself and my family.\n\n“My only focus has been on our children and building my brand Preppy.\n\n“Now I just want to move forward.\n\n“Naturally this has been hard for me but my only concern has been our children and that will not change.”\n\nDespite appearing at the launch without her wedding ring, Penfold added that Jenas was completely supportive of her new businesses and was looking forward to seeing where it could go in the future.\n\n\"I have been working on this brand for three years and it is something I am incredibly proud of,” she added.\n\n\"Jermaine is excited for the business and what it holds for me in the future.\n\n“He has been supportive of me in this respect and as a working mum.”\n\nWhen details of the scandal became public in August, Jenas spoke about how it had impacted him and his relationship with his wife Ellie.\n\nHe said: “I was in shock at the time, there was a lot to process. But I’m the married one, I’m at fault.\n\n“The overriding panic by a mile was that I could lose my family.\n\n“There’s something in me that’s praying there is some level of mercy or understanding of the fact we’re human beings and we all make mistakes, some bigger than others and mine is a big mistake.”\n\n“Ellie is absolutely raging. She’s human.\n\n“When I see her now, she is just making sure the children are okay.",

I’ve seen us lose better players going back to Rush leaving for Juventus. We’ve always kicked on.”\n\nA second added: “It's obvious he's going, what I'm interested in is when he's gonna announce it. And what impact it has on our run-in, given that it won't go down well and the Klopp announcement last season derailed us.”\n\nWith a third saying: “It's just advertising for a brand that has nothing to do with football... Move on.”\n\nHowever, the Liverpool Echo explained how the advert was not linked to any potential move to Real Madrid, with the billboard also seen in Italy and the Netherlands previously.",

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before Amorim made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age of 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n\"I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year.

Marcos church in Coimbra, holds a degree in telecommunications engineering and now runs her own interior design business.\n\nIn fact, she runs the business called Dois Ton with Raquel; the wife of Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana.\n\nThe Athletic's Charlotte Harpur recently spent a week speaking to Amorim's family and friends to gain an insight into the new Manchester United manager.\n\n\"It's his charisma, it's his smile,\" Harpur told talkSPORT. \"It's very easy to say, but when you interact with him, just from a media perspective, it's fresh and it is different, especially in contrast to Erik ten Hag.\n\n\"I think you can always get a bit carried away.

        "headline": "Man Utd have player who is 'impossible to ignore' as Ruben Amorim told to take immediate action",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has been told about a player in the Manchester United ranks who is \"impossible to ignore\" as he prepares to take charge of his first game. After succeeding Erik ten Hag as the next United head coach, Amorim has some big decisions to make in the coming months when it comes to team selection. Amad Diallo is set for a 'prominent' role under the new manager, according to journalist Dean Jones, who says Amorim is 'excited' by the winger's technical ability, work off the ball, and creativity in the final third. We will get more of an insight into his thinking on Sunday afternoon, when United travel to Portman Road to take on newly-promoted Ipswich Town. But ahead of the Premier League clash, Amorim has been urged to take a look at one of their academy prospects. Earlier this week, United under-21s maintained their unbeaten record in the National League Cup with a 4-0 win over Altrincham as highly-rated striker Ethan Ennis scored a hat-trick. Ennis, who joined the Reds from Liverpool in 2021, becoming the first player in 57 years to do so, has netted nine goals and two assists in 12 academy appearances this season. And the 19-year-old forward has been tipped to push for a spot in the first-team by Steven Railston of the Manchester Evening News. \"So what you might be wondering, could Ennis be pushing to make his first-team debut? The answer is he should be,\" he said. \"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first-team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\" Ennis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. Back in August, the MEN reported: \"He will continue to be an integral U21 player and could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.\"",

Dide has been able to keep things under wraps but has pulled back the curtain ever so slightly, opening up about how he balances being a football and musician at the same time.\n\nIn April he said Kevin De Bruyne is the best player he has played against before claiming his teammates and manager had no idea about his hustle on the side.\n\nEddie Nketiah, Wilfried Zaha, Reiss Nelson and Alex Iwobi were just some of the many suggestions fans have come up with but some also 'outed' Sheyi Ojo, who Liverpool bought for a fee of £2 million when he was just 14.\n\nOjo, a member of England's Under 20 World Cup-winning squad in 2017, played 13 times for the Reds and left for Cardiff City in 2022 after a number of loan spells, including Wolves, Fulham, Rangers and Reims.\n\nHe signed a two-year deal with Slovenian side NK Maribor in September but in a new interview with The Athletic, Ojo was asked if he is actually Dide.\n\nAnd he was happy to dismiss talk of it being him as he would not be one to put 'anything else in the picture to sway my concentration'.\n\n\"It’s funny because everywhere I go people ask me about it but honestly I haven’t got a clue who it is,\" Ojo said.\n\n\"All I can say is I’m super focused on football as I always have been, that’s pretty much the only thing that matters to me.

She is rumoured to be earning a joint-record £1.5 million for heading into the jungle and has already been discussing her relationship with one of the Premier League's best ever players.\n\nAnd the row with Vardy has been reignited, with plenty of jibes being made by hosts Ant and Dec and Coleen briefly talking about the 'Wagatha Christie' 2022 trial.\n\nRebekah, a former I'm a Celeb contestant back in 2017, couldn't help but respond on Instagram, writing: \"That feeling when you are living rent free in people's heads [laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe 42-year-old is serving as a columnist for The Sun on jungle affairs and in a video doing the rounds, described Coleen as \"the gift that keeps on giving\" after her boat sank twice in episode one.\n\nFans have wondered what Leicester City striker Vardy thinks about his other half's antics but according to Rebekah, he doesn't mind it at all and is supportive of her actions.\n\nThe mum of five also claimed any abuse subjected to him on the pitch spurs him on.\n\n\"Everyone thinks Jamie is mad at me for speaking out, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,\" she said, as per The Mirror.\n\n\"He’s encouraging me, saying, ‘Give it to her, get the truth out there’.

        "article_text": "A German football expert has ‘tipped’ Liverpool to sign one of Mohamed Salah’s Egypt teammates.\n\nArne Slot’s side are currently in fine form, having won 15 of their first 17 games since the Dutchman took over from Jurgen Klopp for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nDespite their successful start to the campaign, one of the first challenges Slot faced as Liverpool boss was the lack of new players that arrived at the club ahead of the season, with just Federico Chiesa and Giorgi Mamardashvili coming in – who was loaned back to Valencia until the end of the season.\n\nHowever, next summer, they could be in the market for a Bundesliga forward who happens to be Mo Salah’s Egypt teammate.\n\nOmar Marmoush, 25, has been in impressive form for Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season - netting 11 times in just ten league games to go alongside seven assists.\n\nThe forward was heavily linked with a Premier League move in the summer transfer window with Nottingham Forest reported to be interested - but no such deal materialised.\n\nBut the player is expected to make a move this summer if his excellent form in the German topflight continues, and the Bundesliga expert has all but confirmed the possibility of a transfer to Liverpool.\n\n“It’s no secret that he will probably move to Liverpool next summer,” journalist and pundit Marcel Reif explained. “I would put a few euros on it. As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017. He showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich. The player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, Frankfurt’s sporting director Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That amount won't be enough,” Krosche said. “It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself. That's an agreement we make with the players.",

        "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
        "article_text": "Højlund has chance to impress Amorim, Villa look to end miserable month and will Forest trouble Arsenal?\n\n1\n\nDewsbury-Hall back on familiar ground\nAfter masterminding Leicester’s return to the Premier League, Enzo Maresca jumped ship to Chelsea. The Italian had given little confidence he would stay at the King Power, despite his success amid problems in the background and the lure of London. Maresca did, however, ensure he took one thing with him in the form of the central midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, a leading light in the Foxes’ promotion charge. While Maresca has impressed at Stamford Bridge, Dewsbury-Hall is yet to find his feet and has been limited to a cup-player role. Of his 10 appearances for Chelsea, only three have been in the league and none from the start. It might be time to show some faith in him and there is no better place to do so than his old home. Dewsbury-Hall rose through the ranks at Leicester and his £30m transfer fee this summer was highly beneficial to their accounts after financial problems. Leicester fans will welcome back Maresca and Dewsbury-Hall with open arms, the embrace the latter might need to kickstart his Chelsea career.\n\n2\n\nO’Riley can be pivotal to Brighton\nMatt O’Riley endured a tough start to his Brighton career when he suffered an ankle injury caused by a poor challenge nine minutes into his debut in the Carabao Cup against Crawley. The midfielder missed the following three months but showed his worth on his return to help transform the game against Manchester City and score the winner. Fabian Hürzeler and Brighton earmarked O’Riley as the man required in midfield to sit alongside Carlos Baleba, who has been struggling with a knee problem, and they could be paired from the start at Bournemouth. Brighton have not missed O’Riley much, starting the weekend in sixth. Baleba is 20 and O’Riley 24, meaning they could be a long-term partnership. That is not often the way at Brighton but if they perform as hoped the pair could provide the foundation for another push for European football while increasing their value.\n\n3\n\nCan Forest repeat Anfield heist?\nArsenal have picked up two points from 12 available over the past four games and are in a tricky spot. The prospect of facing the side immediately below them, who are yet to lose away all season, is a daunting one. Nottingham Forest are the only team to have defeated Liverpool this season, proving they have the cunning and quality to topple title contenders. At Anfield, Forest’s success came about by packing the midfield and stopping Liverpool from playing with fluidity. It would seem Nuno might do similar to prevent Martin Ødegaard from pulling the strings. Forest’s manager has proven his intelligence when it comes to stifling opponents, while possessing a potent attacking threat. After losing to Newcastle, Nuno will want a reaction from his players. If he can get it to resemble the performance at Anfield he could be managing a top-four team by Saturday evening.\n\n4\n\nWill Villa’s miserable month continue?\nA winless month – including four consecutive defeats – has taken the wind out of Aston Villa’s sails. Such patterns are not unknown for Unai Emery; his teams can blow hot and cold. That grim run has betrayed the fatigue of coming so far so fast and suggested that opposition managers may be cracking the Villa code. Emery’s high-risk football, when it falters, can often look one-dimensional as Villa did in successive chastening defeats to Tottenham and Liverpool. With Ollie Watkins making an international breakthrough, and Morgan Rogers getting his first cap, Emery will hope for a lift in morale. Oliver Glasner, with fewer resources at Crystal Palace than Emery, has hit on similar problems, having initially been so successful last season. It still comes as a surprise to see Palace in the bottom three. Eberechi Eze and Adam Wharton recovering fitness and form could be key for the Austrian manager.\n\n5\n\nEverton need to freshen up their game\nThis could be the final home game of the dreadful Farhad Moshiri era for Everton, with the Friedkin Group hoping that Premier League approval on their proposed takeover is close. A fresh start awaits – hopefully, as the club is in desperate need of one – and the same applies to Sean Dyche’s approach. He has made the team hard to beat but increasingly hard to watch; Everton are without a goal in their last two games. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has not scored in his last seven starts yet continues to keep Beto on the bench despite the Guinea-Bissau international offering the team a rare goal threat as a substitute. Calvert-Lewin could, in fairness, point to a desperate lack of quality service. Change is required, either at centre-forward or in the supply line, and while Brentford have lost all five league away games this season it must be noted those defeats have come at Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham, Manchester United and to two goals in stoppage time at Fulham.\n\n6\n\nBerge helps fill Fulham’s Palhinha void\nIt would not have been a surprise if Fulham had dropped off after selling João Palhinha to Bayern Munich. To their credit, though, they have managed to absorb the loss of the tough-tackling Portugal midfielder. Sasa Lukic, the Serbia international, caught the eye at the start of the season and Sander Berge has done well since breaking into the starting lineup last month. Berge was a canny buy. The Norwegian joined Sheffield United for £22m in 2020 and was relegated 18 months later. He was influential in the Championship, won promotion, joined Burnley and was relegated again last season. Fulham could give the 26-year-old stability. Berge will hope to make his sixth consecutive start when Marco Silva’s high-flying side host Wolves.\n\n7\n\nPep stays on but City must improve\nWhen does a feelgood vibe remain at a club despite a dismal four-game losing streak? Answer: when Manchester City and their all-time great manager, Pep Guardiola, have just agreed a new one-year deal. City look to arrest their slide against Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou’s off-the-cuff attacking unit will suit City. A side mocked as “Doctor Tottenham” – the joke being they provide the cure for a needy side’s ills – have the pace to get in behind the champions’ high line and damage them, too. A fifth consecutive reverse would cast the champions in crisis and have some (misguided) fans questioning the prudency of the Guardiola extension.\n\n8\n\nBottom meets top on south coast\nThere is already a 24-point gap between bottom and top as Southampton prepare to face Liverpool. Trying to find hope for Russell Martin’s side going into this fixture is tricky. At Wolves they failed to have a shot on target despite having 72% possession and they will not dominate the ball in the same manner on Sunday. Southampton’s style is about passing and patient buildup and it is unlikely Martin will ever change, even if the club’s Premier League status and his employment are at risk. All teams need an element of surprise, whether they are first or last, in order to keep opponents guessing, but Southampton’s predictability is their downfall and explains why they are bottom. Reacting when something is not working is a sign of a good coach. If Martin can bring himself to be more direct with the speed of his wingers and strikers, they could spring a much-needed upset.\n\n9\n\nHøjlund to fill Gyökeres role for Amorim?\nAmid all the fanfare surrounding Rúben Amorim, the key question is whether he will implement his favoured 3-4-3 formation and what personnel he could use to do so. At Sporting, Amorim was highly reliant on the quality of Viktor Gyökeres as his lone striker and will almost certainly give that role to Rasmus Højlund on Sunday as the only suitable player in the squad. The Danish international has shown his potential in flashes at United but needs to become more consistent. Højlund needs help in achieving this but he has some similar characteristics to Gyökeres. The Swede was not the finished article when he left Coventry for Sporting but is now one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, partly thanks to Amorim’s support. Quick and strong, Højlund has a similar profile but two goals in 12 appearances this season is not good enough to keep him in the starting lineup in the long term. Amorim might be just the man to help him.\n\n10\n\nLopetegui is on the brink\nMight this be Julen Lopetegui’s last stand? West Ham’s beleaguered manager could probably do without facing an improving Newcastle team fresh from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. England’s Jarrod Bowen will hope to impress in the north-east and ranks high on Eddie Howe’s January shopping list. The number of future visits West Ham might make to St James’ Park is currently a sensitive issue; while most Newcastle fans have indicated a preference for the club remaining at the stadium, the club’s Saudi ownership are currently exploring the idea of building a brand new ground, possibly four miles outside the city centre near the Gosforth Park racecourse. A decision is expected to be announced early in the New Year. Who knows where Lopetegui, or West Ham, will be by then.",

        "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Rúben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
        "article_text": "Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

        "headline": "Golden Goal: Brian McClair for Manchester United v Sheffield Wednesday (1991",
        "article_text": "It may have been an absolute mess, but McClair’s two-yard wonder strike was a window into the human soul\n\nThe reality of corporeality is a hard thing to process; just look at what we look like! But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nThere’s a truism in comedy that a good visual gag spanks a good verbal gag, so please now pause and enjoy the moment as nature intended it.\n\nI can tell you what happened next if you like, in case you’re the kind of person who’d ask Joseph Heller about his second novel, or who hears Be My Baby and wonders about the B-side. United missed chances to forge further in front with Kanchelskis – wearing number eight – spurning the opportunity to open his account for the club. Then Jemson, on as sub, scored his first in the league for Wednesday, and when Schmeichel denied him with one of the great futile saves – he’d pull off an even better one against Arsenal in November 1998 – Neil Webb flicked on the resultant corner, as if doing so deliberately, for Jemson to head home the winner.\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

        "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Rúben Amorim",
        "article_text": "Rúben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!”",

        "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane. Susanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy has left his role as assistant coach after the arrival of Rúben Amorim at Manchester United. The Dutchman oversaw three wins and a draw in interim charge after the sacking of Erik ten Hag but will not be part of the new era at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, a former United striker, returned to the club in the summer to work under Ten Hag, having left Old Trafford 18 years ago. He had suggested a willingness to stay under Amorim and see out the 18 months on his deal. United also confirmed the exit of his fellow coaches René Hake, Jelle ten Rouwelaar and Pieter Morel.\n\nUnited said: “Ruud is, and always will be, a Manchester United legend. We are grateful for his contribution and the way in which he has approached his role throughout his time with the club. He will always be very welcome at Old Trafford.”\n\nAmorim has his own trusted coaches from Sporting and, although his backroom staff are yet to be confirmed, it is anticipated that he will be joined by Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, the goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and the sports scientist Paulo Barreira.\n\nAmorim arrived in England on Monday afternoon and immediately visited the club’s training ground but is awaiting his visa that will allow him to start work.\n\nAmorim was greeted by United’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and technical director, Jason Wilcox. Although not permitted to take training, Amorim is allowed to attend the club’s facilities and hold meetings. United are expecting the process of securing a visa to be quick now Amorim is in the country and the paperwork is under way and that he will be able to take training once the majority of the squad return from representing their countries.\n\nAmorim’s toughest task will be getting United to understand and adapt to his tactics, according to the defender Matthijs de Ligt. Amorim is expected to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation, a considerable change from the 4-2-3-1 used by Ten Hag and Van Nistelrooy.\n\n“I think a back three or a back four, it’s in general the same – the only thing of importance is how the team is set up,” De Ligt said. “You can play in a back three but if everything is not compact and everybody is doing their own job then it’s going to be really difficult, the same in a back four.

        "headline": "Ten talking points from the weekend football",
        "article_text": "Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer.\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.”\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.”\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.”\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it.\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out.\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break.\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks.\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating.\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer.",

        "article_text": "Rúben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”",

        "headline": "Van Nistelrooy in dark over Manchester United future under Amorim",
        "article_text": "Ruud van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th of 36 in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now [to see if Amorim has messaged] – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want [for] my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room, it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put a big performance in.\n\n“The first half [against Paok] wasn’t good. We hardly created anything and Paok neither. We didn’t get going and our possession wasn’t good enough and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good, it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

        "headline": "Amad Diallo ends Manchester United’s European drought by seeing off Paok",
        "article_text": "Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more games without winning in last season’s Champions League.\n\nSo a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever 50th-minute header. The second an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the defender’s manhandling, then fired a shot into the left corner, via a deflection.\n\nAs Ruud van Nistelrooy, United’s interim manager, said: “The second goal had everything in it that for me is Amad Diallo. He fought to take the ball off the Paok defender, pushed through to get the shot, and had the quality to curl it round the goalkeeper.”\n\nBut, prior to that moment, United lacked the ability to kill off Paok well before the close and cruise along in control. Rúben Amorim should know this but United’s incoming manager, if watching, will comprehend the size of the challenge to transform the group he takes over on Monday.\n\nUnited’s results in continental competition this season were 1-1 against Twente, 3-3 at Porto and 1-1 at Fenerbahce. Hardly a roll of honour and when Van Nistelrooy rotated Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt for Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf in central defence, and Diallo for Marcus Rashford in attack, you wondered whether three points would finally be garnered.\n\nThe first half suggested not. Razvan Lucescu configured his Greek champions in a 4-2-3-1 that was a carbon copy of Van Nistelrooy’s shape and Mady Camara, the visiting No 10, exposed a familiar faultline when running into a gap, passing, collecting later in the move, then shooting.\n\nCamara was the Paok equivalent of Bruno Fernandes: a playmaker adept at materialising in pockets and running his team. United’s captain did this when popping up at the left angle of Paok’s area and threading the ball to Diallo, whose cross was cleared. Then came a buccaneering sequence reminiscent of a Sir Alex Ferguson vintage.\n\nDiallo jinked about infield, fed Noussair Mazraoui, who switched the ball back into space on the right. This invited Casemiro to run on and hit an instant delivery to the far post where Alejandro Garnacho headed against Jonny’s arm, but a corner rather than penalty was Radu Petrescu’s decision. The referee – and VAR – made the same call later when Diallo went down under Baba’s challenge.\n\nDiallo was United’s bright light. His next act was to drop the ball on to Rasmus Højlund’s head but, twisting, the centre-forward’s header was insipid. A 65% possession rate showed the home team’s dominance. As usual, the problem was execution in the final third. Earlier, Garnacho fluffed a regulation pass to an overlapping colleague in Paok’s area. Now he offered a repeat, again following a burst through an inside-left channel: this time, Diogo Dalot missed.\n\nPaok lurked, waiting to pounce on any United slipshodness. Such as when the lightweight Manuel Ugarte was bullied around the halfway line, leading to Andrija Zivkovic hammering a dipping 20-yard effort into André Onana’s clutches.\n\nHere was a hint that United might suffer if their profligacy was not cured. Diallo was inches from doing so when hurling himself at a Garnacho cross. But he, not the ball, ended in the goal, Baba scrambling it away.\n\nAs they headed for the break – nearly behind due to a Camara rocket that burned Onana’s fingertips when deflecting over – toothless was the report on United’s opening 45 minutes. Impotency, too, is the tale of their campaign thus far. Van Nistelrooy, a ruthless assassin when United’s striker, needed to address this when his troops trailed off for the interval refreshments.\n\nYet more of the same followed. Garnacho did manage to locate Dalot on the overlap this time but the latter failed to find Fernandes as he arrived in Paok’s area. Fernandes showed the defender how it is done, as United discovered ruthlessness at last. Along the left, Garnacho glanced up and tapped to his captain who chipped in a precise ball that had the excellent Diallo leaping and looping a header back across goal which wrongfooted Dominik Kotarski, the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nFernandes was United’s hub. Next, he created for Diallo once more with a curving through ball: the forward ran in but saw his attempt saved. United were serving up another smorgasbord of chances, but too many were spurned. Dalot blazed over, Fernandes did the same, and in between Garnacho went to ground in the penalty area under the attentions of Tomasz Kedziora and Jonny, and once more Petrescu’s judgment of no spot-kick was dubious.\n\nTarik Tissoudali gave United a fright near goal but his nerve failed and he unloaded a shot straight into Onana’s gloves. Soon after Diallo’s second he hurt his leg and was replaced despite appearing to be fine. United will hope so ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.",

        "headline": "Onana claims Manchester United will ‘step up’ for arrival of Rúben Amorim",
        "article_text": "André Onana has backed his Manchester United teammates to “step up” and adapt to Rúben Amorim’s style after watching Sporting defeat Manchester City 4-1 in the Champions League. Amorim, who will arrive in England next week to replace Erik ten Hag, prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.\n\n“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s Europa League game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them [Sporting], by the way. Different system, but the players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”\n\nUnited have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester and a league draw against Chelsea but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim about the team or his future.\n\nOnana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”\n\nOne player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”\n\nUnited have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.",

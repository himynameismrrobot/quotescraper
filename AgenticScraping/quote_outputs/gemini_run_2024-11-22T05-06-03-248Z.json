      "article_text": "Il **Milan** del presente continua a parlare americano e il suo Capitan America, **Christian Pulisic** continua ad essere un elemento cardine fondamentale di questa squadra. 7 gol e 5 assist in 15 presenze fra campionato e Champions League e un ruolo da autentico trascinatore pur nelle difficoltà che, inevitabilmente, Paulo Fonseca sta trovando in questi primi 3 mesi di gestione. **Prestazioni importantissime che non sono passate inosservate** a chi, dall'ex-Chelsea e Borussia Dortmund, si aspettava una nuova esplosione e che, inevitabilmente, stanno riaccendendo le sirene del mercato su di lui.  \n  \n**SIRENE DALLA PREMIER -** Proprio dalla **Premier League** che è stata sua stanno arrivando i richiami più importanti. Arrivato a Milano dal **Chelsea** lo scorso 13 luglio 2023, non sono i Blues, in prima fila per provare a riportarlo in Inghilterra. **Pulisic piace invece tantissimo al Liverpool**, con il futuro del fantasista USA che si intreccia inevitabilmente con il possibile addio anticipato di Federico Chiesa di ritorno in Serie A (il Milan c'è, ma anche l'Inter), e anche a **Manchester United** e **West Ham** di Amorim e Lopetegui che sono alla ricerca di un colpo di livello top per risollevare una classifica deficitaria ma con un posto Champions ancora ampiamente alla portata.  \n**LE CIFRE UFFICIALI -** Per il Milan, va detto, **oggi Pulisic è insostituibile e anche incedibile, ma sappiamo come la politica dei fondi di investimento, e RedBird non fa eccezione, sia quella di monetizzare** di fronte ad offerte importantissime. I rossoneri prelevarono Pulisic dal Chelsea per **20,8 milioni di euro** facendogli firmare un contratto in **scadenza 30 giugno 2027 da 4 milioni di euro netti annui** (6,32 al lordo) e con opzione di rinnovo annuale in favore della società.  \n  \n**QUANTO VALE -** Un investimento, va detto, sicuramente contenuto in rapporto all'impatto che Pulisic sta avendo a Milano e che oggi pone il Milan in una posizione di predominanza sul mercato. Sicuramente il valore è cresciuto incredibilmente ed **è tornato ad avvicinarsi alla valutazione che ne fece il Chelsea, oltre 60 milioni, quando lo acquistò dal Borussia Dortmund.** È questa la cifra, destinata a salire ancora se continuerà così, da cui RedBird inizierà ad ascoltare proposte. **Un discorso diverso, invece, lo può fare il calciatore dato che 4 milioni di euro è una cifra incredibilmente alla portata di molti top club,** soprattutto in Premier League. Gennaio è ancora lontano, offerte concrete ancora non ne sono arrivate, saprà Zlatan Ibrahimovic resistere a tutte le avance per la sua stella americana?  \n   \n[Tutti gli AGGIORNAMENTI in TEMPO REALE!

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget to former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag, and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad.",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is set to operate on a more modest budget to Erik ten Hag at [Manchester United](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/manchester-united-fc/) and will be tasked with maximising the untapped potential in the squad as the club aim to end the damaging and costly cycle of mass overhauls.\n\nThe new United hierarchy have no plans under Amorim to rip up a squad they feel is capable of delivering far more and are determined to move away from a culture of persistent upheaval they believe to be financially unsustainable and destructive to coherent squad building.\n\nDenmark striker Rasmus Hojlund and England midfielder Mason Mount are cited as just two examples of players United are hoping can thrive in a new environment under the charismatic Portuguese, who will take charge of his first game as [the club’s new head coach](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/15/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-players-stadium-tour/) away to Ipswich Town on Sunday. Amorim took official charge of his first training session with United on Monday.\n\nUnited have averaged five new signings every summer for the past 10 years under four different managers with vastly different ideas of how they want to play. All have had little success to show for the huge expenditure.\n\nWhile Amorim is expected to be operating under a more modest transfer budget next summer than his predecessor Ten Hag did during his 2½-year reign, when he spent more than £600 million, United want to implement a more sustainable structure where waste is limited, the churn of players greatly reduced and more talent realised.\n\nUnited hope Amorim can inject new lease of life\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nUnited feel there are plenty of players in the squad who, with better coaching, attention and support in the right system and set-up, have a much higher ceiling than they may have shown previously, and the club [hope Amorim can unlock that potential](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/06/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-five-tactical-masterstrokes/).\n\nEqually, there is a feeling there may be more experienced players who also stand to benefit considerably from Amorim’s arrival and others who find they are given a new lease of life in potentially reimagined roles.\n\nWith losses before tax totalling £312.9 million over the past three seasons, United are under huge pressure to reduce costs to ensure continued compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and Uefa’s own financial sustainability regulations.\n\nThose pressures will become more acute if the club miss out on Champions League qualification for a second successive season and, with it, the vast broadcast revenues that come with playing in Europe’s premier club competition. In that scenario, United would also face a financial penalty under the terms of their kit deal with Adidas.\n\nUnited, who shed 250 staff jobs in the summer, are continuing to review costs across all areas of the club as they strive to reduce those losses. That includes the possibility of cutting in half the cash they give to the Manchester United Disabled Supporters’ Association, although there is no certainty at this stage that will happen.\n\nThe wider financial challenges will ensure a pressing need for United to sell well to raise money to reinvest next year and a sensible approach to buying after years of transfer-market failures and scattergun spending that have left little room for manoeuvre. Old Trafford sources insist it is imperative the club move away from the wasteful, inefficient transfer approach of the past and the cumulative damage of repeat mistakes by building a more sustainable model and structure.\n\nUnited are unlikely to be particularly active in the January transfer window unless an opportunity presents itself, players leave or injuries or other factors create a problem that has to be addressed.\n\nAmorim given time to assess his squad\n-------------------------------------\n\nBut Dan Ashworth, the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, the technical director and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will give Amorim time to assess the squad and see how players adapt to his approach and methods before they start to make any definitive plans for next summer’s window and the type of players and areas they might want to target to supplement what is already there – in addition to who may go.\n\nChristian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all out of contract next summer, as are Harry Maguire and Amad Diallo, although the club have options to extend both of those players’s deals by another 12 months.\n\nCasemiro and Tyrell Malacia enter the final 12 months of their contracts at the end of the season but with options for another year. Chelsea have an obligation to buy England winger Jadon Sancho, [who is currently on loan at Stamford Bridge](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/08/30/transfer-deadline-day-live-man-u-arsenal-liverpool-chelsea/), next summer so long as the west-London club finish in the top 14 of the Premier League this season.\n\nAmorim takes over a United side who are 13th in the Premier League, albeit just four points off the top four, after the club’s poor start to the season under Ten Hag.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, the Dutchman’s interim replacement, who has since left the club, helped to stabilise results during a four-game spell in charge, which included a 1-1 draw against Chelsea and 3-0 win over Leicester City in the league.\n\nAmorim spoke on Friday about playing “without fear” from day one and “winning time” and patience through victories and establishing a clear identity and idea that the fans can recognise and get behind.\n\nThe 39-year-old is expected to implement a change of system by adopting a 3-4-2-1 or 3-4-3 formation, systems that brought him considerable success at Sporting.\n\nSeveral players whom Ten Hag was unable to call on this season are moving closer to first-team returns, including summer signing Leny Yoro and left-backs Luke Shaw and Malacia, while Amorim will soon hope to have the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Maguire back after muscle injuries. There are fitness concerns, though, over Lisandro Martinez, who had to withdraw from the Argentina squad last week.",

Tutti vogliono Osi, ma a prezzo ragionevole: come il Manchester United che mette sul piatto il clamoroso scambio con Joshua Zirkzee, rivelazione dell'ultima serie A con il Bologna ma in Premier considerato un bidone. Un'operazione da imbandire nelle prossime settimana. Il Napoli ha delle perplessità: vuole solo cash, non vuole scambi. Ma questo novembre pieno zeppo di gol ha rilanciato i sogni del nigeriano. Dunque, la svolta Osimhen potrebbe già esserci nella sessione invernale: non la plusvalenza sognata ma in ogni caso una cifra niente male. Ma con Osimhen, prima di dare un affare come concluso bisogna aspettare. Anche perché l'ingaggio da 12 milioni netti pesa (e non poco) sulle trattative. Lo scrive Il Mattino.",

He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left.\n\nYoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City.\n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week.

      "article_text": "Sporting expect Manchester United to make an offer for winger Geovany Quenda next year.\n\nQuenda, 17, only made his Sporting debut in August and he was named in the Portugal squad for their Nations League draw with Croatia this week. The _Manchester Evening News_ revealed two weeks ago [United are tracking Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-tracking-sporting-winger-30311097) but they are yet to submit a formal bid. Sources say United have been following Quenda's progress since the start of the season and he is under contract at Sporting until 2027.\n\nThe left-footed Quenda played on the right wing under new United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting. He assisted Viktor Gyokeres for his equaliser in the Portuguese champions’ 4-1 thrashing of [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) earlier this month.\n\nBorn in Guinea-Bissau, Quenda has only made 18 appearances for Sporting and Portuguese sources have likened his talent and work ethic to Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka. Quenda, previously in Benfica's academy until he switched to Sporting's at the age of 12, was named in the club's matchday squad by Amorim as a 16-year-old last year. He became the club's youngest league scorer against Famalicão last month, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and is Sporting's youngest player to start in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).\n\nAmorim will transfer his 3-4-3 formation to United, who could have issues with incorporating their wide players into the system. Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford prefer to operate higher up the pitch and were accused of not tracking back by former United captain [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) after the recent draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc).\n\nUnited have not been able to play a senior left back for the majority of the calendar year as Tyrell Malacia last appeared for the club in May 2023 and Luke Shaw has not played for United on February 18. Both are now back in full training.\n\nFull backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can operate on either side but both are accustomed to operating in a back four. Left-footed right winger Amad is a potential option for Amorim, who must also decide if £85million flop Antony is in his plans.\n\nUnited famously signed Ronaldo from Sporting in 2003. The club also recruited Nani, Marcos Rojo and Bruno Fernandes from the Portuguese side.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United make Sekou Kone plan after midfielder's injury scare - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nMan United signed Malian Sekou Kone in the summer and the midfielder has an exciting future at Old Trafford.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

The new manager will bring fresh ideas and a new motivation which Rashford needs to use to rediscover his best form because he hasn’t been enjoying his football.\n> \n> \"His body language under Erik ten Hag was not of a player who enjoyed playing and those were not good signs, he needs to buy into the new system because if he doesn’t he will be moved on by Amorim. It’s up to both the player and the manager but predominantly Rashford, he’s on huge money but sometimes that isn’t enough motivation. When I was working at United, the big intrinsic motivation was one, to play for Manchester United and number two, to be successful at Manchester United. It was all about winning.\n> \n> \"It's all about winning games, all about winning trophies and that motivation, it comes from within. That is already a coping mechanism to deal with when things are not going that well. Rashford isn’t a young player anymore and he has to live up to expectations and find that desire and passion to play for United again, or he’ll have a problem and might be looking for a new club.\"\n\n(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\n\n22:09Bruna Reis\n\n### Manchester United 'hold talks' over January transfer that Erik ten Hag wanted in 2023\n\nManchester United have reportedly held talks with Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani over a potential loan move in the January transfer window.\n\nAccording to [Le10 Sport](https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-psg-une-demande-de-pret-pour-kolomuani-721954), initial talks have taken place to bring Kolo Muani to the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) when the January transfer window opens.

The Arsenal legend said: \"Marcus Rashford was clearly not the first-choice in attack under Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n\"So he has to turn things around under Amorim. If he is unable to do that, I think United have a big problem. Rashford's wages are going to become an issue if they want to move him on. I don't know who buys him at the moment.

The 29-year-old, who beat teenage sensation Luke Littler to become the champion of the world for the first time back in January, was pictured alongside the likes of [Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) and [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville).\n\nIn an Instagram post, Humphries, the current darting world number one, shared six separate images of him in The Overlap studio with \"some of the best footballers to have played the game\". The first photo showed Humphries alongside Keane, Jill Scott and Ian Wright, while Neville, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and comedian Michael McIntyre featured in some of the other shots.\n\nHumphries, who boasts 231,000 followers, said: \"Had a great time filming on the [@wearetheoverlap](https://www.instagram.com/wearetheoverlap/) today with some of the best footballers to have played the game,\" followed by a fist pumping emoji and the football emoji. \"Was a great laugh and enjoyed the experience,\" accompanied with the smiling face emoji.\n\nKeane's appearance - even holding a set of darts in one photo - comes a matter of months since he appeared to downplay the difficulty of the sport. During a conversation while working at Euro 2024 in Germany, Keane replied in typical fashion after Ian Wright labelled darts as \"magnificent\".\n\n\"It's all about practice. We could all become darts players if we practiced,\" Keane said.\n\nWright noted the 2023 World Championship final when Michael Smith and Michael van Gerwen as a memorable moment. \"It's magnificent is the darts,\" Wright said.\n\n\"It is a bit rowdy but to watch that... Like remember last year when they were both on for the nine darter! Watching that in the moment, it was watching perfection. Two guys at the very highest level, the peak of their performance, one of the most exciting things I've ever seen.\"\n\nAt the time, Neville, Scott and Wright then chose a nickname for Keane, who has been known for his downbeat and blunt nature. \"Roy 'the Killer' Keane,\" Neville suggested. \"Roy 'the Grumbler' Keane,\" Wright added.\n\nStory Saved\n\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\n\nFollow Manchester Evening News\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\n\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-shows-true-colours-30421479#comments-wrapper)\n\nMore On\n\n*   [Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\n*   [Darts](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darts)\n\n*   Sport\n*   all\n\n*   Most Read\n*   Most Recent\n\n[Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)[Leny Yoro call, Marcus Rashford change - Ruben Amorim could spring five Manchester United surprises](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/leny-yoro-call-marcus-rashford-30422218)[Manchester United team news as Ruben Amorim gets set for his first game in charge, against Ipswich Town on Sunday](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/leny-yoro-call-marcus-rashford-30422218)\n\n[1 Gary Neville and Roy Keane disagree on Marcus Rashford decision ahead of Ruben Amorim Man United call](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gary-neville-roy-keane-disagree-30419463?int_source=nba)[2 Angel Gomes Man United return boost as Ruben Amorim transfer stance revealed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/angel-gomes-man-united-return-30420258?int_source=nba][3 Dunelm launches 'biggest ever' Black Friday sale with up to 75% reduced on Ninja, duvet sets, lamps and heated blankets](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/dunelm-launches-biggest-ever-black-30404918?int_source=nba)[4 Debenhams reduces stylish £72 heater to £22 that's perfect for anyone without a fireplace](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/debenhams-reduces-stylish-72-heater-30400753?int_source=nba][5 I said yes when Manchester United tried to sign me but none of my 600 goals were scored for them](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/said-yes-manchester-united-tried-30415492?int_source=nba)",

      "article_text": "Antony's agent, Junior Pedroso, has said there is truth behind reports claiming Liverpool had interest in signing the Manchester United winger in 2022.\n\nIn a report issued by The Times on Tuesday, it was claimed Liverpool had interest in signing the Brazilian as they waited for Mohamed Salah to make a decision on his future.\n\nSalah signed a new contract at Anfield in July 2022, committing his future to the club until June 2025, meaning the Merseysiders' interest in Antony went no further.\n\nThe winger did seal an exit from Ajax later that summer, joining United in a deal worth more than £80million. He has struggled to live up to expectations at Old Trafford thus far, scoring 12 goals in 87 appearances.\n\nAmid recent speculation, Pedroso has now confirmed Liverpool were considering a move for Antony prior to Salah putting pen to paper on a new deal ahead of the 2022/23 season.\n\nSpeaking to winwin.com, Pedroso said: \"Yes, this story has a basis in truth. No, Salah renewed his contract at the time with Liverpool, and that made Antony's move to Liverpool impossible.\"\n\nAntony was hand-picked by former United manager Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2022 having previously worked with him at Ajax. United had strengthened their right-wing options the previous summer, signing Jadon Sancho, but he had failed to deliver the goods in his first season at Old Trafford.\n\nHowever, despite scoring on his United debut against Arsenal, Antony is in danger of going down as one of the Premier League's biggest ever flops. He has scored just five goals in 56 league games for the Reds.\n\nHe has featured in just two of their opening 11 league matches this season, with his only start across all competitions coming in the 7-0 win over Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round. He netted a first half penalty that evening.",

The youngster's great form has continued into this campaign and he recently scored a stunning free-kick.\n\nThwaites has contributed four goals and two assists in just three starts - he has made a total of nine appearances - for the U18s and has spent some time with the U16 group.\n\nThe midfielder predominantly played for the U16s last season, but he made nine appearances for the U18s and was given two substitute appearances for the Under-21s.\n\nHe was expected to be given a prominent role in Adam Lawrence's U18 side this season and he's gone from strength to strength, making an appearance in every U18 league game.\n\nDifferent sources have suggested Thwaites has slightly gone under the radar in the conversation about emerging prospects and the youngster has been tipped to have a bright future.\n\nThwaites was the second 16-year-old to be involved in Amorim's first training session, as imposing defender Godwill Kukonki also took part, which was a huge milestone in his career.\n\n**Academy players involved:** Jaydan Kamason, Jack Kingdon, Sam Murray, Finaley McAllister, Ruben Curley, Malachi Sharpe, Godwill Kukonki, Louis Jackson, Ethan Williams and Jim Thwaites.\n\n**Senior players involved:** Tom Heaton, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro, Amad, Antony, Marcus Rashford.",

      "headline": "Viktor Gyokeres to Man United transfer latest amid Ruben Amorim 'agreement' and Sporting dilemma",
      "article_text": "One of the names to be heavily linked is Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres. The 26-year-old is making waves across Europe with his goalscoring record.\n\nIn 18 domestic games across all competitions so far this season, he has scored 23 goals, including a hat trick in the Champions League win over Man City. The striker has also impressed on the international stage for Sweden, scoring nine goals in six Nations League appearances.\n\nAmorim’s move from sporting to United has led to speculation that he could be eyeing a reunion with his former striker. With that in mind, here is the latest on a potential move for Gyokeres, either in January or in the summer.\n\n#### ‘Gentleman’s agreement’\n\nAny potential move for Gyokeres in January could be put on hold, due to a reported ‘gentleman’s agreement’ between Amorim and former club Sporting CP. It is said that the manager has agreed not to approach any of Sporting’s players in the upcoming transfer window.\n\n[Journalist Fabrizio Romano claims](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-man-united-transfer-30418333) that as part of the negotiations that saw Amorim leave the club for United, the agreement was reached. That’s due to Sporting’s hopes of winning their respective title this season, although any summer move for players, including Gyokeres has not been ruled out.\n\n#### What the player has said\n\nGyokeres himself responded to rumours over his future earlier this week. He gave his thoughts on Amorim’s move to United, before commenting on the links.\n\n\"It’s very sad that he’s leaving, but of course we understand his decision,\" [he said](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-breaks-silence-man-30387160). \"He has of course meant a lot [to me] considering that he gave me that chance and that he made me develop so much.\"\n\nGyokeres then added: \"He [Amorim] probably has some strikers there already, so we’ll see. No, he hasn’t [contacted me]. It's fun but nothing I attach any importance to because it’s talk and nothing concrete.\"\n\n#### Sporting ‘need to sell’\n\nFormer Portuguese international Jose Fonte has provided hope to United over completing a deal, by highlighting the financial disparity between the two clubs. \"We need to sell. Portuguese clubs have to sell one or two players every season.\n\n\"We don't have the same TV rights as the Premier League so we don't have the capacity to hold on to players. It would be lovely to see Portugal with a little bit more capacity to hold on to their talent, of course.\"\n\n#### United monitoring the striker\n\nUnited Scouts were [reportedly in attendance](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-sent-scout-watch-30399381) to watch Gyokeres in Sweden’s 2-1 victory over Sloviakia at the weekend. The striker, of course, was on the scoresheet, finding the back of the net after just three minutes to give his side the lead.\n\nScouts would have also been impressed with his performance in Sweden’s next game. The striker scored four times in his nation’s 6-0 win over Azerbaijan on Tuesday night.",

      "article_text": "Sporting Lisbon and Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres is being heavily linked with a move to Man United.\nSporting Lisbon assistant boss Tiago Teixeira has insisted star striker Viktor Gyokeres is 'very happy' in the Portuguese capital amid reports linking him with a move to Manchester United.\nThe 26-year-old is currently the most sought after striker in Europe after making an explosive start to the season for club and country. His four-goal haul for Sweden against Azerbaijan in the UEFA Nations League on Tuesday night increased his tally of goals this season to 32.\nGyokeres joined Sporting from Coventry City in July 2023 and instantly blossomed under now-United head coach Ruben Amorim. He scored 66 goals in 68 matches under the 39-year-old's stewardship.\nEver since Amorim swapped Lisbon for Manchester earlier this month, reports connecting Gyokeres with a reunion with his former boss have soared. Many believe United would benefit from signing a striker of the Swede's profile. However, Teixeira, who is tasked with supporting Amorim's successor at Sporting, Joao Pereira, is adamant Gyokeres is not in any hurry to leave the Portuguese club.\nTeixeira, speaking to the Portuguese media, said: \"We are prepared to welcome him today to train for the first time [since being away on international duty] and we are very happy to have him here.\n\"He is also very happy with the season he is having representing Sporting and his national team. He is very happy to be here. What we want is to have him for as long as possible.\"\nGyokeres, who joined Sporting for a fee of around £20million, has already played down reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford. He said: \"These are rumours, nothing concrete. Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I enjoy my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\n\"He [Amorim] probably already has strikers there. It's very sad that he left [Sporting], but of course, we understand the decision. He meant a lot to me, as he gave me an opportunity and helped me evolve a lot.\"",

      "article_text": "Former Manchester United midfielder Angel Gomes could return to the club (Image: Eddie Keogh - The FA/The FA via Getty Images) The prospect of Angel Gomes returning to Manchester United is turning heads, especially with it now suggested which way Ruben Amorim leans on the subject.\n\nGomes was meant to be one of Old Trafford's stars of tomorrow. Raised in Salford, godson to Nani, all seemed to be falling into place when he broke into the first-team under Jose Mourinho but only 10 senior appearances afforded over the three years to follow left Man United on the back foot when the time came to renegotiate terms.\n\nHe would move for free to Ligue 1 outfit Lille, with whom he has 129 appearances for over the past four years. Recently rewarded with his first four England caps and again out of contract there come the current season's end, excitement over a possible homecoming has been growing based on recent rumours.\n\nMost crucially, The Sun have claimed that Gomes is a player who has been on Amorim's radar for a 'long time'. The boss is believed to feel the 24-year-old can return to Old Trafford for free next summer and become an integral part of his system. This aligns with the views of both sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox, so the midfielder very much remains a 'major target'.\n\nThey are well aware that once January arrives they can get to work on a pre-contract agreement, so seem primed and ready to move, this latest report suggests.\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that both Arsenal and Tottenham could provide competition.\n\nSpeaking in October, the man in question personally admitted 'it'd be difficult to say no' were Man United to make an approach to re-sign him. \"I do sometimes think about where I would be now [if I'd stayed at United],\" he discussed, though added: \"It's normal to feel like that, but the jump and trajectory that I took, the places that I've been, what I've learnt from the different coaches along the way, the detail, effort and love they have put into my game, I don't think I would be where I am now [a full England international] without it.\n\nOf course it cannot be ignored that at least until next July, Gomes is contracted to play for another club. However, the latest word from France suggests they have done little that would prevent Man United from reclaiming their former talent, if they desired to do so. According to L'Equipe, the Englishman seems to be 'edging closer' to the exit door as there have actually been no solid movements from Lille renew terms - not even before he is allowed to talk to potential foreign suitors from New Years' Day.\n\nAs amazing as it would be, after finding happiness abroad I know [playing in the Premier League] is not the be-all and end-all. There'll always be that sentimental soft spot, so of course it'd be difficult to say no. \n\n",

      "article_text": "Manchester United continue to be linked with Sporting CP defender Ousmane Diomande - especially so after Ruben Amorim was appointed as their head coach. Ruben Amorim has been readily linked with several Sporting CP players. (Image: Photo by Diogo Cardoso/Getty Images) Manchester United continue to be linked with defensive reinforcements ahead of the January transfer window - and one of Ruben Amorim's former players could be an ideal Jarrad Branthwaite alternative. The Manchester club invested heavily in the back-line over the summer with the additions of Leny Yoro from Lille, and both Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich. However, they were also heavily linked with Everton's Branthwaite and even had offers for the highly-rated England international rejected. Now, according to Sky Sports, Sporting CP's Ousmane Diomande has emerged as a transfer target for clubs in the Premier League - including Manchester City - but United might have the upper hand, given Amorim's recent arrival at Old Trafford. Diomande, 20, is an Ivory Coast international who moved to Europe in 2022 when he joined Danish outfit FC Midtjylland. He was then signed by Amorim and Sporting in January 2023 and has already made just shy of 70 appearances for the Portuguese club. Amorim promised he would not sign any of Sporting's players in the upcoming January transfer window, but next summer could be a whole different story, as interest in Diomande ramps up. The article goes on to state that the United head coach has already \"spoken\" with the defender in a bid to persuade him to choose the club over any of their Premier League rivals. Diomande now, reportedly, favours a reunion with his former manager as he knows it would be beneficial for his development. The defender signed a longer-term contract when he arrived almost two years ago with his current deal set to expire in the summer of 2027. It has previously been reported he has a £69million release clause in his contract with Sporting - while the likes of Arsenal have made attempts to sign him in the past. Amorim typically used Diomande centrally in his much-talked-about back three.",

      "article_text": "Jamie Carragher says what Ruben Amorim did in first week at Man United should excite supporters - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nCarragher has been impressed by one characteristic Amorim showed during his first few days as Manchester United head coach.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJamie Carragher says the confidence Ruben Amorim has shown in his own ability should breed confidence among Manchester United supporters.\n\nThe 39-year-old gave his first interview as the club’s new head boss last week, just days after arriving at Carrington. He underlined his eagerness to instil a sense of identity back into United and the importance of building momentum from the off.\n\nHe makes his debut at Ipswich Town on Sunday with United languishing in 13th. Amorim is expected to field his 3-4-3 formation that brought him two Portuguese titles at Sporting CP.\n\nWhile former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does “not think this squad is suited to three at the back”, he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way. \"I’ve been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,” he told The Overlap US.\n\n“He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?’\n\n“And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change’.\n\n“But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n“I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.”\n\nCarragher warned that Amorim faces heftier competition from lower-table teams in the Premier League than he did in Portugal. But he reckons that United will be put in good stead if Amorim is able to get his squad to buy in and then successfully implement his philosophy.\n\n“Let’s not forget, the Premier League has the best managers in the world and he’s coming up against some top operators, not even necessarily at the top end of the table,” Carragher added.\n\n“You look at people like Marco Silva or Thomas Frank, managers of teams in the middle of the table. They’re top managers.\n\n“I admired how confident [Amorim] was and this real belief he seems to have and if he can put that into Manchester United, because there’s still quality players there, and also make them believe in this system and how they go about it, I think he can do well.”",

(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\n\nRuben Amorim doesn’t have long to get his feet under the table at Manchester United before the chaos of a transfer window is upon us.\n\nThe new head coach started working with his players on the training pitch this week as preparations for the weekend’s clash against Ipswich start. The time in training will give Amorim a chance to assess his squad, with decisions to be made ahead of the transfer window that opens in less than two months.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, worries over Profitability and Sustainability rules (PSRs), as well as the club wanting to implement a more sustainable structure, means that the transfer budget in January is to be ‘modest.’\n\nHowever, one way of boosting the budget will be to sell players. With that in mind, here is a look at five players who United could cash in on in the winter window.\n\n1. **Harry Maguire** - The defender arrived for £80 million in the summer of 2019 but has found himself down the pecking order for the last couple of seasons. Maguire has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford over the last few transfer windows, and he will be entering the final six months of his contract when the January transfer window opens.\n\n2. **Victor Lindelof** - Lindelof is in a similar situation to Maguire and is also down the pecking order.\n\n3. **Christian Eriksen** - Another player who will have just six months remaining on his deal in January.\n\n4. **Marcus Rashford** - Rashford has struggled for form this season, and is one player who could bring in decent money.\n\n5. **Antony** - The winger has struggled to make an impact since his £82 million move from Ajax in the summer of 2022, and it is reported that United have already made the decision to cash in when the January window opens.\n\nThis winter window presents an opportunity for the club to capitalize on these players to fund new acquisitions for the team.",

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nPep Guardiola has won a total of 18 trophies with Manchester City. (Image: Getty)\n\nIn the club statement announcing the extension, Guardiola said: “Manchester City means so much to me.\n\n“This is my ninth season here; we have experienced so many amazing times together. I have a really special feeling for this football club.\n\n“That is why I am so happy to be staying for another two more seasons.\n\n“Thank you to everyone for continuing to trust and support me, it has always been an honour, a pleasure and a privilege to be here.\n\n“Hopefully now we can add more trophies to the ones we have already won. That will be my focus.”\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Sky Sports/ Manchester City",

Antony played as a right wing-back – a far from familiar role – while [Luke Shaw](https://www.sportbible.com/luke-shaw) was pushed inside as a left centre-back.\n\nAmorim wants his wing-backs to push high as he continues to push the much-favoured 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAnd with that in mind, transfer expert [**Fabrizio Romano**](https://x.com/fabrizioromano/status/1859508798802575382?s=46&t=uxXCWj4CwoDO3TqegCIzVA) has indicated that United want to sign a new left-back for Amorim’s system in 2025.\n\n\"The club is already assessing options with more than three candidates in list,\" he said on [**X**](https://x.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1859508798802575382), formerly Twitter. \"It only remains to be seen whether it’s gonna happen in January or summer window (most likely).\"\n\nRomano has already spoken about Amorim's plans ahead of his first game in charge.\n\n“Left back is a priority position,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"In 2025, Man Utd want to sign an important left-back. Amorim wants a top left-footed player in that position. Let me say clearly today that [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) are working on a new, important left-back or left-wing back. For sure United will do something there.”\n\nRomano went on to name Bournemouth\\\\s Milos Kerkez and [Bayern Munich](https://www.sportbible.com/bayern-munich)'s Alphonso Davies as two players on United's shortlist, but they will have competition from elsewhere, with Liverpool already showing an interest in Kerkez.\n\nRomano added: “They are monitoring Kerkez, even before Amorim. Liverpool are also monitoring him and Richard Hughes, [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) director, knows him so well from his time at Bournemouth. It’s not only Kerkez or Davies, there are also other names they are monitoring.\"\n\nImage credit: Getty\n\nThoughts on United's options at left wing-back?

The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut one big regret from his journey came before [Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) made his professional debut for Primeira Liga side Belenenses in 2003.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Portuguese newspaper [**Expresso**](https://tribuna.expresso.pt/), Amorim revealed that he still gets teased by his wife, Maria Joao Diogo, for leaving school before taking his exams at the age 18.\n\nIn short, Amorim regrets not having a better education after being unable to complete his school exams.\n\n“I had an agreement with my mother. I would continue at school until I signed a professional contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I signed when I was 17. Today, I regret it a lot. If I’d taken my exams, I could have done the 12th year. I could also have entered a top college. My wife is an electrotechnical engineer and she throws that in my face every day.”\n\nMaria, who tied the knot with Amorim at the Palacio de S.

They say it's the hope that kills you, but from the impression that I've had, speaking to his family and to his friends, even in his recent and quite short experience as a coach, they feel he is different and can offer a fresh look. It's hard to express, they said.\n\n\"He's going to provide Manchester United, hopefully, with a clean page and a new perspective.\"",

As the successor to his great idol Mo Salah. Things couldn’t get any better for him.”\n\nOmar Marmoush could be on his way to Liverpool (Credit:Getty)\n\nMarmoush started his career at Egypt-based side Wadi Degla before getting his first shot at European football with Wolfsburg in 2017, he showed signs of promise as a youngster but was loaned to several clubs, including St. Pauli and Stuttgart before penning a permanent deal with Eintracht in the summer of 2023.\n\nAt 25, his best days may well still be ahead of him, and with Salah still yet to sign a new deal at Anfield, his compatriot could be a perfect replacement come next season.\n\nMarmoush has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, according to [Sky Germany](https://sport.sky.de/fussball/artikel/fc-bayern-an-omar-marmoush-von-eintracht-frankfurt-interessiert/13248300/35313).\n\nThe player’s contract is set to run until June 2027, but when speaking with German Newspaper, [Welt](https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/eintracht-frankfurt/plus254530308/Eintracht-Frankfurt-Kroesche-im-Interview-Dann-lassen-wir-den-Spieler-auch-gehen.html), Frankfurt’s sporting director, Markus Krosche, pushed back when a journalist referred to the player’s value as €40m.\n\n“That \\[amount\\] won't be enough,” Krosche said.\n\n“It's often the case with many players who join us that we provide them with an environment where they can continue to develop—fully aware that we would let them go if they develop faster than the club itself.\n\n\"That's an agreement we make with the players.”",

He was removed from the squad after training under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nAmorim presided over his first training session at Carrington on Monday and centre back Yoro started on the right of United’s back three, with Jonny Evans in the middle and Luke Shaw on the left.\n\nYoro is expected to have a key role in Amorim’s new set-up as United transition to a 3-4-3 formation and the 19-year-old could make his debut away at Ipswich Town on Sunday.\n\nThe former Lille defender was United’s costliest summer signing in a deal rising to £58.91million but Yoro fractured the metatarsal bone in his left foot during his second start in the pre-season friendly with Arsenal in Los Angeles on July 26.\n\nUnited could be without centre halves Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez at Portman Road. Maguire has been sidelined for seven weeks with a calf injury he sustained in the first half of the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6 and he was not involved in the team training session filmed on Monday.\n\nMartinez withdrew from the Argentina squad with a back injury, having received medical treatment from United physio Jordan Reece during their last fixture against Leicester City.\n\nUnited full back Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for the club since May 2023 for the Under 21s in their EFL Trophy defeat at Huddersfield Town last week. Malacia has been participating in team training for upwards of a month now.\n\nShaw, who last played for United on February 18, is back in full training and has excelled at centre half in a duo and a trio.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United make Sekou Kone plan after midfielder's injury scare - Manchester Evening News\n===============\n\nMan United signed Malian Sekou Kone in the summer and the midfielder has an exciting future at Old Trafford.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSekou Kone's injury is not serious and he could return to a pitch in a matter of weeks for Manchester United.\n\nKone made his first start for the academy in the Under-21s' game against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Trophy last week but limped off the pitch with an injury after 40 minutes. The 18-year-old was hurt after a strong Huddersfield challenge and was subsequently pictured leaving the stadium using crutches and wearing a protective boot on his right foot.\n\nThat prompted fears among fans that Kone might have sustained a serious problem, but his injury is not thought to be a major issue and he is expected to return in a matter of weeks, not months, although the club will continue to handle him carefully as he settles in Manchester.\n\nSources have reiterated patience will be key with Kone. The youngster demonstrated his quality against Huddersfield but there were also clear signs of greenness in his performance.\n\nUnited will give the 18-year-old time to adapt to his new surroundings and won't rush him. Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million in the summer and the intensity and demands of elite football in England are completely different to what he's been accustomed to in his career.\n\nKone's dynamic range of passing was on show against Huddersfield but his influence was reduced as the half progressed, with the youngster struggling physically against senior players. United have given Kone the opportunity to train with the first-team at Carrington but he has spent the majority of his time around the U21 group and needs to physically develop.\n\nKone was first scouted by United in November at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched him throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish, and they identified a player of significant interest to follow.\n\nAnother United scout then attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April where Kone was one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",

He underlined his eagerness to instil a sense of identity back into United and the importance of building momentum from the off.\n\nHe makes his debut at Ipswich Town on Sunday with United languishing in 13th. Amorim is expected to field his 3-4-3 formation that brought him two Portuguese titles at Sporting CP.\n\nWhile former Liverpool star Jamie Carragher does “not think this squad is suited to three at the back”, he believes Amorim’s self-assurance will go a long way. \"I’ve been really impressed with what the manager has said so far,” he told The Overlap US.\n\n“He certainly has charisma, a personality, he’s laughing and joking with questions. He got asked the question, ‘If I’m a Manchester United fan, what can I see on day one?’\n\n“And more often than not a manager would bat that question away and say, ‘Oh, hang on, I’ve only had two training sessions, we’ve got a long way to go, there’s a lot to change’.\n\n“But he’s just said straightaway, ‘I can guarantee you that you will see a plan, you’ll see an idea in the first two or three games'.\n\n“I’m not a Manchester United fan, obviously, but if I’m a Manchester United fan that would fill me with confidence that he was so confident in his abilities, his system.”\n\nCarragher warned that Amorim faces heftier competition from lower-table teams in the Premier League than he did in Portugal. But he reckons that United will be put in good stead if Amorim is able to get his squad to buy in and then successfully implement his philosophy.\n\n“Let’s not forget, the Premier League has the best managers in the world and he’s coming up against some top operators, not even necessarily at the top end of the table,” Carragher added.\n\n“You look at people like Marco Silva or Thomas Frank, managers of teams in the middle of the table. They’re top managers.\n\n“I admired how confident [Amorim] was and this real belief he seems to have and if he can put that into Manchester United, because there’s still quality players there, and also make them believe in this system and how they go about it, I think he can do well.”",

I know, I feel it. I will wait. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it.\n\n\"But absolutely I will not consider my future (if) it depends being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"\n\nTherefore, while City fans will undoubtedly be happy by the news that the six-time Premier League winner was staying at the club, it does not provide any further insight into the potential result of the ongoing hearing into the FFP charges.\n\nPep Guardiola has won a total of 18 trophies with Manchester City.

There is a clear identity, whether winning 5-0 or losing 5-0.”\n\nPedro Porro was a regular starter under Amorim at Sporting.

The answer is he should be,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether Ennis is given an opportunity to play for the first-team remains to be seen, but he can't do much more in academy games and seems guaranteed to enjoy a fulfilling career. He produced a goal in the final seconds for his hat-trick and is a youngster worth closely watching.\"\n\nEnnis, who penned a new contract in the summer, will spend the first half of the season with United's under-21s before his situation is assessed in January. He could\n\nBack in August, the [**MEN**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-make-decision-former-29779633) reported: \"He will continue to be an integral U21 player and could be allowed to leave on a temporary deal to challenge himself in a senior environment in the January window.",

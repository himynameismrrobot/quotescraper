According to reports in Denmark, Obi-Martin is set to be rewarded for his impressive start to life at United by signing a first professional contract with the club when he turns 17 on Friday (November 29).\n\nObi-Martin penned scholarship terms with United upon signing for the club, with rules in England prohibiting players from signing professional contracts before they turn 17. Prior to signing for United, Obi-Martin was the subject of big praise from Denmark U17s boss Jesper Mikkelsen, who said: \"When you look at Chido, he doesn't look like someone who hasn't turned 16 yet.\n\nAfter signing his first deal with United in September, Obi-Martin said: \"Very happy to sign with this amazing club, time to focus and achieve all my dreams. Thanks to everyone who has helped me get this far.\"\n\nUnited are currently top of the U18s Premier League North with nine wins from as many games.",

In fact, ahead of their last-16 clash in 2006, an 18-year-old [Messi](https://www.sportbible.com/lionel-messi) was vocal about Chelsea.\n\n\"There are \\[Barcelona\\] players here who hate Chelsea more than [Real Madrid](https://www.sportbible.com/real-madrid),\" he said.\n\n\"I never thought I would hear myself say that. I also never thought I would see something worse than the Boca and River Plate rivalry or Brazil vs Argentina - but this is.\n\n\"We would rather play Arsenal, [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"\n\nMessi would go on to produce a superb display for the Catalan side, despite being hacked down by Chelsea defender Asier Del Horno, who was sent off for a shocking challenge on the Argentine.\n\nAn own goal from John Terry and a late strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a first leg advantage before they knocked Jose Mourinho's side out following a 1-1 draw at the Camp Nou.\n\nBarca would lift the [Champions League](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league) that year after Juliano Belletti scored a late winner at the Stade de France against Arsenal.\n\nMessi later recalled a 2012 Champions League defeat to Chelsea as being one of his biggest regrets in a Barcelona shirt.\n\n“I would have liked to have tried to win another Champions League,\" he said in 2021, when he announced his decision to leave Barca.\n\n“We got knocked out in the semi-final's by Liverpool which stopped us getting to another final. We got to the semi-final with Chelsea with Pep \\[Guardiola\\], they prevented us from getting to another final.",

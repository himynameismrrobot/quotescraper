      "headline": "09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules, published at 09:33Premier League clubs approve changes to APT rules",
      "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to integrating the assessment of shareholder loans and include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City. Today's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nHowever, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiralling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSimon Stone,\nChief football news reporter,\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote.\n\nLast week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules.\n\nThey feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nClarification from the tribunal is still to be received, but City feel its recommendations will end up siding with them, which will effectively make today's vote irrelevant.",

      "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players.\n\nNo pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period.\n\nIt's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence.\n\nHow about that!\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nWhat a week!\n\nOnly two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again.\n\nThat led to a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m\n\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, £6m\n\nAll home to Nottingham Forest\n\nYes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week.\n\nThis is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend.\n\nMikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four.\n\nForest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games.\n\nThey've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces.\n\nI'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal.\n\nLewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham\n\nThe new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price.\n\nHe is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43.\n\nUp-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him.\n\nMidfield\n\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton\n\nThe way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer.\n\nHe has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block.\n\nSalah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich\n\nWith the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics.\n\nGameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts.\n\nDwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford\n\nMcNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season.\n\nThree goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played.\n\nEverton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week.\n\nLike McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game.\n\nHe's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games.\n\nForwards\n\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham\n\nThe Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions.\n\nThe way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals.\n\nWith just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that!\n\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nThere's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less.\n\nOne of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals.\n\nJoao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth\n\nThe Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season.\n\nAs long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025.\n\nSubs' bench\n\nBernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves\n\nThere's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet.\n\nAntoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton\n\nThe shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul!\n\nSemenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL.\n\nLucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace\n\nI could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him.\n\nIbrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton\n\nKonate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nTotal team cost = £98.5m\n\nTeam to target\n\nBrighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a)\n\nIf you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time.\n\nTheir run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting.\n\nLots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

      "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\nNeil Johnston\n\nBBC Sport journalist in Lisbon\n\n*   Published\n    \n    2 November 2024\n    \n\nUpdated 21 November 2024\n\n**\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.**\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\n\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.'\n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\n\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\n\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\n\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.\"",

      "article_text": "Manchester United released a seven-minute video on Monday to mark Ruben Amorim's first training session as the club's head coach.\n\nPlayers including Casemiro and Marcus Rashford put out positive posts on their social media accounts to state how well it had gone.\n\nThe editing of a session that would normally last more than an hour gave a few small clues about Amorim's thinking before his first match in charge at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nThere was also a bit of fitness news - and a definite subtle message to try to suggest issues from Erik ten Hag's tenure are now being addressed.\n\nEngland duo Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo, and new signing Leny Yoro, were all involved as they step up their recovery from recent injuries.\n\nHarry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof were not shown playing any part. All missed international duty this month through injury.\n\nAndre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were all absent on international duty.\n\nMuch of the debate around Amorim's appointment has centred around his tactics and how he preferred to operate with three central defenders and two wing-backs at Sporting, an alien concept at United going back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\n\nAmorim said in his interview with club media on Friday fans would see \"an idea\" at Portman Road this weekend. Judging by this footage, a back three will be part of that.\n\nJonny Evans was flanked by Yoro to his right and Shaw to the left. Antony was the right wing-back, Tyrell Malacia the left wing-back.\n\nCasemiro and Mainoo filled the deeper midfield slots, with Mason Mount - who applied a first-time finish to an Antony cross - Amad Diallo and Rashford in the forward roles.\n\nOne of the major criticisms of recent United incarnations, going back long before Ten Hag's time, is a lack of work-rate, particularly when it comes to tracking back.\n\nUnited are not saying who signed off the video edit but it seems fairly clear some thought has gone into what was released.\n\nIn possession and attacking, four times, players were shown chasing back hard after Amorim had given the signal for a lost ball and a counter-attack.\n\nIt was repeated so often in such a short space of time, it was as though someone at Old Trafford wanted it to be known Amorim is trying to address United's issues in transition.\n\nIn the summer, Mainoo was one of three players - Hojlund and Garnacho being the others - who were ring-fenced as United made it clear they were willing to listen to offers for virtually all their first-team squad.\n\nAs a local boy and academy graduate, Mainoo, 19, is the pin-up boy for how the club wants to be represented.\n\nSo, while it is safe to assume Amorim singled out more than one player for a spot of impromptu coaching, the discussion with Mainoo was the one that made it into the public domain.\n\nAmorim showed Mainoo what he wanted from him in terms of body shape and positioning - and what different options he could have by moving just a short distance.\n\nIt is worth remembering Amorim has been appointed as head coach, not a manager, as Ten Hag had been.\n\nIt is Amorim who is guiding players through the patterns he wants to establish.\n\nThere were smiles alongside the messages in the edit of Amorim on Monday.\n\nThe nearest we saw to ferocity was his demand to \"not lose the ball\" seconds before intervening to tell Evans they had lost possession and needed to regain their position.\n\nIt was insightful to a point. But it was also the picture United wanted the world to see.",

He said it is a big club, with lovely people. It still is. That is correct.”\n\n**Amorim: I am the right guy in the right moment**\n\n'Call me naive. But I truly believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the world still will turn, the sun will rise again, I don’t worry about that. I truly believe I’m the right guy for this job.'\n\n**Amorim: This is not a revolution**\n\n\"It is not revolution because football is not so different with five players at the back or four or three.\n\n\"We have our own ideas. We have our way we see football and we will change the way we play.\"\n\n**Amorim: We need to improve a lot to win titles**\n\n\"We have space to grow as a team and we need to improve in a lot of areas. We are changing in the middle of the season with a different way of playing. We need to improve the physical aspect of the team.\n\nI don't know how long it will take but I know we need to win games at Manchester United. I will not tell you we need a lot of time but we need to improve a lot to win titles.\"\n\n**Amorim feels United are aligned with his views**\n\n\"I am a dreamer and I believe in myself. I believe in the club and we have the same idea and same mindset.\n\n\"I think we have room to improve and I want to try new things.\"\n\n**Amorim: I feel at home**\n\n\"It's bigger. There's a lot of departments which is different to Sporting. It is a global club with so much to do, not just coaching the team. I have a lot of help and I am very happy and very comfortable. I feel at home.\"\n\n**Ruben Amorim on his style**\n\n“If you want to speak about the way we play, we lose the ball too often, so we need to keep the ball better. We need to be better running back and I think that’s clear for everybody [smiles]. We have to be clear in the small details.\"",

      "article_text": "Manchester United figures are already having doubts over major summer signing.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee scored on his Man United debut and that remains his only goal after 17 appearances for the club.\n\nManchester United are having serious doubts about summer signing Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nSome senior club figures have concluded striker Zirkzee, who has scored one goal in 17 games, is not good enough four months on from his £36.5million transfer from Bologna.\n\nZirkzee, 23, was not even named on the bench for the Netherlands in their Nations League win over Georgia last week as United flop Wout Weghorst started up front. Zirkzee started as the No.10 in the Netherlands’ 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday night but was replaced by Weghorst in the 77th minute.\n\nUnited have been in dire goalscoring form this season and have managed a meagre 12 goals in 12 Premier League games. They have a 0 goal difference following the 3-0 defeat of Leicester City.\n\nZirkzee has not scored since his debut against Fulham more than three months ago while Rasmus Hojlund has scraped two goals in 12 games. Hojlund has also failed to score in his past 12 matches for Denmark. Club sources concede scrutiny of a striker summer signing is inevitable when they are enduring a drought.\n\nUnited are expected to be in the market for a dependable goalscorer next year, which would almost certainly require the sale or loan of one of their incumbent forwards. Hojlund has tallied 18 goals in 55 games for United, having netted 27 from 87 matches for previous clubs Atalanta, Sturm Graz and Copenhagen. Zirkzee got 36 goals in 126 games for Bayern Munich, Parma, Anderlecht and Bologna.\n\nHojlund commanded an up-front fee of £64m rising to £72m in July 2023 after United refused to deal with Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy amid then-manager Erik Ten Hag’s desire to sign Harry Kane, who had entered the final year of his contract. The failure to recruit a proven goalscorer contributed to United ending the 2023-24 Premier League season in eighth and with a -1 goal difference.\n\nZirkzee has lined up in two of United’s past nine matches - against Fenerbahce in the Europa League and Leicester in the League Cup. His last league start was in the 3-0 home humbling by Tottenham on September 29.\n\nFormer United caretaker manager Ruud van Nistelrooy said earlier this month the squad lacked a consistent goalscorer. \"Yeah, I agree that when you want to be a successful side in the Premier League and in Europe - and that is what the build is all about - you're going to need a certain amount of goals.\"\n\nAlejandro Garnacho is United’s top scorer this term with seven goals, followed by Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford on four. Rashford is without a goal in eight games and appeared to play as the striker in new head coach Ruben Amorim’s maiden team training session on Monday as United prepare to switch to a 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAmorim’s preference is for the striker to stay high, which jars with Zirkzee’s tendency to drop deep. Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres plundered 23 goals in 16 games for Sporting under Amorim this season and has a £63m release clause in the summer.",

      "headline": "'He doesn't give a s**t' - why Ruben Amorim sources believe he will succeed at Manchester United",
      "article_text": "Optimism has returned to the Manchester United before a ball has been kicked under new head coach Ruben Amorim.\n\nWhat does someone who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting make of him? “His drive to succeed is incredible,” they said. “He’s ruthless. He doesn’t give a s**t what people say or who players are.”\n\nThat will be music to Manchester United supporters’ ears. The illuminating footage of Amorim in the thick of it during his first team training session at Carrington has further fuelled excitement.\n\nTraining sessions are sensitive and United highlighted that behind the erection of a wall earlier this season that shielded the first team’s pitch. On Monday evening, seven minutes of Amorim timing attacks from back to front was aired.\n\nIt confirmed Amorim is indoctrinating the players in the ways of his much-hyped 3-4-3, with potential early indicators as to who will start at Ipswich Town on Sunday. There was also the rare sight of United players sprinting towards their own goal.\n\nLeny Yoro was informed on Monday he was down to start for the Under 21s in the National League Cup at Altrincham on Tuesday evening. His absence was owed to Amorim. Yoro was in the United defensive triumvirate for Amorim’s maiden session.\n\nOf all the post-Ferguson managerial appointments, only Jose Mourinho’s in 2016 rivals the buzz around his compatriot. At the time of Erik ten Hag’s overdue dismissal, it seemed unlikely United would settle on a replacement to completely unify the fanbase yet they have achieved that with Amorim.\n\nIt helped that the 39-year-old was visible in the days before United confirmed his imminent arrival, affably indulging the handful of English media representatives at his press conferences in Lisbon. More flocked to his briefings the following week as Sporting gave Manchester City a shellacking in the Champions League. United’s best result in Europe that week was not against PAOK.\n\nThe personable Amorim pressed the flesh during his tour of Old Trafford last Thursday and a handful of fortunate visitors’ own tour coincided with his. Optimism at United has not been this rife or widespread since the FA Cup final, an anomalous high among innumerable lows.\n\nIt makes it all the more peculiar that Amorim will not be introduced at Old Trafford today. He sat at the same press conference seat last week that Ten Hag did a day after the sulphurous 2021-22 campaign ended.\n\nSince David Moyes, every permanent or interim United manager has been afforded an introductory press conference at Old Trafford. In the Zoom era, Ralf Rangnick was deemed worthy of a first in-person press conference in 21 months. The Number 7 suite was opened for Mourinho, Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nA paint-by-numbers interview by in-house media with Amorim, conducted last Thursday evening, was published around 24 hours later at 7pm on Friday, a graveyard slot in the daily news cycle. United gave the impression they were burying bad news when Amorim’s arrival is only behind the FA Cup victories over Liverpool and City for their feel-good story of the calendar year.\n\nClub sources say Amorim was deliberately held back to allow him to settle into his new routine, rather than subject him to two press conferences before his first match in charge. He will hold court at Carrington at 1.30pm on Friday.\n\nThere will be up to three sections for regulars, the Sunday newspaper journalists and guests from Portugal. The upper floor of the Jimmy Murphy Centre is not vast and the event has already been billed as a probable circus by a staff member.\n\nThe key questions will eventually be asked and answered at the bum-fight this afternoon. Pre-match press conferences usually last 15 minutes. An audience with Amorim will warrant at least double that.\n\nSome at United are reluctant to be overly positive. They have seen this all before with a new manager, as those who cover them have, too. Figures at the club have welcomed Amorim's energy and his presence has been uplifting. \"He has struck all the right notes,\" one source said.\n\n\"He's more charismatic and empathetic with players and the press than Ten Hag,\" someone else who knows Amorim said. \"He will answer everything at a press conference. He tends to joke.\"\n\nAmorim worked closely with the Sporting president Frederico Varandas and sporting director Hugo Vian. His confidants believe a similar rapport is required with the United hierarchy. Amorim has spoken about his \"connection\" with chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nPortuguese sources feel Amorim will make tweaks to his anticipated 3-4-3 system. The majority of United's centre backs are well versed in the back three set-up while Diogo Dalot operated in a 3-4-3 for Porto B when United scouted him.\n\nAmorim came \"very close\" to succeeding Jurgen Klopp when Liverpool whittled down their shortlist of candidates to Amorim and Arne Slot. Manchester City earmarked Amorim as Pep Guardiola's heir had he left Manchester after ten years. He will encounter Guardiola again in next month's derby.\n\nLike Mourinho, Amorim is holed up in The Lowry Hotel, though his residency is unlikely to rival his mentor's as he is already house-hunting. United security staff have ferried Amorim to Carrington every day this week.\n\nThere is a curious sub-plot to Amorim's United debut at Portman Road. In the opposite dugout, there will be another highly-regarded 30-something coach who was a candidate to replace Ten Hag this year. Kieran McKenna is also another Mourinho protégé, having been promoted to first team coach at United in July 2018 three months after Amorim’s internship at Carrington.\n\nHad United come calling for McKenna a second time last month then his release clause would have been more expensive than Amorim’s prudent €10 million buyout. Some of the more entitled United players found McKenna’s methods to be too officious whereas the younger squad members were more receptive.\n\nOne narrative can be scrapped from this weekend’s fixture. The last time United were at Portman Road in May 2002 the game was settled by Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nVan Nistelrooy gained “closure” with his appreciation for the United supporters at full-time against Leicester two weeks ago. Then Amorim closed the door. There was that ruthlessness, hours after Amorim's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport.\n\nThere was something else Amorim’s former colleague at Sporting mentioned: “He will 100% succeed.”",

      "article_text": "Manchester United player ratings this season so far as six get 7/10 and one gets a 2 - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United have had their worst-ever start to a Premier League season but some individuals have still performed respectably.\n\nA third of the way into the season and Manchester United are still in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nUnited have lost five of their 11 league fixtures but Ruud van Nistelrooy's uplifting four-match stint as caretaker manager has ensured new head coach Ruben Amorim will inherit a more buoyant squad.\n\nDespite United's 13th-place status, they have a League Cup quarter-final next month, have four games to secure automatic qualification for the Europa League round-of-16 and will start their defence of the FA Cup in January.\n\nAmad, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro regained form under Van Nistelrooy while Alejandro Garnacho tallied two more goals under the Dutchman. Here are how the United players have rated this season so far:\n\n**Andre Onana**\nOne of a handful of performers who has had a respectable season. Made some world-class saves (Crystal Palace and Fenerbahce) and important stops (Southampton and Porto). 7\n\n**Diogo Dalot**\nAfter a reasonable 2023-24, Dalot is in a rut. He has played often enough at left back to do better there yet he is underperforming on both sides. Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\nThe best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\nHad some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\nSeldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans**\nTen appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire**\nMissed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof**\nBelatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\nWeary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro**\nThe first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte**\nLeicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen**\nAlready started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes**\nFootball’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad**\nA decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\nUnited’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford**\nWhen he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\nNetted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._",

      "article_text": "For Manchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim, today is likely to be the day when the extent of the challenge that lies ahead of him becomes real.\n\nThe Portuguese will face the media for the very first time as United boss ahead of this Sunday's clash with Ipswich Town in the Premier League. Since becoming the new boss, Amorim's media duties have remained either in-house or in front of the Portuguese journalists while still Sporting manager.\n\nHowever, today marks his first press conference in the United Kingdom as the Reds' boss and we can expect the new manager to touch on plenty of topics. As well as previewing his Premier League debut; transfers, future goals and his assessment of the current squad are likely to all be on the agenda too.\n\nWhile Amorim talking to the media is the big talking point of the day, there are other areas to focus on too. The January transfer window is just around the corner and speculation about potential signings is beginning to hot up.\n\nViktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with the Reds however a deal for the Swede is more likely to be completed in the summer than this winter.\n\nReal Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.\n\nOne of the clubs interested in his signature is Real, with reports stating the Spanish giants are 'favourites' and are 'confident' on securing his services from next summer onwards. Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, is expected to lose one of the two at the end of the season, though it's said it cannot be ruled out that both end up moving on.\n\nSpeaking to the media, former Premier League midfielder Emmanuel Petit believes that Amorim has that added ingredient which Ten Hag lacked at Old Trafford. Petit noted Amorim will stick with his philosophy, his tactics, and his style at United, in contrast to Ten Hag's frequent changes.\n\nAmorim's first media duties in this country are scheduled to begin at 2pm. Man United will be showing live coverage of the press conference on their in-house television channel, MUTV.\n\nIn an interview for TribalFootball.com, ex-United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes Amorim will need at least 18 months to implement his style at Old Trafford. He expressed that Amorim has plenty of charisma and tactical acumen necessary to create a strong identity at Manchester United.\n\nFormer City striker Sergio Aguero believes Amorim's new squad will rally to help him overcome challenges he experiences at Old Trafford. Aguero noted that Amorim is arriving with a very good record and faces the challenge of infusing United with the identity that its supporters have grown accustomed to.\n\nUnited are having serious doubts about summer signing Joshua Zirkzee, who has scored one goal in 17 games. Senior club figures have concluded that Zirkzee, who was not even named on the bench for the Netherlands in their recent match, might not be good enough after only a few months at Old Trafford.\n\nOverall, today marks a significant moment for Amorim and United as they navigate through the challenges ahead.",

      "article_text": "Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada has shown his feelings over Manchester City during the Premier League's Associated Party Transactions (APT) vote on Friday.\n\nThe voting comes after Man City claimed victory from an independent panel in October which concluded that the rules introduced since Newcastle United's takeover were unlawful. As a result, league officials had drawn up a new proposal and a new vote took place on Friday morning - which deemed City defeated in their attempt to stop new rules on APT being voted through.\n\nHowever, the reigning champions had warned all top-flight clubs that new rules should not be put in place before the expert opinions from the arbitration hearing had been fully considered. Aston Villa were one of the clubs who also favoured that view, but in the meeting a majority backed the Premier League's proposal.\n\nAs reported by the Press Association, City were represented by their CFO Ingo Bank at the meeting but it is claimed he didn't speak. Meanwhile, City's former football operations officer Berrada spoke in support of the amendments along with Chelsea's general counsel James Bonington.\n\nBerrada was appointed as Manchester United CEO in January but only joined in the summer upon completion of a period of gardening leave after resigning from his role at City Football Group after 11 years. His decision to speak against City in the meeting shows he has already dived fully into his new role at United.\n\nA statement by the Premier League read: \"At a Premier League Shareholders’ meeting today, clubs approved changes to the League’s Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules. The amendments to the rules address the findings of an arbitration tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year.\n\n\"The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system. This relates to integrating the assessment of shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with associated parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the league.\"",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim already has what Erik ten Hag didn't at Man United after private chat",
      "article_text": "Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag at the end of last month after a historically bad start to the Premier League season. His second season was a lot more difficult though, as United crashed out of the group stages in the Champions League and looked set not to qualify for Europe at all until they won the FA Cup. The victory over Manchester City at Wembley gave Ineos reason to extend Ten Hag's contract. \n\nHowever, he lasted little more than two months in charge before being sacked at the end of October. This weekend sees a new era begin at United with Ruben Amorim leading the club for the very first time at Ipswich Town. Ahead of the fixture, Carragher has penned his thoughts on the previous regime. In the piece, he opened up on a private conversation he had with Neville that was less than flattering for Ten Hag.\n\n\"The most successful managers have an aura and personality,\" he wrote. \"Only those working in the same environment can offer a first-hand account of how the manager operates behind the scenes, but for those of us on the outside looking in, perceptions matter. Without dwelling too much on United's recent past, this was a red flag against Ten Hag from day one. Two games into his reign, Gary Neville and I had the pleasure of interviewing Ten Hag at United's training ground.\n\n\"He was a polite guy but there was no sense of an x-factor. Driving away from the meeting that day, I turned to Gary and said: 'He must be a supercoach because there isn’t much charisma.' The same could hardly be said for Amorim, if early impressions are anything to go by. \"A Manchester United manager must carry the same gravitas, and although he has only given one media interview to his club’s website since being appointed, if I was a supporter I would already believe Amorim’s character will be vastly different from his predecessor,\" added Carragher.",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim's Carrington reaction could offer Manchester United's forgotten man a new start",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim will pick his first Man Utd team on Sunday and while the fixture at Ipswich might come too soon for Mason Mount, he will get a chance to impress the new boss.\n\nIt is unusual for Manchester United to release such in-depth footage of training as they did on Monday, showing plenty of action from Ruben Amorim's first day on the grass at Carrington.\n\nThe seven-minute clip showed Amorim arranging the players available to him in his favoured 3-4-3 shape, and it's been pored over relentlessly since to decipher any clues as to what he may or may not do.\n\nIt was clear that the 39-year-old was at the heart of the action at Carrington, taking on a hands-on role in a high-intensity session. There was also praise for one player who could be well-suited to Amorim's demands but has hardly a mention in the chat about the players or might or might not win favour with the former Sporting boss.\n\nIn one clip, Mason Mount latches on to a Tyrell Malacia pass, and you can hear Amorim shout, \"Good movement, Mase\" across the pitch. In the following clip it is Mount himself scoring from another attack. After each one ends in a goal, Amorim is seen looking at his watch and demanding his players get going again.\n\nHe wants his team to play with an intensity and aggression that wasn't always evident at United under Erik ten Hag. Mount can deliver these characteristics, however, and he was impressive at the very start of this season, pressing on the front foot and showing an energy that really added something to the team's play.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a familiar story when Mount picked up an injury at Brighton. After a brief comeback in September, he returned to the treatment table before coming on against PAOK earlier in November.\n\nThe 25-year-old is now back fit and back in full training and already impressing Amorim. It remains to be seen whether Mount has done enough to start for the first time in three months when United face Ipswich this weekend, but at the very least, he will be an option off the bench.\n\nMount must make up for lost time in his Old Trafford career. He was signed for £55m in the summer of 2023, with a further £5m in add-ons, and was earmarked to be the connector in Erik ten Hag's midfield three. He didn't stay fit enough for long enough to make that spot his own, and Kobbie Mainoo's emergence dropped Mount down the pecking order.\n\nThere is a feeling that the former Chelsea midfielder is better closer to goal, and under Amorim, he might find it hard to challenge for either of the two deeper midfield slots, which could be a battle between Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, but the Portuguese coach does often pick two No. 10s, and that could well be Mount's best position.\n\nIn Ten Hag's 4-3-3, Mount had no chance of displacing Bruno Fernandes, but now there could be room for both of them to play a central, creative role behind a striker. That's an opportunity Mount can't afford to waste.\n\nHe will face competition for that role, probably from the cast of wingers who might look to operate there now, such as Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Amad. It will be fascinating to see how Amorim fits enough attacking talent onto the pitch to make a difference.\n\nBut you can see why he would like someone like Mount. At his best, he is a coach's dream, and there is a reason so many coaches have loved working with him. One of them was Thomas Tuchel, soon to take over as England head coach. With a fresh start on offer at club level as well, it's a big few months ahead for Mount.",

Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony.\n\nQuickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to.

I will be here.\n\n\"Next year, if we are in the Conference we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now.\n\n\"I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, 'It's the last year of Pep'. I don't want to be in that position.\"\n\nHowever, the five-time Premier League winner admitted that if results for City turned for the worst, then he would consider leaving the club and pursuing a career elsewhere.\n\n\"I would like to stay for the two years but I know if the results are not good it will not be two years,\" added Guardiola.\n\nSo far in the 2024/25 Premier League season, City have struggled to match the standard set by themselves in previous seasons, as they continue to miss midfield star Rodri who suffered a season-ending injury in September.",

      "headline": "Man Utd have bizarre 'war' clause written into Carrington training ground deal that fans won't believe",
      "article_text": "Manchester United’s Carrington Training Centre has played host to some of the best footballers of all time – but it would be turned into something entirely different if a war was to happen.\n\nCarrington replaced United’s ‘The Cliff’ training ground in the year 2000.\n\nSince opening its doors, the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney have used its facilities – whether that be the carpet-like training pitches, gym facilities or boot rooms.\n\nAlthough Ronaldo may not entirely approve of the facilities, which he made clear in his 2022 interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, the training ground is one of the most iconic in the Premier League.\n\nFormer United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, 82, previously revealed that there was a bizarre clause written into the contract to buy the land. This included ‘untouched’ areas for Canada Geese as well as an odd scenario involving a potato farm.\n\n\"The Cliff was great when I first came, but then the club grew,” he told the UTD Podcast in September 2021.\n\n\"We had to put an extension in the indoor place for the boys to dress because we had no space in the actual building. \"So, then I started to wander around Manchester looking for a piece of ground that we could build a new training ground on.\n\n\"We’re hunting everywhere, in North Manchester in particular.”\n\nThe Scot then explained how former chief scout and academy director Les Kershaw approached him with a friend from Shell. \"He said ‘Shell are trying to sell some of their ground over at Carrington’,... so we went to see.\n\n\"The size of the land we were getting, I think it was 28 acres or something, but there were restrictions which I can’t understand today.\"\n\n\"Part of the restrictions were, in the event of war, we had to turn the ground into potato fields,” Ferguson explained.\n\n\"And, up at the very end, there had to be an acre or two acres for Canadian geese.”\n\nThe 13-time Premier League-winning manager then revealed how he returned to Old Trafford during Louis van Gaal’s tenure as manager only to find that the Dutchman had put stands and floodlights up around the venue.",

      "headline": "Arsenal fans are all saying same thing after hearing what Kai Havertz said in training-ground video",
      "article_text": "Eagle-eyed Arsenal fans spotted exactly what Kai Havertz said in a Gunners training ground video this week – and it speaks volumes.\n\nHavertz, 25, has led Arsenal’s attacking line for much of the season, having already chipped in with four goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances this term.\n\nThe former Chelsea man was called up to Germany’s squad for the November Nations League fixtures and got on the scoresheet during a 7-0 drubbing of Bosnia and Herzegovina on Saturday, 16 November.\n\nNow, his attention will have turned back to club side Arsenal, who take on Nottingham Forest in the Premier League tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHavertz is likely to be among the starting line-up at the Emirates, but he admitted that he would like to have an attribute that one of his Gunners teammates possesses.\n\nThis week, the German was asked, “What is the one quality of your teammates you'd like to have?\" when appearing to enter the team’s Sobha Realty Training Centre.\n\nSeveral players, including Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino, gave their thoughts highlighting “Gabriel Martinelli’s pace”, “wanting to be able to header like Gabriel Magalhães” and “Martin’s Odegaard technical ability\".\n\nBut, Havertz said: “Defending from William Saliba,” to the surprise of Arsenal supporters who could not help but voice their thoughts on the player’s admission, via social media.\n\nOne fan said: “Kaiii wants to defend, bro, let's focus on G/A assistants.”\n\nA second added: “[Kai] Havertz, as our striker, wants to defend. We are finished.”\n\nA third exclaimed: “Havertz can’t mention 'striker' qualities because he thinks he’s got them already… stop dragging him.”\n\nWith another saying: “My striker wants to defend. I'm finished.”\n\nA fifth asked: “Defending of Saliba? Arteta still thinks the guy should've been LCM, I'm convinced. The moment that project failed, Arteta has grilled him ever since.”\n\nOf course, Havertz already presumably backs his own ability as an attacker, which could be the reason he chose to highlight Saliba’s defensive skill.\n\nDespite some fan’s claims regarding Havertz and Arteta, the Arsenal boss complimented his player in October.\n\n“I think he [Kai Havertz]’s an amazing role model,” Arteta explained in October during a press conference. “The way he behaves every day, the way he is as a person, the way he lives his life, how much he loves to play football to compete.”\n\n“Again, part of that at this level is to handle and manage difficult situations. I think he’s an amazing example of that.”",

      "article_text": "Ally McCoist has opened up on living with Dupuytren’s contracture; an incurable condition that causes his fingers to bend towards his palms.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Rangers striker, who recently received an OBE for services to football and broadcasting, is arguably one of the most popular pundits in the game through his work with Amazon Prime, TNT Sports and ITV.\n\nHe is also a regular on radio station talkSPORT and this week, McCoist revealed that he is suffering from an incurable condition that impacts his everyday life.\n\nDupuytren's contracture, also known as Viking disease, is an abnormal thickening of the skin in the palm of the hand which can cause the fingers to curl towards the palm or pull sideways.\n\nIt has been given the name Viking disease due to its prevalence in the north of Europe and those of Northern European descent.\n\nAccording to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking, and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

      "article_text": "A decision has been reached on APT rule amendments after Manchester City challenged the Premier League.\n\nIn June City launched unprecedented legal action against the Premier League in a bid to stop Associated Party Transaction rules which were brought in back in 2021.\n\nThe club claimed that previous rules were \"unlawful\" and submitted a 165-page legal document ahead of a legal hearing where City achieved some success and were victorious in seven of their key arguments.\n\nIn order for the rules to be updated, 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs needed to be in favour of the proposed changes. However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the League.”",

      "article_text": "Former Liverpool CEO Peter Moore has revealed what he knows about the discussions regarding Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk’s contracts.\n\nMoore, 69, was the Reds’ CEO between 2017 and 2020, and his work coincided with Jurgen Klopp’s Champions League and Premier League winning success – in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nSeveral of the players involved in the triumphs are still at the club, with Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Van Dijk’s futures still unclear.\n\nAll three players are set to see their contracts expire at the end of the season, with Moore’s fellow Liverpudlian Alexander-Arnold heavily linked with a move to La Liga outfit Real Madrid, with fans giving their thoughts on the situation earlier this week.\n\nThe former Liverpool chief was no stranger to dealing with these types of situations during his tenure at Anfield, and he explained what he knew about the situation.\n\n“I don't know what's going to happen [with the contracts],” he told Soccerex in Miami [via Liverpool Echo].\n\n“If it's Trent [Alexander-Arnold], it's Virgil [van Dijk], it's Mo [Salah]. It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool. Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three.\n\n“I don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n“Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds when speaking to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

      "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Ruben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
      "article_text": "Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

      "headline": "Forging new Manchester United identity is my key task, claims Ruben Amorim",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has said Manchester United cannot rely on their history and that his most important task is to create a new identity for the club. The head coach admitted he had taken on a long-term project but that there was an immediate need for improved results.\n\nAmorim’s first game will be next Sunday in the Premier League at Ipswich. He is yet to receive his work permit but United anticipate the paperwork will be completed soon. The Portuguese, who replaces Erik ten Hag, has signed a contract until June 2027 at United, who sit 13th in the Premier League.\n\n“We know that we need time, but we have to win time,” Amorim told United’s club media. “To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So since day one we will start with our identity.\n\n“Of course we are going to prepare the games, but we will focus a lot in our game model. How to play, how to press, these small things, small details. You cannot go 100% on every detail because it will be confusing for the players. So if I have to say one thing, my main goal, my first goal, is identity.”\n\nUnited have won the Premier League 13 times but have been in steady decline since their most recent title, in 2013. Amorim, asked whether history should inspire the team, said: “That’s for sure. That’s why we are Manchester United. That’s why we are … a long time ago, we don’t win the Premier League. But if you ask, Manchester United is the biggest club in England. So this is part of the history, it is not now. So we have to address that, to show that and to try to win again.”\n\nAmorim said he was excited about the club’s plans to build a new stadium or redevelop Old Trafford, which came up in conversation with the chief executive, Omar Berrada.\n\nAfter sacking Ten Hag, Berrada and the sporting director, Dan Ashworth, travelled to Lisbon to convince Amorim he was the man to instigate a new era at United. “When Manchester United talked to me, Omar, they told me about their plans and you get excited,” Amorim said.\n\n“It’s a real honour because I was the first choice to start that path. So it’s a great responsibility. But you feel honoured and excited to be part of that. And we know that if the team plays well and wins games, everything looks so much better and the people really start to believe in the new stadium and new ideas. So, we know that we are the engine of the football. Manchester United is the engine of the Premier League in my opinion.”\n\nThe former Sporting head coach arrived at United’s Carrington training ground on Monday to hold meetings and took a tour of Old Trafford on Thursday as he gets used to his new surroundings. He met a number of players not on international duty, including Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro, but will have to wait until the middle of next week to get a full squad to work with.\n\n“It’s hard to explain,” Amorim replied when asked what it was like to be in Manchester. “It’s strange because it’s a feeling of belonging at the first day. And I know that it’s going to be tough. I know it’s a massive challenge, but I feel quite relaxed. I feel at home and I think that is important in the beginning. So, I’m very excited.”\n\nThe makeup of Amorim’s backroom staff is still to be confirmed but it was announced on Monday that Ruud van Nistelrooy would leave. The Dutchman, who had been in interim charge, returned in the summer to work under Ten Hag at the club where he spent five years as a player but it was decided there was no room for him in the new regime.\n\n“To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans,” Van Nistelrooy posted on X on Friday. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support. It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon – not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!",

      "article_text": "The Manchester United captain, Bruno Fernandes, has been praised for helping an unwell passenger on a plane.\n\nSusanna Lawson from Manchester was sitting on the row just behind Fernandes on their easyJet flight to Lisbon and witnessed the moment the midfielder caught a man who appeared to have collapsed. She said Fernandes called for help and stayed with the man for a few minutes before air stewards attended to the passenger.\n\n“At some point during the flight, Bruno got up and went to the back, presumably to the toilet. After a couple of minutes, we heard: ‘Can we get help? We need help. Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him. The other stewards went running up the plane to help and luckily there was a spare seat right at the back, so they all got the gentleman into the seat. Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it. [The air stewards] just called for help and help came.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

      "article_text": "Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n--------------------------------\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer.\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. \n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler.\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was hesitant to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be executed by the current squad. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, revealing he is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt.\n\n6\n\nIpswich's young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap’s values are shooting up by the week as they have set themselves fair for the future.\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman Ivan Toney in the summer but have shown impressive attacking prowess without him. However, their rotten away form is a concern, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road.\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, the situation with José Sá calling for medical attention demonstrated how the game can be slowed down unfairly, resulting in further instructions from the coach.\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nCrysencio Summerville is beginning to make his mark at West Ham, standing out as West Ham’s most consistent threat against Everton and offering hope in a struggling squad.\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nHarry Wilson’s third goal of the week from the bench raises the question of what he needs to do to start for Fulham, demonstrating his competition for a starting spot is fierce. \n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 \n",

      "headline": "Ruben Amorim yet to be granted visa despite starting Manchester United job on Monday",
      "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”\n\nSteve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. “Jamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn’t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,” the Leicester manager said. “Ricky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.”",

      "headline": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester",
      "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester\n\nEleven days after Manchester United routed Leicester under Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Carabao Cup here, the interim manager signed off with another easy-street win over the Foxes and so ends his four-game term unbeaten.\n\nIn all the Dutchman has three victories, and for this one he could thank Bruno Fernandes, who graced a 250th United appearance by scoring the first goal and causing enough trouble for the hapless Victor Kristiansen to bundle past his goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for the second.\n\nFernandes’s goal was a fourth of Van Nistelrooy’s brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain’s previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag has been replaced by Rúben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is due to be on Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one.\n\nFernandes said: “It was a long time that I wasn’t scoring and now goals are coming in the last few games.”\n\nIn an unsurprising move, Van Nistelrooy’s one change from the XI that drew with Chelsea last Sunday was finding a place for the explosive aggression of Amad Diallo – Alejandro Garnacho was the fall guy – and his thrust had the visitors on their heels throughout.\n\nOne dart swept the 22-year-old deep into Leicester territory and provoked Abdul Fatawu into upending him. Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared.\n\nUnited hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped.\n\nThe first of Diallo’s double in Thursday’s 2-0 Europa League victory over Paok was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out.\n\nThe Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes’s opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper’s team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner.\n\nUnited were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him – understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat André Onana at close range.\n\nCue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi. Yet overall United were akin to a boxer ahead on points keeping the opposing pugilist at arm’s length with their jab: of this, Harry Winks’ hit-and-hope effort was emblematic.\n\nBut the gaps in midfield remained in quick transition and so Winks’ lob into Buonanotte left United scrambling and Mazraoui appearing to take him down. This occurred on the borderline of the area but Peter Bankes gave neither penalty or free-kick, the referee invoking the travelling faithful’s ire.\n\nA far more sour pill was theirs to swallow next, in what was a calamity of errors from those in blue. Mazraoui’s flighted delivery was missed comically by both Jannik Vestergaard and Wout Faes, and Kristiansen’s nightmare continued as the ball glanced off the marauding Fernandes’ thigh and pinged in off the defender for an own goal and 2-0. The half ended with Diallo – who else? – burning a hole through Leicester and shooting, though the sharp Hermansen beat his effort away.\n\nCould United close this out? Being unable to seal the deal has been one of their major faults. Manuel Ugarte was a fire-dousing dynamo who did his best to ensure they did so. A chop of Buonanotte that gave a free-kick near United’s D was due to this enthusiasm but the hash Leicester made of the dead ball let him off the hook.\n\nOn 57 minutes Van Nistelrooy removed a disappointing Rashford for Garnacho and Diogo Dalot for Jonny Evans (perhaps for a knock), Lisandro Martínez moving to left-back and Mazraoui to right-back.\n\nAfter a clip on the ankle that needed treatment, Martínez fed Garnacho but he muddled down a cul-de-sac near the left corner flag and James Justin mopped up. The winger did the precise same thing after a glorious left-footed 40-yard Ugarte parabola took him clear. As Garnacho reached the area, a cutback on Faes failed, and he fell over.\n\nBut the 20-year-old laughed last and loudest thanks to a seventh goal of the campaign created by Fernandes’s curving pass and finished by an arrow from the winger that allowed Hermansen scant chance.\n\nHis celebration was muted. Fernandes said: “Garnacho scored a banger but didn’t celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him: ‘People will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.’”",

      "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
      "article_text": "Lucas Paquetá is struggling, Ruud van Nistelrooy nears Old Trafford farewell and will Luis Díaz play as a striker again?\n\n1\n\nBees susceptible to constant crosses\n------------------------------------\n\nBrentford have scored nine and conceded six in their past two Premier League home games. Their leaky defence did not cost them in victories over Wolves and Ipswich but they were shown up by Harry Wilson’s injury-time double on Monday night at Fulham to suggest things need to improve at the back. Wilson’s goals both came from crosses. Brentford allowed Fulham to cross the ball 43 times, although Thomas Frank was not too worried about it and was surprisingly relaxed that they led to two goals. With Ethan Pinnock and Nathan Collins, he does have centre-backs capable of dealing with the majority but it is a dangerous game to play. Bournemouth will have taken note and their fine wingers and full-backs will probably target the space afforded out wide.\n\n2\n\nKamada the main man with Eze sidelined\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe news that Eddie Nketiah is set for a spell on the sidelines after picking up a hamstring injury in training this week may have given Oliver Glasner less of a headache over whether to prefer the £30m signing to his main striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, but the the Crystal Palace manager goes into Saturday’s crucial home game against Fulham short of firepower, with only three fit forwards to choose from. With Eberechi Eze still out with his own hamstring problem, the responsibility to provide creativity could fall on the shoulders of Daichi Kamada after he scored the winner in the League Cup win over Aston Villa last week. The Japan forward – the club’s highest-paid player – has taken time to settle in London despite playing under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt but appears to have found his form in the last two matches.\n\n3\n\nPaquetá has badly gone off the boil\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt is not a coincidence that West Ham improved after taking off Lucas Paquetá at half-time during their win over Manchester United two weeks ago. The Brazilian’s decline has been dramatic, albeit not too surprising. Paquetá, once a target for Manchester City, has been charged with a breach of the Football Association’s betting regulations and is at risk of a lengthy ban. Playing under those conditions cannot be easy and the midfielder has often looked unfocused this season. Yet West Ham need Paquetá performing. He remains West Ham’s most creative talent and must step up for the visit of Everton – assuming, that is, he keeps his spot in Julen Lopetegui’s starting XI.\n\n4\n\nFernandes gives Saints a sporting chance\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith each passing week the signing of Mateus Fernandes looks increasingly good business for Southampton, particularly the decision to tie him to a five-year contract on his arrival in August. The fleet-footed central midfielder who played under Rúben Amorim at Sporting distributes the ball sensibly and has an impressive engine, evidenced by a crucial role linking defence and attack in last Saturday’s precious victory over Everton. “Top talent, but nowhere near ready to play for anyone else. He needs a good couple of years here for us first,” quipped Russell Martin of the 20-year-old’s form, which will doubtless attract attention from elsewhere. Aaron Ramsdale was also outstanding in goal for Southampton last weekend. Nineteenth meets 20th at Molineux and rock-bottom Wolves are naturally desperate for a win: their finishing will need to be calm and clinical.\n\n5\n\nBrighton look to capitalise on City’s slump\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBrighton’s record against Manchester City does not make happy reading. Not since a 3-2 victory at the end of the 2020-21 season have they tasted victory over Pep Guardiola’s side, when Dan Burn scored to cap a famous comeback victory from two goals down and end City’s winning 12-match away run. Fabian Hürzeler will have his first opportunity to take the biggest scalp in the top flight after failing to get anything out of their back-to-back games against Liverpool in the League Cup and the Premier League. The 31-year-old will fancy his side’s chances against a City side that have suffered three successive defeats in all competitions. Brighton’s array of attacking threats should make it a testing afternoon for the visitors.\n\n6\n\nDíaz to continue as a central striker?\n--------------------------------------\n\nUnai Emery must hope Aston Villa learn fast from their collapse at Tottenham last week given Liverpool’s considerable and decisive second-half improvements against Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton. Arne Slot’s deployment of Luis Díaz as a central striker against Leverkusen proved a resounding success with the Colombian registering the first hat-trick of his Liverpool career. The decision was shaped by the absences of Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa (both of whom are likely to miss out again on Saturday), Darwin Núñez’s recent workload and Díaz’s ability to unsettle the Leverkusen central defender Jonathan Tah with runs in behind. The temptation to leave Díaz up top will be strong, given the 27-year-old scored more goals in one night than Núñez has delivered all season.\n\n7\n\nVan Nistelrooy nears Old Trafford farewell\n------------------------------------------\n\nManchester United’s game against Leicester serves as a farewell to Ruud van Nistelrooy – this being the last of his four-match interim manager spell – and the start, 24 hours afterwards, of Rúben Amorim’s tenure as the new permanent manager. Van Nistelrooy has stated on more than one occasion he wishes to stay on in some capacity under the Portuguese but it remains unclear how valuable a win over Leicester would be to his continued employment at Old Trafford. A fourth league victory of this troubled campaign for United would certainly help, against visitors who arrive on 10 points, just two points and two places below their hosts.\n\n8\n\nWood burning to turn up heat on Howe\n------------------------------------\n\nIt seems foolish to think that things can get much better for Forest. They head into the weekend sitting third in the table, a whopping eight places above Newcastle. One of the key factors in Forest’s success is the impressive form of Chris Wood; no one would have expected him to have eight goals in 10 games but the New Zealand striker has been clinical. After a slow start to his Forest career since joining from Sunday’s visitors, Nuno Espírito Santo is helping Wood flourish by constantly having wingers who know where to find the man in the middle of the box. Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi are exciting and effective, while Jota Silva and Ramón Sosa come off the bench to keep things fresh. Wood will be extremely eager to show Newcastle what happens when a team plays to his strength, having scored four in 35 league appearances for the club before being sold on. Wood hit a hat-trick at St James’ Park last season, so knows how to hurt them.\n\n9\n\nCajuste ready to take reins from Phillips\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAfter two straight 4-1 home victories, Ange Postecoglou welcomes the league’s second worst defence to north London. Kieran McKenna will need something akin to a cunning plan if Ipswich are to secure a first victory of the season on Sunday. The manager will have a decision to make over who to combine in midfield after Kalvin Phillips was dismissed in the draw against Leicester. Jens Cajuste is the obvious choice to replace the Manchester City loanee and sit alongside Sam Morsy. The Swede has started twice and made the same amount of appearances off the bench in the league since arriving for the season from Napoli. Having made 71 career starts and 56 outings as a substitute across four clubs, he will be desperate to get a run in the team under McKenna. Cajuste has shown brief promise and Phillips is yet to indicate a return to his best, so this is a fine opportunity for the 25-year-old to prove he can be relied upon.\n\n10\n\nChelsea players must step up if Palmer is out\n---------------------------------------------\n\nChelsea may get another opportunity to prove they are not Cole Palmer FC this weekend. It was Mauricio Pochettino who coined the phrase, doing so when the best creative player in England was absent for the trip to Arsenal last April. Pochettino wanted his players to shine without Palmer, but the ploy was unsuccessful. Chelsea were humiliated in a 5-0 defeat and will hope they fare better if Palmer is absent when Arsenal visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. The England international was fortunate to escape serious injury after being chopped down by United’s Lisandro Martínez last Sunday and has not trained fully this week. He is a doubt and Pochettino’s replacement, Enzo Maresca, could need Chelsea’s other attacking midfielders to take on more responsibility. Although Maresca has plenty of options, so much goes through Palmer.",

      "headline": "Van Nistelrooy in dark over Manchester United future under Amorim",
      "article_text": "Van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now to see if Amorim has messaged – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want for my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me, it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea, and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room; it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put in a big performance.\n\n“The first half against Paok wasn’t good. We hardly created anything, and Paok neither. We didn’t get going, and our possession wasn’t good enough, and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good; it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

      "headline": "Amad Diallo ends Manchester United’s European drought by seeing off Paok",
      "article_text": "Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more games without winning in last season’s Champions League.\n\nSo a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever 50th-minute header. The second an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the defender’s manhandling, then fired a shot into the left corner, via a deflection.\n\nAs Ruud van Nistelrooy, United’s interim manager, said: “The second goal had everything in it that for me is Amad Diallo. He fought to take the ball off the Paok defender, pushed through to get the shot, and had the quality to curl it round the goalkeeper.”\n\nUnited’s results in continental competition this season were 1-1 against Twente, 3-3 at Porto and 1-1 at Fenerbahce. Hardly a roll of honour and when Van Nistelrooy rotated Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt for Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf in central defence, and Diallo for Marcus Rashford in attack, you wondered whether three points would finally be garnered.\n\nThe first half suggested not. Razvan Lucescu configured his Greek champions in a 4-2-3-1 that was a carbon copy of Van Nistelrooy’s shape and Mady Camara, the visiting No 10, exposed a familiar faultline when running into a gap, passing, collecting later in the move, then shooting.\n\nDiallo jinked about infield, fed Noussair Mazraoui, who switched the ball back into space on the right. This invited Casemiro to run on and hit an instant delivery to the far post where Alejandro Garnacho headed against Jonny’s arm, but a corner rather than penalty was the decision. The referee – and VAR – made the same call later when Diallo went down under Baba’s challenge.\n\nDiallo was United’s bright light. His next act was to drop the ball on to Rasmus Højlund’s head but, twisting, the centre-forward’s header was insipid. A 65% possession rate showed the home team’s dominance. As usual, the problem was execution in the final third. Earlier, Garnacho fluffed a regulation pass to an overlapping colleague in Paok’s area. Now he offered a repeat.\n\nAs they headed for the break – nearly behind due to a Camara rocket that burned Onana’s fingertips when deflecting over – toothless was the report on United’s opening 45 minutes. Van Nistelrooy, a ruthless assassin when United’s striker, needed to address this when his troops trailed off for the interval refreshments.\n\nYet more of the same followed. Garnacho did manage to locate Dalot on the overlap this time but the latter failed to find Fernandes as he arrived in Paok’s area. Fernandes showed the defender how it is done, as United discovered ruthlessness at last. Along the left, Garnacho glanced up and tapped to his captain who chipped in a precise ball that had the excellent Diallo leaping and looping a header back across goal which wrongfooted Dominik Kotarski, the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nUnited were serving up another smorgasbord of chances, but too many were spurned. Soon after Diallo’s second he hurt his leg and was replaced despite appearing to be fine. United will hope so ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.",

Amorim, who will arrive in England next week to replace Erik ten Hag, prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.\n\n“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s Europa League game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them [Sporting], by the way. Different system, but the ­players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”\n\nUnited have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester and a league draw against Chelsea but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim, who will take charge of one more Sporting game on Sunday, about the team or his future.\n\nOnana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”\n\nOne player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”\n\nUnited have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.",

        "article_text": "Premier League clubs have voted to approve changes to rules governing commercial deals, despite opposition from Manchester City, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa.\n\nAt a meeting in London on Friday, clubs took under 30 minutes to approve the changes to Associated Party Transaction regulations (APTs).\n\nClubs voted 16 in favour and four against. Manchester City and Aston Villa had both written to rival clubs before the meeting to seek support.\n\nFor changes to be approved, a minimum of 14 Premier League clubs needed to vote in favour.\n\nFriday's vote came after an independent panel found aspects of the Premier League's rules to be unlawful earlier this year, following a lawsuit instigated by Manchester City.\n\nAPT rules were formed by the Premier League to prevent clubs from profiting from commercial or sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners that are deemed above \"fair market value\".\n\nThe Premier League said the rule changes relate to integrating the assessment of shareholder loans and include the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at fair market value by virtue of relationships with associated parties,\" read a Premier League statement.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that representatives from Chelsea and Manchester United both spoke at the meeting before the vote, urging clubs to vote through the changes.\n\nManchester City's representative declined to speak.\n\nThis will be a major relief for the Premier League, and a blow to City. Today's vote was seen as a landmark test of the top-flight's ability to uphold rules that it claims are crucial in maintaining competitive balance and fairness, by ensuring commercial deals that clubs agree with companies linked to their owners represent fair market value and are not artificially inflated.\n\nHad seven or more clubs voted against the league's proposed changes and vetoed the amendments, the fear was that state-connected clubs such as Manchester City and Newcastle United could have full scope to secure ever more lucrative sponsorship deals, fuelling wage inflation.\n\nHowever, today's vote also risks deepening the unprecedented division that is now coming to define a league once known for its unity.\n\nCity made clear they felt the amendments are unlawful and insisted no vote should take place before the panel issued a further determination. We now know three clubs agreed with them.\n\nLosing today's vote may mean City now take the further litigation they were threatening, adding to the league's already spiralling legal bills and exacerbating the power struggle that the league is having to navigate.\n\nThis dispute had already escalated into an unseemly war of words, with the Premier League accusing the champions of \"baseless assertions\", before City then claimed the top-flight was \"rushing through\" what it labelled \"unlawful\" rule changes.\n\nFriday's vote is unlikely to be the end of the matter.\n\nSimon Stone,\nChief football news reporter,\nSources have told BBC Sport that City's position around APTs remains unchanged despite Friday's vote.\n\nLast week, City wrote to the other 19 Premier League clubs to say they were \"concerned\" about \"unlawful amendments\" to the APT rules.\n\nThey feel last month's tribunal ruling, which demanded changes to the Premier League's rules, effectively meant they need to be completely replaced, not tweaked as has happened.\n\nClarification from the tribunal is still to be received, but City feel its recommendations will end up siding with them, which will effectively make today's vote irrelevant.",

        "headline": "12:59 21 NovemberGo big or go home on Arsenal's defence - FPL tips & team of week, published at 12:59 21 NovemberGo big or go home on Arsenal's defence - FPL tips & team of week",
        "article_text": "We're approaching a great part of the season for Fantasy Premier League players. No pesky international breaks until March, midweek fixtures coming up and the game-packed Christmas period. It's also a time for some big decisions so this team of the week sets that tone - no Erling Haaland, no Manchester City at all and triple Arsenal defence. How about that! The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit. What a week! Only two players blanked, Bruno Fernandes hauled in 17 points and 28-point captain Mohamed Salah delivered again. That led to a gameweek rank of about 18,000 out of 10.7 million. Goalkeeper and defence David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.5m Gabriel, Arsenal, £6.1m William Saliba, Arsenal, £6m All home to Nottingham Forest Yes, you're reading that right. I've gone for a triple-up on Arsenal's defence this week. This is a part gut feel and part data-based decision. Arsenal had the best defence last season, they started out in the same way this time and they haven't suddenly lost the ability to defend. Mikel Arteta has most of his first-choice defenders back and it's time for the Gunners to make a statement after no wins in four. Forest are flying in the league but they are bottom six for expected goals (xG) with 14.54 and have scored just 15 in 11 games. They've had success from corners this season but Arsenal have conceded just four shots from set-pieces. I'm benching Chris Wood in my own FPL team and expecting a low-scoring win to nil for Arsenal. Lewis Hall, Newcastle, £4.4m - home to West Ham The new England international is about to become a budget favourite with a decent run of fixtures and an enticing price. He is far and away Newcastle's most creative defender, with three big chances produced and an expected assists (xA) of 1.43. Up-and-down West Ham at home is a favourable match-up for him. Midfield Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £12.9m - away at Southampton The way Salah is producing at the moment, giving him the captain's armband is a no-brainer. He has seven double-digit returns in 11 games so far, which is astonishing. A pessimist would say that he can't carry on at that rate of production - if he does he's on for a record 369-point season - but an away game at Southampton doesn't feel like it's going to be a stumbling block. Salah has so many routes to production. Last gameweek was classic Mo - non-owners were escaping with just an assist - with Villa chasing the game and the Egyptian pouncing on a counter-attack to score with his only shot on target late on. Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.4m - away at Ipswich With the same reasoning as Salah, I'm rolling with Fernandes who is a man in form and has underproduced based on his underlying statistics. Gameweek 11's 17-point haul was coming and the Portuguese maestro often produces FPL points in spurts. Dwight McNeil, Everton, £5.7m - home to Brentford McNeil is back to fitness and he has been Everton's talisman this season. Three goals, three assists and an involvement in 60% of the goals in games he has played. Everton have only scored 10 this season but if they can't find the net against Brentford, who have the joint-second-worst defence with 22 goals conceded, then they are in trouble. Emile Smith Rowe, Fulham, £5.7m - home to Wolves The former Arsenal midfielder was a pre-season player to watch for me but is making his debut in the team of the week. Like McNeil, ESR has become a key player for Fulham and he is returning roughly every other game. He's got a knack of arriving in the box at the right time and it wouldn't be a surprise if he ends the season close to 10 goals - he has three so far in 11 games. Forwards Alexander Isak, Newcastle, £8.5m - home to West Ham The Swede is in hot form, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions. The way Newcastle play, if they were to score twice it's hard to imagine Isak isn't involved in at least one of those goals. With just four league goals so far, it's fair to say he has underwhelmed but this is a man who scored 21 last season, is on penalties and has no real threat to his starting position. I like that! Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa, £9m - home to Crystal Palace There's no Haaland in this week's team. He could easily go off at home to Spurs but Manchester City are out of form and there are forwards who should match him this week for £6m or more less. One of those is Watkins, on his own mini goal drought, but always involved in Villa's attacks and he's had 15 big chances this season - scoring five goals. Joao Pedro, Brighton, £5.5m - away at Bournemouth The Brazilian might be in a lot of FPL teams soon. He's budget-friendly, on penalties and has four returns in the five games he's appeared in this season. As long as he is fit, Pedro is the cheap striker to own, with a juicy fixture run all the way until 2025. Subs' bench Bernd Leno, Fulham, goalkeeper, £5m - home to Wolves There's enough budget for a decent bench this week, and a back-up keeper with a half-decent chance of a clean sheet. Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, midfielder, £5.7m - home to Brighton The shot monster was close to making the starting XI this week so watch him haul! Semenyo has now taken 47 shots - 10 more than any other midfielder. He only has 11 on target but he's still a very reliable threat in FPL. Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.7m - home to Crystal Palace I could easily bench boost this week! Digne, who has made this team before, is playing a goal-shy Palace side and has an assist in him. Ibrahima Konate, Liverpool, defender, £5.4m - away at Southampton Konate is your budget way into the Liverpool defence. He's had a bigger goal threat so far this season than Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Total team cost = £98.5m Team to target Brighton - Bournemouth (a), Saints (h), Fulham (a) If you haven't been considering a Brighton asset then now is the time. Their run of enticing games stretches all the way to 30 December, when they travel to Aston Villa. And even that isn't so daunting. Lots of options - Joao Pedro should be a priority.",

        "article_text": "The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One' - BBC Sport\nNeil Johnston\n\nBBC Sport journalist in Lisbon\n\n*   Published\n    \n    2 November 2024\n      \n    Updated 21 November 2024\n\n**\"I've got a problem,\" Ruben Amorim replied when his friend Bruno Simao suggested fixing up a trial game at Portuguese club Belenenses so the childhood pals could be reunited.**\n\nAmorim and Simao, who had played football together since the age of nine, had gone their separate ways after being released by their hometown club Benfica in their teens.\n\nWhile Simao had managed to get himself fixed up at nearby Belenenses, midfielder Amorim was struggling to come to terms with being let go by the club he had supported as a boy growing up in Lisbon.\n\n\"I said to Ruben: 'Why don't you come and play with me again at Belenenses?'\" Simao tells BBC Sport. \"I said I'd speak with the coach to fix up a game so he could watch him.\n\n\"Ruben replied: I cannot play, I broke my arm.'\"\n\nAmorim's football career looked over before it had even started, but Simao was persistent.\n\n\"I said: 'Don't worry, I'm sure the coach will see you and you will stay with us.'\"\n\nAnd so a trial game was arranged, with Amorim playing despite his injured arm.\n\n\"He was centre-back and the coaches told all the players: 'Take care of him because of his arm,'\" recalls Simao. \"He came through the game and stayed with us at Belenenses.\n\n\"That was the start of his professional playing career.\"\n\nA desire to succeed and a drive to overcome setbacks are recurring themes in the story of Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim.\n\nAnd it is that resilience and steely determination that has brought the 39-year-old to the point he is preparing to take charge of Manchester United for the first time - against Ipswich at Portman Road on Sunday (16:30 GMT).\n\n\"We keep in touch,\" says Simao of the youngest full-time United head coach since Wilf McGuinness, 31, in 1969.\n\n\"Ruben is godfather to my eldest daughter Carolina, who is 18. Even yesterday I messaged him about going to Manchester United.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for him to go there as a coach. They are not in a good moment but it's still a top club and for Ruben it will be wonderful.\"\n\n'Ruben cried after losing to Sporting'\nPedro Russiano remembers Amorim already being a passionate player by the age of seven at Benfica.\n\n\"When we lost against Sporting I remember the whole team cried a lot, including Ruben,\" says Russiano.\n\n\"We started to play football together 33 years ago at Benfica's school. Ruben was a very aggressive player, fighting for all the balls.\n\n\"I played on the left side of midfield and we made very good combinations. We learned a lot together. It was a good group who only thought about football.\"\n\nAbout 10 kilometres from Benfica's Estadio da Luz, which Amorim would later call home despite the early rejection, is the beautiful district of Belem on the banks of the River Tagus and where Belenenses play in the third tier of Portuguese football.\n\nIt was here Amorim made a name for himself as a player after earning a contract despite his fractured arm.\n\nBack in 2007, Belenenses, who were playing in the Primeira Liga, reached the Portuguese cup final, where they faced Sporting at Estadio Nacional - scene of Celtic's glorious 1967 European Cup triumph over Inter Milan.\n\nOn the walls of Belenenses' club museum is a framed team picture from that day 17 years ago. On the front row, second from right, is a kneeling Amorim with Candido Costa, the former Braga winger, to his left and Brazilian full-back Rodrigo Alvim to his right.\n\nHe was substituted after 71 minutes with the score 0-0. Sporting, whose side included former Manchester United winger Nani, won 1-0.\n\n\"Despite the result, it was a great game,\" says Patrick Morais de Carvalho - president of Belenenses.\n\n\"Ruben was perhaps one step ahead of the others, because he was not an exceptional player but I think he was able to assert himself by the intelligence in which he moved on the field and the way he tactically understood the game from a very young age.\"\n\nIn 2008, after more than 100 league and cup appearances, Amorim's dream came true when the club that had rejected him as a teenager came back to sign him.\n\n\"Ruben spent six years here but we knew that the club of his heart was Benfica,\" adds Morais de Carvalho.\n\nLearning from Mourinho & lunching with Man Utd players\nAmorim helped Benfica win three league titles during his nine years there. He played in both the Champions League and Europa League, and helped them beat Liverpool in 2010.\n\nHe is a week older than Cristiano Ronaldo - his Portugal team-mate at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.\n\nWhile at Benfica, he had loan spells at Braga and, towards the end of his playing career, in Qatar with Al-Wakrah.\n\nBut Amorim had already developed a reputation as someone who absorbed information like a sponge, and as his playing career came to an end he turned his attention to coaching.\n\nIn 2017, aged 32, he undertook a postgraduate degree at the University of Lisbon, where Jose Mourinho - Manchester United's manager at the time - was a coordinator and lecturer on its High Performance Coaching course.\n\nThe course was conducted in English, which Amorim had learned at secondary school.\n\n\"Ruben was one of the best students and for that reason he had a one-week internship at Manchester United,\" says Antonio Veloso - professor at the Faculty of Human Kinetics at the University of Lisbon.\n\n\"Basically it involved following the preparation of one game.\"\n\nAmorim was no stranger to some of United's players having been team-mates with Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof at Benfica.\n\n\"I remember talking with Matic and he was saying: 'Of course Ruben is going to be a coach,'\" adds Prof Veloso. \"All of Ruben's colleagues understood that he was one of those players who had a tremendous tactical knowledge and understanding of what coaching was about.\"\n\nDuring his week in Manchester, Amorim joined Lindelof and Matic for lunch in the canteen and, after a busy day of learning, he was invited to dine with an impressed Mourinho at Juan Mata's restaurant in the city centre.\n\nSoon afterwards, a coaching role came up at Casa Pia - a Lisbon-based club playing in the third tier at the time.\n\nProf Veloso added: \"People in football asked me: 'Ruben did the programme with you - how do you think he will do as a coach?'\n\n\"I said: 'He will be a top coach.'\"\n\n'He is the second Special One'\nAmorim had started out as a coaching intern at Casa Pia before taking full charge and guiding them to promotion on a minimal budget.\n\n\"As a coach, the most important thing for Ruben is to get a close relationship with his players,\" adds Simao, who played for his friend at Casa Pia after recovering from a traffic accident in 2018 which left him in a coma.\n\n\"The accident was about the same time he was appointed coach at Casa Pia.\n\n\"Sometime later I sent him a message and said: 'Look, what do you think about having me in your team?' He said: 'Please, we cannot mix our relationship. You were in a coma four months ago, you are 33, and you are an expensive player for Casa Pia.' \n\n\"Then, after one week, he messaged me to say: 'Look, I want you in my team. Let's make it happen.'\"\n\nIt was not all plain sailing, however, and Simao remembers Amorim's reaction when things did not go to plan.\n\n\"I have seen many times him getting angry because he wants to play well and win.\"\n\nOne such occasion came following a defeat by Amora, managed at the time by Russiano - Amorim's friend from childhood.\n\n\"It was very good to see a good friend again,\" says Russiano. \"We spoke and remembered the things when we were young. My team won 1-0!\n\n\"At Casa Pia he decided to play a different system and switched to 3-4-3. They went on a run that put them in first position.\"\n\nAnd with a nod back to Mourinho, Russiano adds: \"He is the second 'Special One'.\"\n\nVictor Seabra Franco, president of Casa Pia, says Amorim was paid an \"insignificant\" amount of money because of a tight budget and limited resources.\n\n\"I won't mention the numbers, because they're so small that it's not worth mentioning them,\" he adds.\n\n\"For the matches, which were at 3pm in Alentejo or Algarve, we would set off early in the morning. We trained at night. Ruben changed things and we started training in the morning.\n\n\"Sometimes there was no water, for example, but even with all the difficulties, there was a group, and Ruben - and those players liked Ruben.\n\n\"They did everything so that Casa Pia and Ruben could win.\"\n\nThere were tears shed among the players when Amorim announced he was leaving Casa Pia after just one season.\n\n\"That's the saddest memory of Ruben's presence - the day he left Casa Pia,\" says Seabra Franco.\n\n'Amorim went on to manage Braga before setting about repairing fractured relationships between officials and fans at Sporting in 2020.\n\n\"There was a lot of instability before he took charge,\" explains Sporting fan Andrew Duraes. \"The fanbase was not happy at all.\n\n\"Ruben was the main beacon of hope. It's going to be emotional when he leaves. There was an elderly gentleman here outside the ground who broke down in tears when it was announced he had been given permission to talk to United.\"\n\nAmorim took charge of Sporting in March 2020, and within 14 months delivered a first league title in 19 years. He has since won another.\n\n\"We weren't too sure at first,\" Sporting fan Joao Costa says of a boyhood Benfica fan taking charge of his club.\n\n\"Now? Ruben is worthy of being in charge of any club.\"\n\nBut are United taking a gamble on a young coach who has not managed outside Portugal?\n\nHis countryman Mourinho, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick tried and failed to revive and sustain the glory days since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in May 2013.\n\nUnited then spent about £600m on new players for Erik ten Hag, who led them to one FA Cup and one League Cup before he was sacked last month.\n\nSome Sporting fans have questioned whether Amorim is the right man to replace the Dutchman.\n\n\"The job is too big for him at the moment,\" England-based John said outside the Estadio Jose Alvalade. \"I don't think Ruben has had enough years here and he's also inheriting a lot of prima donna players at Manchester United.\n\n\"He's a great coach but he hasn't got enough experience.\"\n\nYet speak to those close to Amorim and they are in no doubt he can be a success at Old Trafford.\n\n\"He uses ideas from all the top coaches that he is always observing,\" says Prof Veloso. \"When you do that and mix it up like a very good chef - taking ideas from different recipes - you do a very good plate.\"\n\nAnd so back to Belenenses, where it all began for Amorim in terms of his playing career taking off.\n\nWill Amorim, who has signed a contract until June 2027, last longer than the two years and seven months Mourinho managed at United?\n\nMorais de Carvalho says: \"He does believe that in Manchester United he'll have better players, and he thinks he's smart enough and will have the capacity to adapt the games in a different way of playing, a different system and if that happens he'll be able to maybe create some magic.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United released a seven-minute video on Monday to mark Ruben Amorim's first training session as the club's head coach.\n\nPlayers including Casemiro and Marcus Rashford put out positive posts on their social media accounts to state how well it had gone.\n\nThe editing of a session that would normally last more than an hour gave a few small clues about Amorim's thinking before his first match in charge at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nThere was also a bit of fitness news - and a definite subtle message to try to suggest issues from Erik ten Hag's tenure are now being addressed.\n\nEngland duo Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo, and new signing Leny Yoro, were all involved as they step up their recovery from recent injuries.\n\nHarry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof were not shown playing any part. All missed international duty this month through injury.\n\nAndre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were all absent on international duty.\n\nMuch of the debate around Amorim's appointment has centred around his tactics and how he preferred to operate with three central defenders and two wing-backs at Sporting, an alien concept at United going back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\n\nAmorim said in his interview with club media on Friday fans would see \"an idea\" at Portman Road this weekend. Judging by this footage, a back three will be part of that.\n\nJonny Evans was flanked by Yoro to his right and Shaw to the left. Antony was the right wing-back, Tyrell Malacia the left wing-back.\n\nCasemiro and Mainoo filled the deeper midfield slots, with Mason Mount - who applied a first-time finish to an Antony cross - Amad Diallo and Rashford in the forward roles.\n\nOne of the major criticisms of recent United incarnations, going back long before Ten Hag's time, is a lack of work-rate, particularly when it comes to tracking back.\n\nUnited are not saying who signed off the video edit but it seems fairly clear some thought has gone into what was released.\n\nIn possession and attacking, four times, players were shown chasing back hard after Amorim had given the signal for a lost ball and a counter-attack.\n\nIt was repeated so often in such a short space of time, it was as though someone at Old Trafford wanted it to be known Amorim is trying to address United's issues in transition.\n\nIn the summer, Mainoo was one of three players - Hojlund and Garnacho being the others - who were ring-fenced as United made it clear they were willing to listen to offers for virtually all their first-team squad.\n\nAs a local boy and academy graduate, Mainoo, 19, is the pin-up boy for how the club wants to be represented.\n\nSo, while it is safe to assume Amorim singled out more than one player for a spot of impromptu coaching, the discussion with Mainoo was the one that made it into the public domain.\n\nAmorim showed Mainoo what he wanted from him in terms of body shape and positioning - and what different options he could have by moving just a short distance.\n\nIt is worth remembering Amorim has been appointed as head coach, not a manager, as Ten Hag had been.\n\nIt is Amorim who is guiding players through the patterns he wants to establish.\n\nThere were smiles alongside the messages in the edit of Amorim on Monday.\n\nThe nearest we saw to ferocity was his demand to \"not lose the ball\" seconds before intervening to tell Evans they had lost possession and needed to regain their position.\n\nIt was insightful to a point. But it was also the picture United wanted the world to see.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United figures are already having doubts over major summer signing.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee scored on his Man United debut and that remains his only goal after 17 appearances for the club.\n\nManchester United are having serious doubts about summer signing Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nSome senior club figures have concluded striker Zirkzee, who has scored one goal in 17 games, is not good enough four months on from his £36.5million transfer from Bologna.\n\nZirkzee, 23, was not even named on the bench for the Netherlands in their Nations League win over Georgia last week as United flop Wout Weghorst started up front. Zirkzee started as the No.10 in the Netherlands’ 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday night but was replaced by Weghorst in the 77th minute.\n\nUnited have been in dire goalscoring form this season and have managed a meagre 12 goals in 12 Premier League games. They have a 0 goal difference following the 3-0 defeat of Leicester City.\n\nZirkzee has not scored since his debut against Fulham more than three months ago while Rasmus Hojlund has scraped two goals in 12 games. Hojlund has also failed to score in his past 12 matches for Denmark. Club sources concede scrutiny of a striker summer signing is inevitable when they are enduring a drought.\n\nUnited are expected to be in the market for a dependable goalscorer next year, which would almost certainly require the sale or loan of one of their incumbent forwards. Hojlund has tallied 18 goals in 55 games for United, having netted 27 from 87 matches for previous clubs Atalanta, Sturm Graz and Copenhagen. Zirkzee got 36 goals in 126 games for Bayern Munich, Parma, Anderlecht and Bologna.\n\nHojlund commanded an up-front fee of £64m rising to £72m in July 2023 after United refused to deal with Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy amid then-manager Erik Ten Hag’s desire to sign Harry Kane, who had entered the final year of his contract. The failure to recruit a proven goalscorer contributed to United ending the 2023-24 Premier League season in eighth and with a -1 goal difference.\n\nZirkzee has lined up in two of United’s past nine matches - against Fenerbahce in the Europa League and Leicester in the League Cup. His last league start was in the 3-0 home humbling by Tottenham on September 29.\n\nFormer United caretaker manager Ruud van Nistelrooy said earlier this month the squad lacked a consistent goalscorer. \"Yeah, I agree that when you want to be a successful side in the Premier League and in Europe - and that is what the build is all about - you're going to need a certain amount of goals.\"\n\nAlejandro Garnacho is United’s top scorer this term with seven goals, followed by Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford on four. Rashford is without a goal in eight games and appeared to play as the striker in new head coach Ruben Amorim’s maiden team training session on Monday as United prepare to switch to a 3-4-3 formation.\n\nAmorim’s preference is for the striker to stay high, which jars with Zirkzee’s tendency to drop deep. Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres plundered 23 goals in 16 games for Sporting under Amorim this season and has a £63m release clause in the summer.",

The illuminating footage of Amorim in the thick of it during his first team training session at Carrington has further fuelled excitement.\n\nTraining sessions are sensitive and United highlighted that behind the erection of a wall earlier this season that shielded the first team’s pitch. On Monday evening, seven minutes of Amorim timing attacks from back to front was aired.\n\nIt confirmed Amorim is indoctrinating the players in the ways of his much-hyped 3-4-3, with potential early indicators as to who will start at Ipswich Town on Sunday. There was also the rare sight of United players sprinting towards their own goal.\n\nLeny Yoro was informed on Monday he was down to start for the Under 21s in the National League Cup at Altrincham on Tuesday evening. His absence was owed to Amorim. Yoro was in the United defensive triumvirate for Amorim’s maiden session.\n\nOf all the post-Ferguson managerial appointments, only Jose Mourinho’s in 2016 rivals the buzz around his compatriot. At the time of Erik ten Hag’s overdue dismissal, it seemed unlikely United would settle on a replacement to completely unify the fanbase yet they have achieved that with Amorim.\n\nIt helped that the 39-year-old was visible in the days before United confirmed his imminent arrival, affably indulging the handful of English media representatives at his press conferences in Lisbon. More flocked to his briefings the following week as Sporting gave Manchester City a shellacking in the Champions League. United’s best result in Europe that week was not against PAOK.\n\nThe personable Amorim pressed the flesh during his tour of Old Trafford last Thursday and a handful of fortunate visitors’ own tour coincided with his. Optimism at United has not been this rife or widespread since the FA Cup final, an anomalous high among innumerable lows.\n\nIt makes it all the more peculiar that Amorim will not be introduced at Old Trafford today. He sat at the same press conference seat last week that Ten Hag did a day after the sulphurous 2021-22 campaign ended.\n\nSince David Moyes, every permanent or interim United manager has been afforded an introductory press conference at Old Trafford. In the Zoom era, Ralf Rangnick was deemed worthy of a first in-person press conference in 21 months. The Number 7 suite was opened for Mourinho, Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nA paint-by-numbers interview by in-house media with Amorim, conducted last Thursday evening, was published around 24 hours later at 7pm on Friday, a graveyard slot in the daily news cycle. United gave the impression they were burying bad news when Amorim’s arrival is only behind the FA Cup victories over Liverpool and City for their feel-good story of the calendar year.\n\nClub sources say Amorim was deliberately held back to allow him to settle into his new routine, rather than subject him to two press conferences before his first match in charge. He will hold court at Carrington at 1.30pm on Friday.\n\nThere will be up to three sections for regulars, the Sunday newspaper journalists and guests from Portugal. The upper floor of the Jimmy Murphy Centre is not vast and the event has already been billed as a probable circus by a staff member.\n\nThe key questions will eventually be asked and answered at the bum-fight this afternoon. Pre-match press conferences usually last 15 minutes. An audience with Amorim will warrant at least double that.\n\nSome at United are reluctant to be overly positive. They have seen this all before with a new manager, as those who cover them have, too. Figures at the club have welcomed Amorim's energy and his presence has been uplifting. \"He has struck all the right notes,\" one source said.\n\n\"He's more charismatic and empathetic with players and the press than Ten Hag,\" someone else who knows Amorim said. \"He will answer everything at a press conference. He tends to joke.\"\n\nAmorim worked closely with the Sporting president Frederico Varandas and sporting director Hugo Vian. His confidants believe a similar rapport is required with the United hierarchy. Amorim has spoken about his \"connection\" with chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.\n\nPortuguese sources feel Amorim will make tweaks to his anticipated 3-4-3 system. The majority of United's centre backs are well versed in the back three set-up while Diogo Dalot operated in a 3-4-3 for Porto B when United scouted him.\n\nAmorim came \"very close\" to succeeding Jurgen Klopp when Liverpool whittled down their shortlist of candidates to Amorim and Arne Slot. Manchester City earmarked Amorim as Pep Guardiola's heir had he left Manchester after ten years. He will encounter Guardiola again in next month's derby.\n\nLike Mourinho, Amorim is holed up in The Lowry Hotel, though his residency is unlikely to rival his mentor's as he is already house-hunting. United security staff have ferried Amorim to Carrington every day this week.\n\nThere is a curious sub-plot to Amorim's United debut at Portman Road. In the opposite dugout, there will be another highly-regarded 30-something coach who was a candidate to replace Ten Hag this year. Kieran McKenna is also another Mourinho protégé, having been promoted to first team coach at United in July 2018 three months after Amorim’s internship at Carrington.\n\nHad United come calling for McKenna a second time last month then his release clause would have been more expensive than Amorim’s prudent €10 million buyout. Some of the more entitled United players found McKenna’s methods to be too officious whereas the younger squad members were more receptive.\n\nOne narrative can be scrapped from this weekend’s fixture. The last time United were at Portman Road in May 2002 the game was settled by Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\nVan Nistelrooy gained “closure” with his appreciation for the United supporters at full-time against Leicester two weeks ago. Then Amorim closed the door. There was that ruthlessness, hours after Amorim's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport.\n\nThere was something else Amorim’s former colleague at Sporting mentioned: “He will 100% succeed.”",

        "article_text": "Manchester United player ratings this season so far as six get 7/10 and one gets a 2 - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United have had their worst-ever start to a Premier League season but some individuals have still performed respectably.\n\nA third of the way into the season and Manchester United are still in the bottom half of the Premier League table.\n\nUnited have lost five of their 11 league fixtures but Ruud van Nistelrooy's uplifting four-match stint as caretaker manager has ensured new head coach Ruben Amorim will inherit a more buoyant squad.\n\nDespite United's 13th-place status, they have a League Cup quarter-final next month, have four games to secure automatic qualification for the Europa League round-of-16 and will start their defence of the FA Cup in January.\n\nAmad, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro regained form under Van Nistelrooy while Alejandro Garnacho tallied two more goals under the Dutchman. Here are how the United players have rated this season so far:\n\n**Andre Onana**\nOne of a handful of performers who has had a respectable season. Made some world-class saves (Crystal Palace and Fenerbahce) and important stops (Southampton and Porto). 7\n\n**Diogo Dalot**\nAfter a reasonable 2023-24, Dalot is in a rut. He has played often enough at left back to do better there yet he is underperforming on both sides. Overplayed due to the two crocks at left back. 4\n\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\nThe best of the summer signings so far. Solid defensively and starting to become more involved in the final third. Crucially, he has been available for every game. 7\n\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\nHad some forgettable days and he fails to take command too often but showed resilience at Southampton and started to look more settled of late. 6\n\n**Lisandro Martinez**\nSeldom performed and was dropped for the first time in his United career at Aston Villa. His usually brilliant line-breaking passing has deserted him, too. 5\n\n**Jonny Evans**\nTen appearances is very good going for a stalwart who turns 37 in January. United have not lost any of the games Evans has started in and he was superb in the dreary draw with Villa. 7\n\n**Harry Maguire**\nMissed the entire bank of games between the October and November internationals due to injury. Lost his place after the second league match but equalised in Porto. 5\n\n**Victor Lindelof**\nBelatedly back in the fold after missing the first two months through injury. Only started a few matches in what has to be his final campaign. 5\n\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\nWeary in the first weeks of the season before he suffered a hamstring injury that has kept him sidelined for seven weeks. He needed a breather. 5\n\n**Casemiro**\nThe first half against Liverpool was a career nadir and he has creditably rallied with some committed performances. Unsurprisingly perked up after Ten Hag was sacked. 6\n\n**Manuel Ugarte**\nLeicester was his only accomplished performance as a league starter. Showed why United bought him at Fenerbahce and will return to a coach who trusts him. 6\n\n**Christian Eriksen**\nAlready started nine games when it looked like he would struggle to start that many back in July. Scored some lovely goals and made United more of a threat at set pieces. 7\n\n**Bruno Fernandes**\nFootball’s most durable player’s wretched start ended after he missed a match (through suspension) and had a few days off. Among the goals under Van Nistelrooy. 5\n\n**Amad**\nA decent start to the season ended with Ten Hag’s contradictory rotation. Provided two of the standout individual performances against Southampton and PAOK. 7\n\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\nUnited’s top scorer never goes into hiding. Arrested a brief slump in form with a goal of the month contender against Leicester. His trajectory continues to be an upward curve. 7\n\n**Marcus Rashford**\nWhen he was underperforming, Ten Hag kept him in. When he was performing, Ten Hag substituted him at half-time. His season ‘high’ against Porto is remembered more for that infamous interval withdrawal. Eight games without a goal. 4\n\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\nNetted the winner on his debut but already looks a lost cause. Too cumbersome, too lethargic and too impotent to be a striker for United and figures at the club know it. 2\n\n_Marks are assigned individually and players must have started five matches to earn a rating._",

        "article_text": "For Manchester United's new head coach Ruben Amorim, today is likely to be the day when the extent of the challenge that lies ahead of him becomes real.\n\nThe Portuguese will face the media for the very first time as United boss ahead of this Sunday's clash with Ipswich Town in the Premier League. Since becoming the new boss, Amorim's media duties have remained either in-house or in front of the Portuguese journalists while still Sporting manager.\n\nHowever, today marks his first press conference in the United Kingdom as the Reds' boss and we can expect the new manager to touch on plenty of topics. As well as previewing his Premier League debut; transfers, future goals and his assessment of the current squad are likely to all be on the agenda too.\n\nWhile Amorim talking to the media is the big talking point of the day, there are other areas to focus on too. The January transfer window is just around the corner and speculation about potential signings is beginning to hot up.\n\nViktor Gyokeres continues to be linked with the Reds however a deal for the Swede is more likely to be completed in the summer than this winter.\n\nReal Madrid remain confident they will beat United to the signature of Alphonso Davies. The Canada international is coming to the end of his contract in the summer and will, therefore, be able to negotiate a pre-contract with clubs abroad from the new year.\n\nOne of the clubs interested in his signature is Real, with reports stating the Spanish giants are 'favourites' and are 'confident' on securing his services from next summer onwards. Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has Ferland Mendy and Fran Garcia as left-back options, is expected to lose one of the two at the end of the season, though it's said it cannot be ruled out that both end up moving on.\n\nSpeaking to the media, former Premier League midfielder Emmanuel Petit believes that Amorim has that added ingredient which Ten Hag lacked at Old Trafford. Petit noted Amorim will stick with his philosophy, his tactics, and his style at United, in contrast to Ten Hag's frequent changes.\n\nAmorim's first media duties in this country are scheduled to begin at 2pm. Man United will be showing live coverage of the press conference on their in-house television channel, MUTV.\n\nIn an interview for TribalFootball.com, ex-United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes Amorim will need at least 18 months to implement his style at Old Trafford. He expressed that Amorim has plenty of charisma and tactical acumen necessary to create a strong identity at Manchester United.\n\nFormer City striker Sergio Aguero believes Amorim's new squad will rally to help him overcome challenges he experiences at Old Trafford. Aguero noted that Amorim is arriving with a very good record and faces the challenge of infusing United with the identity that its supporters have grown accustomed to.\n\nUnited are having serious doubts about summer signing Joshua Zirkzee, who has scored one goal in 17 games. Senior club figures have concluded that Zirkzee, who was not even named on the bench for the Netherlands in their recent match, might not be good enough after only a few months at Old Trafford.\n\nOverall, today marks a significant moment for Amorim and United as they navigate through the challenges ahead.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada has shown his feelings over Manchester City during the Premier League's Associated Party Transactions (APT) vote on Friday.\n\nThe voting comes after Man City claimed victory from an independent panel in October which concluded that the rules introduced since Newcastle United's takeover were unlawful. As a result, league officials had drawn up a new proposal and a new vote took place on Friday morning - which deemed City defeated in their attempt to stop new rules on APT being voted through.\n\nHowever, the reigning champions had warned all top-flight clubs that new rules should not be put in place before the expert opinions from the arbitration hearing had been fully considered. Aston Villa were one of the clubs who also favoured that view, but in the meeting a majority backed the Premier League's proposal.\n\nAs reported by the Press Association, City were represented by their CFO Ingo Bank at the meeting but it is claimed he didn't speak. Meanwhile, City's former football operations officer Berrada spoke in support of the amendments along with Chelsea's general counsel James Bonington.\n\nBerrada was appointed as Manchester United CEO in January but only joined in the summer upon completion of a period of gardening leave after resigning from his role at City Football Group after 11 years. His decision to speak against City in the meeting shows he has already dived fully into his new role at United.\n\nA statement by the Premier League read: \"At a Premier League Shareholders’ meeting today, clubs approved changes to the League’s Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules. The amendments to the rules address the findings of an arbitration tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year.\n\n\"The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system. This relates to integrating the assessment of shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with associated parties. These rules were introduced to provide a robust mechanism to safeguard the financial stability, integrity and competitive balance of the league.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim already has what Erik ten Hag didn't at Man United after private chat",
        "article_text": "Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag at the end of last month after a historically bad start to the Premier League season. His second season was a lot more difficult though, as United crashed out of the group stages in the Champions League and looked set not to qualify for Europe at all until they won the FA Cup. The victory over Manchester City at Wembley gave Ineos reason to extend Ten Hag's contract. However, he lasted little more than two months in charge before being sacked at the end of October. This weekend sees a new era begin at United with Ruben Amorim leading the club for the very first time at Ipswich Town. Ahead of the fixture, Carragher has penned his thoughts on the previous regime. In the piece, he opened up on a private conversation he had with Neville that was less than flattering for Ten Hag. \"The most successful managers have an aura and personality,\" he wrote. \"Only those working in the same environment can offer a first-hand account of how the manager operates behind the scenes, but for those of us on the outside looking in, perceptions matter. Without dwelling too much on United's recent past, this was a red flag against Ten Hag from day one. Two games into his reign, Gary Neville and I had the pleasure of interviewing Ten Hag at United's training ground. \"He was a polite guy but there was no sense of an x-factor. Driving away from the meeting that day, I turned to Gary and said: 'He must be a supercoach because there isn’t much charisma.' The same could hardly be said for Amorim, if early impressions are anything to go by. \"A Manchester United manager must carry the same gravitas, and although he has only given one media interview to his club’s website since being appointed, if I was a supporter I would already believe Amorim’s character will be vastly different from his predecessor,\" added Carragher.",

        "headline": "Ruben Amorim's Carrington reaction could offer Manchester United's forgotten man a new start",
        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim will pick his first Man Utd team on Sunday and while the fixture at Ipswich might come too soon for Mason Mount, he will get a chance to impress the new boss.\n\nIt is unusual for Manchester United to release such in-depth footage of training as they did on Monday, showing plenty of action from Ruben Amorim's first day on the grass at Carrington.\n\nThe seven-minute clip showed Amorim arranging the players available to him in his favoured 3-4-3 shape, and it's been pored over relentlessly since to decipher any clues as to what he may or may not do.\n\nIt was clear that the 39-year-old was at the heart of the action at Carrington, taking on a hands-on role in a high-intensity session. There was also praise for one player who could be well-suited to Amorim's demands but has hardly a mention in the chat about the players or might or might not win favour with the former Sporting boss.\n\nIn one clip, Mason Mount latches on to a Tyrell Malacia pass, and you can hear Amorim shout, \"Good movement, Mase\" across the pitch. In the following clip it is Mount himself scoring from another attack. After each one ends in a goal, Amorim is seen looking at his watch and demanding his players get going again.\n\nHe wants his team to play with an intensity and aggression that wasn't always evident at United under Erik ten Hag. Mount can deliver these characteristics, however, and he was impressive at the very start of this season, pressing on the front foot and showing an energy that really added something to the team's play.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a familiar story when Mount picked up an injury at Brighton. After a brief comeback in September, he returned to the treatment table before coming on against PAOK earlier in November.\n\nThe 25-year-old is now back fit and back in full training and already impressing Amorim. It remains to be seen whether Mount has done enough to start for the first time in three months when United face Ipswich this weekend, but at the very least, he will be an option off the bench.\n\nMount must make up for lost time in his Old Trafford career. He was signed for £55m in the summer of 2023, with a further £5m in add-ons, and was earmarked to be the connector in Erik ten Hag's midfield three. He didn't stay fit enough for long enough to make that spot his own, and Kobbie Mainoo's emergence dropped Mount down the pecking order.\n\nThere is a feeling that the former Chelsea midfielder is better closer to goal, and under Amorim, he might find it hard to challenge for either of the two deeper midfield slots, which could be a battle between Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, but the Portuguese coach does often pick two No. 10s, and that could well be Mount's best position.\n\nIn Ten Hag's 4-3-3, Mount had no chance of displacing Bruno Fernandes, but now there could be room for both of them to play a central, creative role behind a striker. That's an opportunity Mount can't afford to waste.\n\nHe will face competition for that role, probably from the cast of wingers who might look to operate there now, such as Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Amad. It will be fascinating to see how Amorim fits enough attacking talent onto the pitch to make a difference.\n\nBut you can see why he would like someone like Mount. At his best, he is a coach's dream, and there is a reason so many coaches have loved working with him. One of them was Thomas Tuchel, soon to take over as England head coach. With a fresh start on offer at club level as well, it's a big few months ahead for Mount.",

        "headline": "Neymar fires savage five-word dig at Rodri after Ballon d'Or winner sends 'pay attention' warning to Vinicius Jr",
        "article_text": "Manchester City midfielder Rodri has given his honest thoughts about Ballon d’Or rival Vinicius Junior - but Neymar is not happy with his comments. Rodri, 28, was awarded the coveted prize on Monday, 28 October, at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. This was after Real Madrid star Vini Jr, 24, had also been tipped to secure the award, which is widely regarded as the award for being the best player in the world. As a result of missing out, the Spanish side did not travel to the French capital for the occasion despite striker Kylian Mbappe sharing the Gerd Muller Trophy with Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane. Madrid were also crowned 'Club of the year' but this was still not enough to make them attend the star-studded awards ceremony. Quickly after Rodri's name was announced, Vini tweeted: \"I'll do it 10 times if I have to. They're not ready.\" Rodri has been out of action since sustaining a knee ligament injury in a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on September 22. Now, the Spanish midfielder has finally spoke out about the Ballon d’Or debacle. \"I think he’s a smart guy and with time you’ll realize that the more you pay attention on the field, the better he [Vini Jr] will be,\" Rodri told Spanish TV programme El Largeuro. \"Athletes are not just what you represent on the field, but also off it.\" But it was Vini Jr's Brazil teammate Neymar who could not help but give his thoughts on Rodri's words with a five-word dig in the comment section of Futeousadia's Instagram post. The Al Hilal man commented: \"Virou falador agora (he becomes a talker now - in English).\" Neymar previously referred to the Real Madrid man as a \"great idol\" and \"hero\" for the people of Brazil even explaining how he didn't \"think there's anyone but him [Vini Jr] to win it [Ballon d'Or]\" when speaking to SNTV in October. The former Barcelona man has also never won the Ballon d’Or despite arguably being one of the best players over the last 15 years.",

        "headline": "Pep Guardiola makes huge claim about Man City's 115 charges and rival fans won't be happy",
        "article_text": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken out about the club's 115 financial fair play charges just one day after signing a two-year extension on his deal.\n\nAfter a two week international break, the Premier League is back in action on Saturday with several exciting clashes including a match between defending champions City and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nJust days before the match, City fans were treated to the news that legendary manager Guardiola had signed a new deal with the club, extending his stay there until the summer of 2027.\n\nHaving signed the new deal, Guardiola has now spoken out again about City's 115 charges regarding breaches of the Premier League's FFP rules, and his comments are not going to sit well with rival fans.\n\nAt the start of the season, the Catalan manager claimed that he would stand by the club even if they were found guilty of the 115 charges and relegated to a lower tier of the English football ladder.\n\nAnd now, much to the dismay of rivals hoping he would leave City in the near future, he has doubled down on his promise.\n\nSpeaking ahead of City's clash with Tottenham this weekend, Guardiola said: \"I said six months ago, when all the clubs accused us of doing something wrong, and was asked what happened if we are relegated. I will be here.\n\n\"Next year, if we are in the Conference we will come up to the Premier League. I knew it then and I feel it now.\n\n\"I signed a two-year contract... for the weather! I don't want next season in September, October or November for it to be all about, 'It's the last year of Pep'. I don't want to be in that position.\"\n\nHowever, the five-time Premier League winner admitted that if results for City turned for the worst, then he would consider leaving the club and pursuing a career elsewhere.\n\n\"I would like to stay for the two years but I know if the results are not good it will not be two years,\" added Guardiola.\n\nSo far in the 2024/25 Premier League season, City have struggled to match the standard set by themselves in previous seasons, as they continue to miss midfield star Rodri who suffered a season-ending injury in September.",

        "article_text": "Manchester United’s Carrington Training Centre has played host to some of the best footballers of all time – but it would be turned into something entirely different if a war was to happen.\n\nCarrington replaced United’s ‘The Cliff’ training ground in the year 2000.\n\nSince opening its doors, the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney have used its facilities – whether that be the carpet-like training pitches, gym facilities or boot rooms.\n\nAlthough Ronaldo may not entirely approve of the facilities, which he made clear in his 2022 interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, the training ground is one of the most iconic in the Premier League.\n\nFormer United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, 82, previously revealed that there was a bizarre clause written into the contract to buy the land. This included ‘untouched’ areas for Canada Geese as well as an odd scenario involving a potato farm.\n\n\"The Cliff was great when I first came, but then the club grew,” he told the UTD Podcast in September 2021.\n\n\"We had to put an extension in the indoor place for the boys to dress because we had no space in the actual building. \"So, then I started to wander around Manchester looking for a piece of ground that we could build a new training ground on.\n\n\"We’re hunting everywhere, in North Manchester in particular.”\n\nThe Scot then explained how former chief scout and academy director Les Kershaw approached him with a friend from Shell. \"He said ‘Shell are trying to sell some of their ground over at Carrington’,... so we went to see.\n\n\"The size of the land we were getting, I think it was 28 acres or something, but there were restrictions which I can’t understand today.\"\n\n\"Part of the restrictions were, in the event of war, we had to turn the ground into potato fields,” Ferguson explained.\n\n\"And, up at the very end, there had to be an acre or two acres for Canadian geese.”\n\nThe 13-time Premier League-winning manager then revealed how he returned to Old Trafford during Louis van Gaal’s tenure as manager only to find that the Dutchman had put stands and floodlights up around the venue.",

        "article_text": "Ally McCoist has opened up on living with Dupuytren’s contracture; an incurable condition that causes his fingers to bend towards his palms.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Rangers striker, who recently received an OBE for services to football and broadcasting, is arguably one of the most popular pundits in the game through his work with Amazon Prime, TNT Sports and ITV.\n\nHe is also a regular on radio station talkSPORT and this week, McCoist revealed that he is suffering from an incurable condition that impacts his everyday life.\n\nDupuytren's contracture, also known as Viking disease, is an abnormal thickening of the skin in the palm of the hand which can cause the fingers to curl towards the palm or pull sideways.\n\nIt has been given the name Viking disease due to its prevalence in the north of Europe and those of Northern European descent.\n\nAccording to tradition, the condition was common among the Vikings after the disease was spread among the populations they intermarried with.\n\nThere is currently no cure, but your fingers can be straightened with surgery if it's severe.\n\nMcCoist has gone under the knife on two separate occasions but as he revealed on talkSPORT, the condition came back several years later.\n\nHe explained: \"I have got Dupuytren's. It's a hereditary thing where your fingers close in.\n\n\"I have had them done twice. I went to see the doctor and he said to me 'Did your grandfather have it?'. I said 'I don't know' because I never met any of my grandfathers, sadly they passed before I was born.\n\n\"I said to him 'But my dad had it'. He lifted his head up and said 'You're unlucky because it normally skips a generation'. I said 'That's good news because I have got five boys'.\n\n\"My wee mum had it as well. My mum had it, my dad had it, it's a hereditary thing.\"\n\nMcCoist continued: \"The bizarre thing with Dupuytren's is when I went to see the doctor he said 'I will operate on it but it will come back in roughly nine years'. And I swear to God nine years later it came back.\n\n\"I have seen myself sending a text message which takes me five minutes to text with one finger when I should just dial the number.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers and it is common to have it in both hands at the same time. It's not usually painful, but it can affect how you use your hand.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to having a family history of the condition, smoking, and having diabetes or epilepsy.",

However, Martyn Ziegler of The Times reported that City were not successful and that the amendments have been approved.\n\nOn Friday morning, the journalist took to X and wrote: \"Breaking: Premier League clubs vote through associated party rule amendments - defeat for Manchester City.\"\n\nOn Thursday The Times reported that both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Everton were set to perform a u-turn and back the Premier League after previously voting against tougher APT rules a year ago.\n\nSeven clubs were required in order for a veto to happen and though Aston Villa were reported to have sided with City, the outcome of a shareholders' meeting in London means the changes will happen as planned.\n\nThe main purpose of the APT rules is to stop clubs inflating commercial deals while maintaining the competitiveness of the Premier League. City challenged the regulations and said \"the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside\", leading to the Premier League consulting with clubs with a 14-page document.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, the vote was 16 votes for and four against - with City joined by Nottingham Forest, Villa and Newcastle United but ultimately being outnumbered.\n\n“The amendments to the rules address the findings of an Arbitration Tribunal following a legal challenge by Manchester City to the APT system earlier this year,\" a statement from the Premier League read.\n\n“The Premier League has conducted a detailed consultation with clubs - informed by multiple opinions from expert, independent Leading Counsel - to draft rule changes that address amendments required to the system.\n\n\"This relates to integrating the assessment of Shareholder loans, the removal of some of the amendments made to APT rules earlier this year and changes to the process by which relevant information from the League’s ‘databank’ is shared with a club’s advisors.\n\n\"The purpose of the APT rules is to ensure clubs are not able to benefit from commercial deals or reductions in costs that are not at Fair Market Value (FMV) by virtue of relationships with Associated Parties.

        "article_text": "Former Liverpool CEO Peter Moore has revealed what he knows about the discussions regarding Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk’s contracts.\n\nMoore, 69, was the Reds’ CEO between 2017 and 2020, and his work coincided with Jurgen Klopp’s Champions League and Premier League winning success – in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nSeveral of the players involved in the triumphs are still at the club, with Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Van Dijk’s futures still unclear.\n\nAll three players are set to see their contracts expire at the end of the season, with Moore’s fellow Liverpudlian Alexander-Arnold heavily linked with a move to La Liga outfit Real Madrid, with fans giving their thoughts on the situation earlier this week.\n\nThe former Liverpool chief was no stranger to dealing with these types of situations during his tenure at Anfield, and he explained what he knew about the situation.\n\n“I don't know what's going to happen [with the contracts],” he told Soccerex in Miami [via Liverpool Echo].\n\n“If it's Trent [Alexander-Arnold], it's Virgil [van Dijk], it's Mo [Salah]. It's hard to imagine any of those leaving Liverpool. Ownership, I know, is working feverishly to get deals done, whether it is all three, two of the three, one of the three or none of the three.\n\n“I don't know, but you look at those players, and what you do like is that they all seem very dedicated right now. There is no - particularly with those three - taking a game off for some reason.\n\n“Even in Trent's case, they are the senior citizens. You think about what they offer, and come January, in particular in Trent's case, we will see what happens. But I know ownership is talking with their respective agents - I'm sure feverishly.”\n\nIn October, Van Dijk admitted that discussions between his representatives and the football club were ongoing but also explained how he had “no idea” what the future holds when speaking to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Salah, he has previously been the subject of a £150m bid from Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad, which Liverpool rejected in August of 2023.\n\nAll three players will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs when the transfer window opens on January 1 2025.",

        "headline": "‘He’s ready’: Ruben Amorim’s rapid rise from obscurity to Premier League",
        "article_text": "Before Portuguese’s first Manchester United game, the people who know him well explain how he got this far\n\nThe road from the Portuguese third tier to Portman Road is a unique journey and one that will take Ruben Amorim from relative obscurity to one of the most-scrutinised coaching roles in the world. Amorim felt forced to quit his first coaching job at Casa Pia after being sanctioned for not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications less than six years ago, but has rapidly risen to become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe.\n\nThe Estádio Pina Manique is on the outskirts of Lisbon, Amorim’s home town and where he has spent most of his playing and managerial career. The venue holds about 2,500 spectators, a long way from the 30,000 or so expected to be in attendance for Amorim’s first match as Manchester United manager at Ipswich on Sunday.\n\nAmorim’s spell at Casa Pia lasted six months, and was curtailed when he and the club were punished after he gave instructions from the sidelines despite lacking the relevant qualifications. He was there for a short time, but had a huge effect on those who worked with him.\n\n“When he said in front of the group he was leaving, I saw 10, 12 teammates crying,” says the former Casa Pisa forward José Embaló. “I went to shake his hand and hug him, and he said: ‘I’m so sorry but keep working. You never know what life is waiting for you.’”\n\nIt was the first job where Amorim implemented the 3-4-3 formation that has been the foundation for his success ever since. The foundations of his staff also began there, with the youthful Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes starting their careers alongside him at Casa Pisa.\n\n“Adélio [Cândido] and Carlos Fernandes, they were very loyal to him,” says Embaló. “They have so much talent to be a top coach. I was 25, while Adélio and Carlos Fernandes were 22, 23. But their minds were so big on football that I learned a lot from them. I really appreciate the way they see football – they showed me age doesn’t matter.”\n\nAmorim’s 13-year playing career had ended two years earlier and he spent the intervening period preparing for how he would approach coaching, including his man-management style. At 33, he was dealing with some players who were older than him and many that were not much younger, but none who had reached the heights he did as a midfielder at Benfica.\n\n“He’s part of the family, he treats you with all the respect,” Embaló says. “At that time, to see him as an older brother who knows a lot of football and the love you see in his eyes, the love he has for football.\n\n“He benched me for a game, so inside I would get so angry. But I didn’t show him. He called me to one side, and he said: ‘Look, José, I know your feelings, but that doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about that, I really need you in this game, but coming from the bench.’ That was a change. I started to appreciate him more. He made me feel that when I was on the bench, I was more important than who was starting.”\n\nEmbaló has played in 10 countries, but Amorim left a lasting impression on him. “As a player, when you see the person first and then you see a coach. You just appreciate the time you have together and enjoy,” says the 31-year-old. “I used to go to training and after I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to go home, rest and wait for the next day to go training because it was so enjoyable.”\n\nAt Casa Pia, Amorim came up against Pedro Russiano, an old friend from his Benfica academy days. The duo were teammates throughout the age groups when Amorim got his first taste of elite coaching under the guidance of José Mourinho’s former assistant, José Morais.\n\n“Sometimes he [Morais] put Ruben right-back or central defender or midfielder, defensive midfielder or No 8 or No 10, and he always knew how to play in this position,” Russiano says. “He knew how to play every position and I think it helped him become a smart coach because he was always an intelligent player on the pitch and it’s very important for our intelligence as coaches.”\n\nWhen Russiano’s Amora met Casa Pia, the latter succumbed to a 1-0 defeat. “The secret to winning 1-0 was to put pressure on the three defenders because he [Amorim] didn’t have Viktor Gyökeres back then,” Russiano says. “It was the same system, the same dynamics as Sporting. The difference is the depth. He creates more depth with Gyökeres. The evolution of his tactics and teams is this player. He has always had the same tactic, but the players have got better.”\n\nIt was a springboard that took Amorim to Braga B then the first team, creating an upward trajectory that lasted throughout his time with Sporting and which will now be tested at United. Amorim has evolved as a coach, tweaking the system he first used at Casa Pia, and he continues to innovate.\n\n“I don’t know if he will be a success in Manchester, but he arrives at United with them down, like it was when he moved to Sporting,” says Russiano. “This is a special thing why Ruben takes Manchester United. He’s ready for this.",

Can we get some assistance?’” Lawson said.\n\n“We turned around and Bruno was there and a gentleman looked like he was passing out and Bruno had caught him.

Bruno stayed with him, for, I think – I lost track of time – five or 10 minutes.”\n\nLawson confirmed the unwell man was “absolutely fine”, managing to stand up and walk back through the plane, and she commended the midfielder for his composure during the incident. “What an absolutely lovely man. He did it and didn’t make a big deal out of it. [The air stewards] just called for help and help came.”\n\nShortly after landing in Portugal, Lawson met Fernandes and his Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, who was also on the plane, and thanked the player for helping the unwell passenger.\n\n“I basically said to Bruno: ‘What you did back there was really lovely, it was great that you were there to be able to help’,” she said. “The ridiculous thing is we’re a blue family – we support Manchester City.”",

        "headline": "Ten talking points from the weekend football",
        "article_text": "Ipswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n--------------------------------\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer.\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. \n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler.\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was hesitant to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be executed by the current squad. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, revealing he is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt.\n\n6\n\nIpswich's young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap’s values are shooting up by the week as they have set themselves fair for the future.\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman Ivan Toney in the summer but have shown impressive attacking prowess without him. However, their rotten away form is a concern, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road.\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, the situation with José Sá calling for medical attention demonstrated how the game can be slowed down unfairly, resulting in further instructions from the coach.\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nCrysencio Summerville is beginning to make his mark at West Ham, standing out as West Ham’s most consistent threat against Everton and offering hope in a struggling squad.\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nHarry Wilson’s third goal of the week from the bench raises the question of what he needs to do to start for Fulham, demonstrating his competition for a starting spot is fierce.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim is yet to be granted a visa despite starting his first official day as Manchester United’s head coach on Monday and will not be able to take an opening training session.\n\nThe 39-year-old Portuguese will travel to the club on Monday to begin his tenure but, while United expect the visa to be granted soon, it is unclear what duties Amorim can undertake until this occurs.\n\nWith many United players away on international duty the wait for a visa should not materially affect Amorim’s plans, as his ability to work with the full squad was always limited to starting on Thursday week, when all are expected back from matches with their respective international teams. Amorim signed off from Sporting on Sunday evening with a 4-2 win away at Braga, coming back from 2-0 down at half-time. He departs the Portuguese champions with a perfect record of 11 wins from 11 games in the Primeira Liga this season.\n\nSpeaking after the win, Amorim turned his attentions to his new job. “It’s going to be difficult, I’m not under any illusions,” he said. “I feel ready for the new challenge. I’m not naive, I know it’s going to be very different, very difficult. I’m at peace now, I can focus on my new job and I’m looking forward to starting tomorrow.”\n\nAmorim is the sixth permanent successor to Sir Alex Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, and takes over a team unbeaten in the last four under the caretaker manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, after Erik ten Hag’s dismissal. Van Nistelrooy ended his tenure unbeaten, with three victories, the last of which was Sunday’s 3-0 win over Leicester at Old Trafford.\n\nWhether Van Nistelrooy has a future under Amorim is yet to be determined. “We will learn what the further plan is now,” he said. “I am here to support the club and I want to continue that. I was told after this block of four matches, there will be communication towards you and your colleagues [about the future], so I expect to hear today [Sunday] or tomorrow [Monday].”\n\nBruno Fernandes, who scored United’s opener against Leicester, said: “Ruud van Nistelrooy feels the club, he loves the club, he wants to bring joy to the players. He brought everyone with a smile to the games, he just wanted us to enjoy it. We wanted to say goodbye as a manager for him properly because he did good things for us.”\n\nOf Amorim, Fernandes said: “It’s a new era, a new manager means everything changes but what hasn’t changed is that this club has to get back to where it belongs.”\n\nSteve Cooper gave injury updates on the missing Jamie Vardy and Ricardo Pereira. “Jamie is a bit inconclusive, he picked up a knock to his back last week and hasn’t been able to shake it off. We are still trying to work it out,” the Leicester manager said. “Ricky is a more serious hamstring injury and is going to be ruled out for four months so that is a blow for him.",

        "headline": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester",
        "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes sparks Manchester United to easy victory over Leicester\n\nEleven days after Manchester United routed Leicester under Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Carabao Cup here, the interim manager signed off with another easy-street win over the Foxes and so ends his four-game term unbeaten.\n\nIn all the Dutchman has three victories, and for this one he could thank Bruno Fernandes, who graced a 250th United appearance by scoring the first goal and causing enough trouble for the hapless Victor Kristiansen to bundle past his goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, for the second.\n\nFernandes’s goal was a fourth of Van Nistelrooy’s brief reign after zero for Erik ten Hag in the captain’s previous 17 outings, a run that stretched back to April. Ten Hag has been replaced by Rúben Amorim, whose opening day as the new head coach is due to be on Monday, as United hope their latest reset is finally the right one.\n\nFernandes said: “It was a long time that I wasn’t scoring and now goals are coming in the last few games.”\n\nIn an unsurprising move, Van Nistelrooy’s one change from the XI that drew with Chelsea last Sunday was finding a place for the explosive aggression of Amad Diallo – Alejandro Garnacho was the fall guy – and his thrust had the visitors on their heels throughout.\n\nOne dart swept the 22-year-old deep into Leicester territory and provoked Abdul Fatawu into upending him. Fernandes targeted Casemiro with the free-kick but the visitors cleared.\n\nUnited hemmed Leicester in. Any forays were on the counter, as when Fatawu mugged Casemiro and the ball went to Wilfred Ndidi, but the home team escaped.\n\nThe first of Diallo’s double in Thursday’s 2-0 Europa League victory over Paok was a craftily looped header, and here United attempted a repeat. Marcus Rashford dropped the ball in from the left towards the far post where Diallo lurked, but Kristiansen headed out.\n\nThe Leicester defender was to have a shocker for Fernandes’s opener. With his side on the attack, a long United clearance caused Kristiansen to hesitate: fatal if Diallo is closing down. He was, he took the ball, and made a turbo-charged run on goal. The ball went for a throw-in and, again, Diallo starred. Noussair Mazraoui found Fernandes, who rolled the ball to Diallo. By appearing casual the Ivorian duped Steve Cooper’s team and allowed a moment of brilliance: the backheeled return to Fernandes, who skipped forward and fashioned a peach of a curler that defeated Hermansen into his bottom left corner.\n\nUnited were in raptures, the goalkeeper furious at those slumbering in front of him – understandably. These emotions soon nearly tilted. Ndidi was not tracked as he ran in behind, Facundo Buonanotte chipped over, but the midfielder failed to beat André Onana at close range.\n\nCue a Van Nistelrooy fit at the lack of a runner with Ndidi. Yet overall United were akin to a boxer ahead on points keeping the opposing pugilist at arm’s length with their jab: of this, Harry Winks’ hit-and-hope effort was emblematic.\n\nBut the gaps in midfield remained in quick transition and so Winks’ lob into Buonanotte left United scrambling and Mazraoui appearing to take him down. This occurred on the borderline of the area but Peter Bankes gave neither penalty or free-kick, the referee invoking the travelling faithful’s ire.\n\nA far more sour pill was theirs to swallow next, in what was a calamity of errors from those in blue. Mazraoui’s flighted delivery was missed comically by both Jannik Vestergaard and Wout Faes, and Kristiansen’s nightmare continued as the ball glanced off the marauding Fernandes’ thigh and pinged in off the defender for an own goal and 2-0. The half ended with Diallo – who else? – burning a hole through Leicester and shooting, though the sharp Hermansen beat his effort away.\n\nCould United close this out? Being unable to seal the deal has been one of their major faults. Manuel Ugarte was a fire-dousing dynamo who did his best to ensure they did so. A chop of Buonanotte that gave a free-kick near United’s D was due to this enthusiasm but the hash Leicester made of the dead ball let him off the hook.\n\nOn 57 minutes Van Nistelrooy removed a disappointing Rashford for Garnacho and Diogo Dalot for Jonny Evans (perhaps for a knock), Lisandro Martínez moving to left-back and Mazraoui to right-back.\n\nAfter a clip on the ankle that needed treatment, Martínez fed Garnacho but he muddled down a cul-de-sac near the left corner flag and James Justin mopped up. The winger did the precise same thing after a glorious left-footed 40-yard Ugarte parabola took him clear. As Garnacho reached the area, a cutback on Faes failed, and he fell over.\n\nBut the 20-year-old laughed last and loudest thanks to a seventh goal of the campaign created by Fernandes’s curving pass and finished by an arrow from the winger that allowed Hermansen scant chance.\n\nHis celebration was muted. Fernandes said: “Garnacho scored a banger but didn’t celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him: ‘People will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.’”",

        "headline": "Ten things to look out for this weekend",
        "article_text": "Lucas Paquetá is struggling, Ruud van Nistelrooy nears Old Trafford farewell and will Luis Díaz play as a striker again?\n\n1\n\nBees susceptible to constant crosses\n------------------------------------\n\nBrentford have scored nine and conceded six in their past two Premier League home games. Their leaky defence did not cost them in victories over Wolves and Ipswich but they were shown up by Harry Wilson’s injury-time double on Monday night at Fulham to suggest things need to improve at the back. Wilson’s goals both came from crosses. Brentford allowed Fulham to cross the ball 43 times, although Thomas Frank was not too worried about it and was surprisingly relaxed that they led to two goals. With Ethan Pinnock and Nathan Collins, he does have centre-backs capable of dealing with the majority but it is a dangerous game to play. Bournemouth will have taken note and their fine wingers and full-backs will probably target the space afforded out wide.\n\n2\n\nKamada the main man with Eze sidelined\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe news that Eddie Nketiah is set for a spell on the sidelines after picking up a hamstring injury in training this week may have given Oliver Glasner less of a headache over whether to prefer the £30m signing to his main striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, but the the Crystal Palace manager goes into Saturday’s crucial home game against Fulham short of firepower, with only three fit forwards to choose from. With Eberechi Eze still out with his own hamstring problem, the responsibility to provide creativity could fall on the shoulders of Daichi Kamada after he scored the winner in the League Cup win over Aston Villa last week. The Japan forward – the club’s highest-paid player – has taken time to settle in London despite playing under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt but appears to have found his form in the last two matches.\n\n3\n\nPaquetá has badly gone off the boil\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt is not a coincidence that West Ham improved after taking off Lucas Paquetá at half-time during their win over Manchester United two weeks ago. The Brazilian’s decline has been dramatic, albeit not too surprising. Paquetá, once a target for Manchester City, has been charged with a breach of the Football Association’s betting regulations and is at risk of a lengthy ban. Playing under those conditions cannot be easy and the midfielder has often looked unfocused this season. Yet West Ham need Paquetá performing. He remains West Ham’s most creative talent and must step up for the visit of Everton – assuming, that is, he keeps his spot in Julen Lopetegui’s starting XI.\n\n4\n\nFernandes gives Saints a sporting chance\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith each passing week the signing of Mateus Fernandes looks increasingly good business for Southampton, particularly the decision to tie him to a five-year contract on his arrival in August. The fleet-footed central midfielder who played under Rúben Amorim at Sporting distributes the ball sensibly and has an impressive engine, evidenced by a crucial role linking defence and attack in last Saturday’s precious victory over Everton. “Top talent, but nowhere near ready to play for anyone else. He needs a good couple of years here for us first,” quipped Russell Martin of the 20-year-old’s form, which will doubtless attract attention from elsewhere. Aaron Ramsdale was also outstanding in goal for Southampton last weekend. Nineteenth meets 20th at Molineux and rock-bottom Wolves are naturally desperate for a win: their finishing will need to be calm and clinical.\n\n5\n\nBrighton look to capitalise on City’s slump\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBrighton’s record against Manchester City does not make happy reading. Not since a 3-2 victory at the end of the 2020-21 season have they tasted victory over Pep Guardiola’s side, when Dan Burn scored to cap a famous comeback victory from two goals down and end City’s winning 12-match away run. Fabian Hürzeler will have his first opportunity to take the biggest scalp in the top flight after failing to get anything out of their back-to-back games against Liverpool in the League Cup and the Premier League. The 31-year-old will fancy his side’s chances against a City side that have suffered three successive defeats in all competitions. Brighton’s array of attacking threats should make it a testing afternoon for the visitors.\n\n6\n\nDíaz to continue as a central striker?\n--------------------------------------\n\nUnai Emery must hope Aston Villa learn fast from their collapse at Tottenham last week given Liverpool’s considerable and decisive second-half improvements against Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton. Arne Slot’s deployment of Luis Díaz as a central striker against Leverkusen proved a resounding success with the Colombian registering the first hat-trick of his Liverpool career. The decision was shaped by the absences of Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa (both of whom are likely to miss out again on Saturday), Darwin Núñez’s recent workload and Díaz’s ability to unsettle the Leverkusen central defender Jonathan Tah with runs in behind. The temptation to leave Díaz up top will be strong, given the 27-year-old scored more goals in one night than Núñez has delivered all season.\n\n7\n\nVan Nistelrooy nears Old Trafford farewell\n------------------------------------------\n\nManchester United’s game against Leicester serves as a farewell to Ruud van Nistelrooy – this being the last of his four-match interim manager spell – and the start, 24 hours afterwards, of Rúben Amorim’s tenure as the new permanent manager. Van Nistelrooy has stated on more than one occasion he wishes to stay on in some capacity under the Portuguese but it remains unclear how valuable a win over Leicester would be to his continued employment at Old Trafford. A fourth league victory of this troubled campaign for United would certainly help, against visitors who arrive on 10 points, just two points and two places below their hosts.\n\n8\n\nWood burning to turn up heat on Howe\n------------------------------------\n\nIt seems foolish to think that things can get much better for Forest. They head into the weekend sitting third in the table, a whopping eight places above Newcastle. One of the key factors in Forest’s success is the impressive form of Chris Wood; no one would have expected him to have eight goals in 10 games but the New Zealand striker has been clinical. After a slow start to his Forest career since joining from Sunday’s visitors, Nuno Espírito Santo is helping Wood flourish by constantly having wingers who know where to find the man in the middle of the box. Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi are exciting and effective, while Jota Silva and Ramón Sosa come off the bench to keep things fresh. Wood will be extremely eager to show Newcastle what happens when a team plays to his strength, having scored four in 35 league appearances for the club before being sold on. Wood hit a hat-trick at St James’ Park last season, so knows how to hurt them.\n\n9\n\nCajuste ready to take reins from Phillips\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAfter two straight 4-1 home victories, Ange Postecoglou welcomes the league’s second worst defence to north London. Kieran McKenna will need something akin to a cunning plan if Ipswich are to secure a first victory of the season on Sunday. The manager will have a decision to make over who to combine in midfield after Kalvin Phillips was dismissed in the draw against Leicester. Jens Cajuste is the obvious choice to replace the Manchester City loanee and sit alongside Sam Morsy. The Swede has started twice and made the same amount of appearances off the bench in the league since arriving for the season from Napoli. Having made 71 career starts and 56 outings as a substitute across four clubs, he will be desperate to get a run in the team under McKenna. Cajuste has shown brief promise and Phillips is yet to indicate a return to his best, so this is a fine opportunity for the 25-year-old to prove he can be relied upon.\n\n10\n\nChelsea players must step up if Palmer is out\n---------------------------------------------\n\nChelsea may get another opportunity to prove they are not Cole Palmer FC this weekend. It was Mauricio Pochettino who coined the phrase, doing so when the best creative player in England was absent for the trip to Arsenal last April. Pochettino wanted his players to shine without Palmer, but the ploy was unsuccessful. Chelsea were humiliated in a 5-0 defeat and will hope they fare better if Palmer is absent when Arsenal visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. The England international was fortunate to escape serious injury after being chopped down by United’s Lisandro Martínez last Sunday and has not trained fully this week. He is a doubt and Pochettino’s replacement, Enzo Maresca, could need Chelsea’s other attacking midfielders to take on more responsibility. Although Maresca has plenty of options, so much goes through Palmer.",

        "article_text": "Van Nistelrooy revealed he is yet to hear from Rúben Amorim regarding his future after Manchester United finally ended a wait of more than a year for a European win.\n\nUnited’s victory over the Greek champions, Paok, at Old Trafford lifted them to 15th in the Europa League table with six points. Sunday’s visit of Leicester will be Van Nistelrooy’s fourth and final match as United’s interim manager. Whether he remains at the club under Amorim is yet to be determined, and after Thursday’s win the Dutchman said he had received no contact from the 39-year-old, who takes over on Monday after Sporting’s trip to Braga on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve got to check my phone now to see if Amorim has messaged – we’ll see later. I think that Rúben is focusing on Braga and I focus on Leicester,” said Van Nistelrooy. “That’s it for now and it shows we are focused on the day-by-day job. Let him focus on Braga and I focus on Leicester and we’ll see after that. I’m only busy with one thing in my mind.\n\n“I want for my last game as an interim to prepare the best I can and give the players everything. That is my absolute focus and other than that I don’t look too far ahead. It’s too important.”\n\nUnited’s victory came via two second-half Amad Diallo goals, the winger the contest’s standout player. It means Van Nistelrooy has overseen two wins and a draw since Erik ten Hag was sacked last Monday after defeat at West Ham.\n\n“This short spell is an important period to react since we lost to West Ham,” he said. “We needed to start getting results and that’s why I said it was important. For me, it is important to carry on and build on the results of Leicester, Chelsea, and Paok. We can build on a first European home win in one year. We addressed that in the dressing room; it was time to change that and we did that. Sunday is a big game for us in the league and we need to put in a big performance.\n\n“The first half against Paok wasn’t good. We hardly created anything, and Paok neither. We didn’t get going, and our possession wasn’t good enough, and we made a lot of technical mistakes. Our shape wasn’t good; it was at times, but not long enough in the shape we wanted to play. The second half was a lot better.",

        "headline": "Amad Diallo ends Manchester United’s European drought by seeing off Paok",
        "article_text": "Hold on to your hat: Manchester United are victorious in Europe after three consecutive Europa League draws and three more games without winning in last season’s Champions League.\n\nSo a 380-day drought stretching to a 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford ends courtesy of Amad Diallo, whose explosive wing play was crowned by his double. The first was a clever 50th-minute header. The second an exhibition of aggressiveness as he mugged Abdul Baba along the right, shrugged off the defender’s manhandling, then fired a shot into the left corner, via a deflection.\n\nAs Ruud van Nistelrooy, United’s interim manager, said: “The second goal had everything in it that for me is Amad Diallo. He fought to take the ball off the Paok defender, pushed through to get the shot, and had the quality to curl it round the goalkeeper.”\n\nUnited’s results in continental competition this season were 1-1 against Twente, 3-3 at Porto and 1-1 at Fenerbahce. Hardly a roll of honour and when Van Nistelrooy rotated Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt for Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelöf in central defence, and Diallo for Marcus Rashford in attack, you wondered whether three points would finally be garnered.\n\nThe first half suggested not. Razvan Lucescu configured his Greek champions in a 4-2-3-1 that was a carbon copy of Van Nistelrooy’s shape and Mady Camara, the visiting No 10, exposed a familiar faultline when running into a gap, passing, collecting later in the move, then shooting.\n\nDiallo jinked about infield, fed Noussair Mazraoui, who switched the ball back into space on the right. This invited Casemiro to run on and hit an instant delivery to the far post where Alejandro Garnacho headed against Jonny’s arm, but a corner rather than penalty was the decision. The referee – and VAR – made the same call later when Diallo went down under Baba’s challenge.\n\nDiallo was United’s bright light. His next act was to drop the ball on to Rasmus Højlund’s head but, twisting, the centre-forward’s header was insipid. A 65% possession rate showed the home team’s dominance. As usual, the problem was execution in the final third. Earlier, Garnacho fluffed a regulation pass to an overlapping colleague in Paok’s area. Now he offered a repeat.\n\nAs they headed for the break – nearly behind due to a Camara rocket that burned Onana’s fingertips when deflecting over – toothless was the report on United’s opening 45 minutes. Van Nistelrooy, a ruthless assassin when United’s striker, needed to address this when his troops trailed off for the interval refreshments.\n\nYet more of the same followed. Garnacho did manage to locate Dalot on the overlap this time but the latter failed to find Fernandes as he arrived in Paok’s area. Fernandes showed the defender how it is done, as United discovered ruthlessness at last. Along the left, Garnacho glanced up and tapped to his captain who chipped in a precise ball that had the excellent Diallo leaping and looping a header back across goal which wrongfooted Dominik Kotarski, the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nUnited were serving up another smorgasbord of chances, but too many were spurned. Soon after Diallo’s second he hurt his leg and was replaced despite appearing to be fine. United will hope so ahead of Sunday’s visit of Leicester.",

        "headline": "Onana claims Manchester United will ‘step up’ for arrival of Ruben Amorim",
        "article_text": "André Onana has backed his Manchester United teammates to “step up” and adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style after watching Sporting defeat Manchester City 4-1 in the Champions League. Amorim, who will arrive in England next week to replace Erik ten Hag, prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.\n\n“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s Europa League game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them [Sporting], by the way. Different system, but the ­players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”\n\nUnited have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester and a league draw against Chelsea but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim, who will take charge of one more Sporting game on Sunday, about the team or his future.\n\nOnana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”\n\nOne player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”\n\nUnited have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.",

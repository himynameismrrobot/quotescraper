The Portuguese's options in defence have been limited due to injuries since his arrival, though he revealed he could welcome back some of his injured stars this weekend.\n\n\"Maybe, we have to see,\" he said when asked if any players could return on Sunday. \"We have one more training, if not in the starting XI then they will be on the bench.\"",

United sit 13th and 12th in the Premier League and European standings respectively.\n\nOn Sunday, they welcome Merseyside club Everton to Old Trafford at an earlier time of 1:30pm. Typically, the two Sunday slots for the Premier League are the later times of 2pm and 4:30pm.\n\nWhile an official reason hasn't been given for the change to the earlier kick-off times, in which Chelsea vs Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham also take place at 1:30pm, it is most likely due to the Liverpool vs Manchester City clash taking place at 4pm instead of 4:30pm.\n\nThe MEN has previously reported the decision was made at the request of Merseyside Police in light of supporter trouble in previous meetings between the two teams. Therefore, the earlier games have likely been moved to avoid any crossover of TV coverage, with Chelsea's game against Villa also set to be broadcast on Sky Sports.\n\nAmorim will hope his side can gain some ground in the top four chase with a victory over Everton this weekend as they will then travel to face title chasers Arsenal midweek in the Premier League. City meanwhile are desperate to address their slump after they went six games without a win following an unbelievable draw against Feyenoord on Tuesday night.",

Both posed for photos in the stands with personalized shirts provided by the club.\n\nThe former then went pitchside after the match to spend time with Onana. There, they posed for photos and spoke before having a quick scrap on the pitch. A video they have both shared on social media since shows them assuming a boxing stance before Ngannou dives down to grab Onana's right leg, moves up to his waist, and drags the player to the ground from behind.\n\nFrom there, he positions himself on top before pretending to throw elbows at his head. Ngannou then rolls away as they both get back to their feet, after which, Onana comes over to shake hands before they hug each other.\n\nThe day after, Ngannou shared photos from the visit on his Instagram with the following caption: \"It was a lot of fun last night at Old Trafford during the game against Bodo/Glimt. We chatted after the game with the man of the night, the one and only Andre Onana. Thanks to Manchester United and the staff for the jersey.\"\n\nSoon after, Onana shared the footage alongside the caption: \"I demand a rematch in a real ring! [🤼] Let's settle this once and for all! Francis Ngannou.\"\n\nNgannou responded in a separate post: \"Andre Onana is asking for a rematch, and I don't think it's a good idea for him, but since he's insisting, I have no choice but to give the man what he wants.\" He also replied on X, formerly Twitter: \"Be careful what you ask for.

        "article_text": "Man United icon Sir Alex Ferguson vs Pep Guardiola has clear winner - only one has changed football - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United and Manchester City fans will debate until the end of time who is the better manager but one clear verdict is set to ruffle feathers\n\nBy\nJack Flintham\nSport Central Audience Writer\n\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy insists Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is better than Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson because the Catalonian has changed the sport.\n\nBoth Guardiola and Ferguson hold a lot of respect for each other and both hold legendary status' at their respective clubs. They have both won the treble, lifted the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Club World Cup during their tenures at City and United.\n\nDespite Ferguson having longevity on his side, Guardiola has often been credited for revolutionising how teams play football in England. Clubs up and down the pyramid tend to favour a passing system, sometimes to their detriment, thanks to the success of Guardiola at City.\n\nWriting in his Daily Mail column, Murphy believes that this reason sets the Catalonian apart from Ferguson. \"Sir Alex Ferguson was the ultimate boss,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Everybody wanted to emulate his Manchester United team, including us at Liverpool. Fergie’s biggest strength was motivating these great players to stay hungry all the time.\n\n\"When Pep Guardiola struggled in his first season at City, I thought the intensity of English football would stop him replicating his Barcelona success. But I was wrong.\n\n\"Guardiola shares Fergie’s attributes for man-management and making big decisions. But more than Fergie, he’s changed our sport.\n\n\"It’s not only other Premier League teams who build from defence, press to win it back and use tactical innovations like false nines and inverted full-backs – they’re doing it in Leagues One and Two and even at grassroots level. The Pep philosophy has spread to so many parts of the game.\"\n\nGuardiola will be hoping his philosophy eventually wins out at the Etihad Stadium as the Blues currently find themselves suffering one of their worst runs ever under their iconic boss. City are six games winless in all competitions ahead of tomorrow's trip to Liverpool in the Premier League.\n",

The 39-year-old oversaw his first win as Reds boss on Thursday night with the 3-2 victory over Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\n\nAmid the action on the pitch, United are seeing themselves credited with an interest in players they could potentially sign in the New Year. The [January transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news) is fast approaching, which will give Amorim the opportunity to strengthen his newly inherited squad for the second half of the campaign.\n\nHere, MEN Sport takes a look at some of the latest United transfer news and gossip that have generated headlines over the last 24 hours.\n\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United meet Jorge Mendes over possible Geovany Quenda transfer**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)\n\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim reveals Manchester United's drastic change in preparations for Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-manchester-uniteds-30479149)**\n\nUnited are continuing to be linked with a move for Atalanta midfielder Ederson. According to journalist [Alfredo Pedulla](https://www.alfredopedulla.com/il-retroscena-ederson-manchester-united-una-rincorsa-dalla-scorsa-estate/), United are still monitoring the Brazilian ahead of a potential move either in January or next summer.\n\nThe report claims that United would prefer to sign Ederson at the end of the season when the summer transfer window opens. Atalanta are reported to have set an asking price of €60million (£50million) for the midfielder.\n\nIt has been reported that United are determined to sign a new midfielder to strengthen Amorim's squad. Ederson has been identified as the ideal target, and the club will continue to monitor the 25-year-old throughout the rest of the campaign.\n\nElsewhere, United are being linked with a move for Juventus duo Douglas Luiz and Nicolo Fagioli. According to [Gazzetta dello Sport](https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Juventus/28-11-2024/mercato-juve-chi-arriva-se-partono-fagioli-e-douglas-luiz.shtml?refresh_ce), the Serie A club are weighing up the possibility of allowing the midfield duo to leave the club in 2025.\n\nThe report claims that Juventus sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has already travelled to Manchester with the purpose of trying to agree deals for Luiz and Fagioli's exits. It has been reported that United are a potential destination for both players, as are Man City, with a move in January a realistic possibility.",

        "article_text": "Joshua Zirkzee has been linked with a move away from Manchester United ahead of the January transfer window. (Image: Bradley Collyer/PA Wire.)\n\nIt’s back to Premier League action for Manchester United this weekend as Ruben Amorim takes charge of his first league game at Old Trafford.\n\nThe new United head coach managed his first game at the Stadium on Thursday night. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund (x2) saw the team come out as 3-2 winners over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nUnited are back in action on Sunday when they take on Everton at Old Trafford (1.30pm kick-off). Going into the match, United sit in 12th place in the Premier League table, having picked up 16 points from their opening 12 games.\n\nWhile we wait for the match, there has, as ever, been stories doing the rounds at Old Trafford. We have therefore taken a look at a couple and also given our own thoughts on the situation.\n\n### Van Nistelrooy new job confirmed\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy has been confirmed as the new manager of Leicester City, following his exit from Manchester United just under three weeks ago. The former striker joined United in the summer as Erik ten Hag’s assistant and took interim charge for four games following the sacking of Ten Hag.\n\nHe has now signed a two-and-a-half year deal with the Foxes and will hope to lead the club to Premier League safety. It means a reunion with United is on the cards, with the meeting between the two clubs set for March 15 at the King Power Stadium.\n\n**MEN Sport Says**: After a successful stint as interim boss, it’s good to see Van Nistelrooy get a chance to manage in the Premier League and United fans will be watching how he gets on with interest. United could also make the most of the new link between the two clubs in the transfer window.\n\nLeicester may be keen to take some of United’s players either on loan (they will however have to free up a loan space in their squad in order to do so), or permanent deals. The link could be useful to both teams going forward and provides a new option for players struggling to break through at Old Trafford.\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee stance outlined\n\nAhead of the January transfer window, there has been a lot of talk over Joshua Zirkzee, with Juventus linked with an interest in a potential loan deal just six months after he joined the club.\n\nHowever, journalist Gianluca Di Marzio has now given the latest, confirming that a move to the Italian giants is not going to happen. “Joshua Zirkzee and Douglas Luiz are linked to other teams every day,” he told Soccernews.nl.\n\n“Zirkzee to Juventus or Douglas Luiz back to the Premier League or Saudi Arabia, but they are out of the market at this moment. There are no chances or no discussion between Man Utd and the agent or Juventus and the agent, so they are happy to stay in Man Utd and Juventus.\n\n“They want to stay at their clubs and demonstrate their values, so that’s not going to happen in January.”\n\n**MEN Sport Says:** While Zirkzee has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford, I think it’s best for the striker that he stays at United, especially given the arrival of Ruben Amorim. While he is struggling for starts, Zirkzee is still yet to miss a Premier League game this season, so it’s not like he’s not getting any game time.\n\nWorking under Amorim will only benefit the 23-year-old. And he will hope to reap the benefits both the rest of the season and next season.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim's first Man United transfer move could hand Man City millions - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United are reportedly considering a move for Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap in 2025 after his impressive start to life in the Premier League.\n\nBy Isaac Seelochan Senior Sport Central Audience Writer\n\nTom Sunderland Sports Writer\n\n*   20:00, 29 NOV 2024\n\nManchester United have been linked with Liam Delap as Ruben Amorim eyes his first signing at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Reds are said to be eyeing up Ipswich Town's Liam Delap, who has been in scintillating form since his move from Manchester City. The 21 year old striker, who had loan spells at Stoke City and Preston before a standout stint at Hull City, has netted six times in his first 13 Premier League games for Ipswich.\n\nHowever, should United make a move for Delap, City would benefit from a 20 per cent sell-on clause in his contract. This means that Pep Guardiola's side would receive a portion of any future transfer fee, regardless of where he ends up. Delap's value is likely to have increased significantly after proving his worth in the top flight this season.\n\nThe son of former Stoke star Rory Delap, he played a crucial role in Ipswich's first-ever Premier League win over Tottenham and scored twice in a draw with Aston Villa, as well as netting an equaliser against Fulham.\n\nInterest in Delap has emerged just as Rasmus Hojlund is beginning to shine under Amorim. The Dane netted twice and provided an assist as United defeated Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, securing their second victory of the Europa League campaign.\n\nHojlund, also 21, aims to justify his £72m transfer fee by emulating the success Viktor Gyokeres enjoyed under Amorim at Sporting CP. United also have striker options in Rashford and summer recruit Joshua Zirkzee, although neither has managed to maintain consistent form this season.\n\nIt seems unlikely City will exercise their buy-back clause to reunite with Delap given their striker position is covered. Erling Haaland continues to top the Premier League goal charts with 12 goals so far this term and is rumoured to be signing a new lucrative contract at the Etihad.\n\nHaving experienced top-tier football under McKenna, Delap won't want to play a secondary role should he move next year. However, depending on his new value, United may have to indirectly give their fierce rivals a substantial sum if they wish to secure the player.",

The optimism from the head coach has not dampened following the opening two matches.\n\n\"I believe we will succeed,\" Amorim told the BBC at the end of his interview with the broadcaster. \"I think United will change my life but it will not change me.\n\n\"Everybody says this will change me… this will not change me.\" This shall likely please United fans considering the personality of Amorim is one which has drawn admiration from supporters so far.\n\n\"I think it is more powerful sometimes not to shout because when you are, you are and the players feel it,\" he explained. \"In training you can be demanding but afterwards, you can be one of them.\n\n\"To have a real connection you have to be in their shoes.\" Unlike a lot of the old-school managers of yesteryear, Amorim attended university in Portugal to learn how to manage his squad and even visited a therapist to, in his words, 'change things' about him as he transitioned from a player to a manager.\n\nPart of this journey taught Amorim to evolve his style to suit different members of his squad. One-to-one meetings with his players are going to be a regular part of the schedule for the United squad but these will take the form of informal chats on the way to the training pitch rather than mirror Jose Mourinho's style of calling players to his office.\n\nIt would be easy to describe Amorim as 'Mr. Nice Guy' but he has his ruthless streak. As a player, he was suspended twice by his manager and he has no desire to allow standards to slip.\n\nRuben Amorim smiles after Manchester United's victory over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League\n\n\"For me, some rules are for all but I treat my players differently because they are different people,\" he explained. \"I deal with each one of them in a different way.\n\n\"You can have some red lines that you cannot cross no matter who you are, but I deal with the players completely differently because they are different people.\" And the squad are not the only ones who will be set red lines.\n\nIneos are on notice too. Despite his deep affection for Sporting Lisbon, Amorim's club is Benfica.\n\nHe had the chance to join them as head coach while at Braga but admitted he rejected them because he felt he would not have full control in their system. Logic dictates that Amorim must feel he will have this control at United or else he would not have made the jump.\n\nIt is going to be a learning curve for Amorim in England, one which he has already acknowledged due to the media commitments and the size of United. But what is clear, is that the new boss will wish to put his own stamp on the club to take the Reds back to the top.",

Despite receiving a new offer from Bayern, the defender will be free to enter negotiations with clubs in the new year, should he not sign a fresh deal.\n\nAccording to [German outlet BILD](https://thedailybriefing.io/p/christian-falks-fact-files-monster), Bayern have already started working on a 'shortlist of replacements' as there is a possibility Davies will leave the club next summer. It's said his agent are 'dealing with other clubs' while United are reportedly yet to come to the negotiation table.\n\nThe report states the reason why United haven't yet approached Davies' entourage is because the club are 'waiting' to see what [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) plans are for January. It has been reported that the Portuguese tactician wants to work with the squad first before making a decision.\n\nHowever, there is a chance United 'could get really serious' about landing Davies, who has been on the club's radar for some time. The Canada international is also subject of interest from Real Madrid.\n\nThe defender himself, has already refused to entertain such speculation that is surrounding his future beyond the end of this season. \"As of now, my full focus is to stay healthy and to play the game with the club I'm with right now,\" Davies said last month.\n\n\"I'm not focused on what's going on in the future. I'm just focusing on staying healthy and helping my team win. My team make me feel valued. The whole Bayern community make me feel valued. I see that each and every day.\"",

This includes live broadcasting of all 380 matches and various magazine programs, delivered to 55 international broadcasters across 189 markets outside of Britain.\n\nIn a pivotal step, the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) clubs have unanimously agreed to take charge of producing and distributing their media content for global audiences from 2026 onwards.\n\nBy consolidating control over production, this could set the stage for the Premier League to introduce its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, an initiative previously touted as a \"Netflix of Football\" or \"Premflix\".\n\nThe NFL and NBA have already launched their own versions of this - NFL Game Pass and NBA League Pass. Europe often follows the lead of the more commercially mature US sports market.\n\nPaolo Pescatore of PP Foresight commented: \"In the first instance it feels like taking back ownership and control under one umbrella. This then in turn opens up new opportunities of distributing that content in different ways to existing and new viewers around the world.\n\n\"The direction of travel is clear as the adoption of connected devices continues to grow; we are all now streaming some form of television at any time and anywhere thanks to the internet via fibre or mobile networks.\"\n\n### Premflix 'a nice tool but not TV substitute'\n\nA direct-to-consumer platform would offer numerous benefits to the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league). Not only would it increase reach, being available to anyone with a device, but it could also gather customer data and potentially multiply revenue.\n\nA 2020 academic paper suggested that if the roughly 200 million people who currently subscribe to pay TV channels to watch the Premier League paid £10 a month for a dedicated streaming service, annual media rights income could skyrocket from £3.5bn to £24bn.\n\nWhile this may be an idealised scenario and does not factor in the costs of creating the content, the platform on which to show it, and marketing costs it does highlight the potential financial rewards of the right product.\n\nFrancois Godard from Enders Analysis remarked on the Premier Leagues move to handle their international media rights, saying it \"may be a clever move\". However, he emphasized the necessity of broadcasters: \"I don't see D2C \\[direct to consumer\\] as the future of football. Maybe it's an option you can use in certain markets,\" to negotiate better deals from media firms.\n\nFurther delving into American sports trends, Godard observed that long-term partnerships are formed between US leagues and broadcasters. He elaborated, saying: \"I don't believe the NFL and NBA D2C platforms are a substitute for sales to broadcasters,\" highlighting their usefulness as: \"They are a nice tool and a way to reach core fans.\"",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim reaction to Manchester United player shows he is starting to get what he wants - Samuel Luckhurst - Manchester Evening News\n\nMan United came from behind to secure their first win under Ruben Amorim against Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nBy\nSamuel Luckhurst Chief Manchester United writer\n*   22:08, 28 NOV 2024\n\nEdric Connor's dulcet tones crooned the Manchester United Calypso on the Old Trafford airwaves before kick-off. The football taught now is by Ruben Amorim. \n\nUnited navigated six changes, a half-time substitution, brief switches in formation and a one-goal deficit to secure a first win under Amorim. This United is a work in progress and sterner tests await.\n\nThe players had to think on their feet against the underrated Bodo/Glimt, a team that riled Jose Mourinho a few years ago. United will likely encounter more obdurate opponents in unambitious Everton on Sunday in a very different examination.\n\nAndre Onana resorted to time-wasting before added time and Amorim, ever present in the technical area, was often anxiously on his haunches. The referee charitably added only three more minutes. Casemiro diced with death outside his area with a handball. Onana punched Patrick Berg's free-kick away.\n\nThe 3-4-3 system was not entirely abandoned but United switched to a more conventional, tried and trusted back four without the ball after sieving two goals in the first half. Ironically, they ended the contest without a centre back on the pitch as Casemiro replaced the cumbersome Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nAmorim dicily decided to make all five substitutions before the 70-minute mark. Out of possession, the back four ended up as Noussair Mazraoui, Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot. \n\nCasemiro's lax reaction to Dalot's loose pass played Andre Onana into trouble. Bodo's staff in their dugout and the analysts in the press box were up in arms after the ball hit Onana's hand outside the area in the 76th minute.\n\nAmorim's maiden victory was made possible by one of his changes. Rasmus Hojlund doubled his tally for the campaign and Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute goal was down to Hojlund's hard yards to leave the Argentine with a vacant net. Hojlund's involvement in all three goals - pressing, technique and instinct - showcased different qualities United need to see more often from their number nine.\n\nHojlund received that number over Joshua Zirkzee for several reasons and he is on trial over the next six months to gauge whether a prolific goalscorer-in-making is currently on United's books. This was an uplifting night for the Dane against the Norwegians.\n\nAmorim expected a good challenge from Bodo due to their work-rate and Mason Mount was one of the busiest in red. He earned a bullish chest-bump and pat from his coach when he made way. Slowly, Amorim is getting what he wants. This was Mount's first start in 96 days and he acquitted himself promisingly in a position and system he is familiar with from Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Chelsea.\n\nDavid Moyes received an undeserved fixed banner on the Stretford End 11 years ago. The 'Bem-vindo a casa Ruben' - welcome home Ruben - tricolor that was unfurled in the stand's first tier is temporary. The 'a casa' was barely readable due to the slanted unveiling.\n\nEuropean nights are still relatively low key, even for a United manager or head coach's debut. There was warm, if not rapturous, applause for Amorim upon his emergence.\n\nThe United followers were louder 48 seconds into the contest. Amorim barely celebrated Garnacho's goal and instead coolly took a swig from a water bottle on a night many donned thermals inside the ground.\n\nGarnacho's goal was his eighth of a decent campaign. He will feel he should have already broken double figures and surpassed his ten-goal haul of last season. There were two more presentable opportunities where he failed to hit the target. Perhaps fortunate to retain his place amid six changes, he still continued his penchant for following up a negative performance with a positive one in under a minute.\n\nHojlund merits the credit for forcing the appalling error from goalkeeper Nikita Haikin through pressing. That is something Marcus Rashford seldom offers and Hojlund, for all his shortcomings, is a workaholic who runs himself into the ground.\n\nManuel Ugarte was paired with a different midfielder in Bruno Fernandes, relocated to a deeper position. Amorim urged the midfield duo not to become too detached from the back three yet minutes later the gap was too wide when United were brilliantly breached by Hakon Evjen for the equaliser. Onana complained the defensive shield was inadequate and he had a point.\n\nThis was Tyrell Malacia's first start in 550 days and it was too soon. It may crush Malacia's confidence that he was outpaced so effortlessly by Philip Zinckernagel as he put Bodo ahead. That was the first true endurance test for Malacia since his recovery from two knee operations and he was patently slower than before he went under the knife.\n\nDe Ligt, another Dutch arrival under Erik ten Hag, inexplicably failed to anticipate Zinckernagel's superiority. By the time he slid in, the ball was goalbound. Amorim directed his ire at Lisandro Martinez for going walkabout and leaving Malacia exposed. Amorim reached for the water bottle again and this time had to keep his cool. Or resist kicking it. Malacia made way for Dalot at the interval.\n\nBy the 29th minute, Bodo fans were chanting 'Olé'. Antony and Manuel Ugarte irked the United supporters with backward passes. Mazraoui, a hitherto successful signing by Ten Hag, ensured the half-time shrill would not be soundtracked to boos with some nifty footwork and cross for Hojlund to score. He started the second half as he ended the first with another.",

        "article_text": "Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale posted his first tweet since May following his side's 1-1 draw with Brighton - and it quickly went viral.\n\nCameron Archer thought he had put the Saints 2-1 ahead on 67 minutes, only to see his goal ruled out for offside after VAR deemed Adam Armstrong had interfered with play.\n\nThe decision, however, took four-and-a-half minutes to reach, and Southampton fans were left furious at the outcome.\n\nManager Russell Martin described the process behind the decision as a 'big problem': \"We've been told it's because Adam Armstrong affects Verbruggen, the goalkeeper.\n\n\"I'd understand if the ball went in front of Adam, if the cross was close enough to come and claim, which it's not, and if he moves because of Adam's run. He does none of them. He steps away from Adam to try and go into Cameron Archer.\n\n\"We either have VAR to correct problems or not. When there's a goal, it's a big problem.\"\n\nAnd Ramsdale, who missed the game at the Amex Stadium as he is recovering from a fractured finger, took to Twitter to make his feelings clear.\n\nHe simply wrote: \"You can not be serious,\" alongside a facepalm emoji.\n\nThe goalkeeper has only tweeted four times since October 2023 - underlining just how seriously he felt about the decision that went against his side.\n\nThe Saints went behind in the first half through Kaoru Mitoma's 29th-minute goal, but equalised in the second half through Flynn Downes.\n\nThey have won only once this season and are rooted to the bottom of the Premier League with just five points from their 13 games.\n\nMartin had a heated confrontation with Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler at full-time as tensions boiled over, and told media: \"The manager decided to say something, I think he said it's about respect in the press. I've never seen an manager try to get opposition players booked as much as that.\n\n\"Respect is mutual and reciprocal.\"",

I'm disappointed, but we will see.\"\n\nHowever, on Friday, his latest social media post got Liverpool fans thinking.\n\nThe former Chelsea man posted a story to Instagram which showed him walking towards Liverpool’s ‘AXA Training Centre’ located in Kirkby, Liverpool.\n\nOf course, exactly what the photograph means is up for debate, but Liverpool fans were quick to give their thoughts on social media.\n\nOne said: “Sign the contract, big boy.”\n\nAnother added: “Ready to sign a new contract.”\n\nWith a third saying: “Mo just has that aura around him. This man needs to be paid!”\n\nA fourth explained: “He’s trying to use leverage to get the best deal. Both sides are clearly signalling they want to make a deal so it will very likely happen.”\n\nSalah will likely start the Premier League match against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday – a win would send the Reds 11 points clear of Pep Guardiola’s side.",

Veltman – who spent eight years at Ajax before moving to the Amex in 2020 for £900,000 – is 11 months older than his manager and his experience has proved invaluable to his side in the absence of the captain, Lewis Dunk, through injury. He is expected to return against Russell Martin’s side as Brighton attempt to record a fourth clean sheet of the league season, not to mention take the opportunity to move into second place before the rest of the weekend’s fixtures. **Ed Aarons**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Brighton v Southampton, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n2\n\nA new Foxes era under Van Nistelrooy?\n-------------------------------------\n\nUnencumbered by any previous association with Nottingham Forest, Ruud van Nistelrooy would probably be [a popular appointment at the King Power Stadium](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ruud-van-nistelrooy-set-to-succeed-steve-cooper-as-leicester-manager), with all available evidence at the time of writing suggesting the Dutchman’s first match in charge of Leicester could even be at the unlikely fortress that is the Gtech Community Stadium. During his spell as interim manager of Manchester United, Van Nistelrooy made no attempt to disguise his enthusiasm for the job and brings trophy-winning experience to Leicester having won the Dutch Cup in his sole season in charge of PSV Eindhoven. Tactically flexible with whatever players he has at his disposal, Van Nistelrooy’s preferred style is to marry quick, attacking intent with defensive solidity and could quickly endear himself to a fanbase that took no time at all to tire of Steve Cooper’s defensive approach. The approach he adopts against the side with the top flight’s best home record will be intriguing. **Barry Glendenning**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Brentford v Leicester, Saturday 3pm_\n    \n\n![Image 3: Steve Cooper and Ruud van Nistelrooy during Leicester’s Carabao Cup tie with Manchester United on 30 October](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/081180bd48b86e5238f58c1ab37b2f705657cdde/0_125_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend#img-2)\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy (right) is the frontrunner succeed Steve Cooper.

The Austrian will be hoping that Eberechi Eze can make his comeback against Newcastle after a hamstring injury that has sidelined him since the [win over Aston Villa](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/aston-villa-crystal-palace-carabao-cup-match-report) in the EFL Cup last month, with Adam Wharton also closing in on a return for a tricky run of fixtures over the next few weeks that includes trips to Ipswich and Brighton, and home games against Manchester City and Arsenal. A repeat of April’s 2-0 win over Newcastle at Selhurst Park courtesy of two goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta would settle the nerves in south London, with Ismaïla Sarr likely to start for a fourth successive match after his first Premier League goal, [against Villa last week](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). **EA**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Crystal Palace v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n4\n\nOld-school strikers at City Ground\n----------------------------------\n\nHaving suffered back-to-back losses for the first time this season, [Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest) welcome Ipswich to the City Ground and will be hoping to rediscover the defensive mojo that served them so well before their recent reverses. After conceding only seven goals in their opening 10 matches of the campaign, Nuno Espírito Santo’s side have shipped six in their past two and, in Liam Delap, Forest’s central defensive duo of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will have to deal with quite the handful. Strong as a bull and a terrific ball-carrier who is as fast as he is fearless, the Ipswich striker’s battle against one of the league’s most impressive defensive partnerships this season ought to make for compelling viewing. In Chris Wood, Forest have a comparatively elderly bulldozer of their own and with both centre-forwards in form and responsible for half their sides’ combined Premier League goal tally of 28, this could be a classic battle of the big men. **BG**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Nottingham Forest v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm_\n    \n\n![Image 4: Liam Delap of Ipswich tussles with Matthijs de Ligt of Manchester tussle during their 1-1 draw](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/223aa2aeb4a34d8fde99b58a84e02280a83ae74b/0_151_2946_1768/master/2946.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend#img-3)\n\nLiam Delap has proven a handful for Premier League defences this season.

Wolves have scored six goals across their past two matches, Matheus Cunha contributing half of them, but in truth their ability to score was never the primary source of concern. Only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka this season have been involved in more goals than Cunha, who has provided seven goals and three assists. Wolves have kept a sole clean sheet in the league and, out of necessity, their captain, Mario Lemina, dropped to centre-back in the [victory against Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report) last time out. With Santiago Bueno and Craig Dawson returning to fitness before hosting Bournemouth, suddenly Wolves are looking up. Andoni Iraola knows all about that, having kicked off the month by [beating Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/bournemouth-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report). **Ben Fisher**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Wolves v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n6\n\nSoler offers ray of light for West Ham\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere was not unanimous agreement at West Ham over the decision to sign Carlos Soler on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Julen Lopetegui wanted the Spain midfielder but others were not as convinced. Some in the recruitment department had eyes on Chelsea’s Carney Chukwuemeka. Yet Lopetegui got his way and the first sign that he might have made the right call came in [West Ham’s win at Newcastle](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/newcastle-west-ham-premier-league-match-report) on Monday. Soler had not looked up to the pace of the Premier League previously. He was taken off at half-time against Manchester United last month, but was impressive at St James’ Park. Playing in a central role, Soler’s quick thinking in possession made West Ham slicker on the ball. Lopetegui will hope that resurgence continues against Arsenal. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _West Ham v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n7\n\nRotation of egos a test for Maresca\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt is a tricky balancing act for Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. Enzo Fernández was out for a while, then in again. The midfielder has five assists in three games, cooling talk of a departure. For Maresca, though, it is not easy to keep every member of his squad happy. João Félix looked miffed not to come off the bench against Arsenal early this month. The Portugal attacker made a surprise start [against Leicester last week](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report), with Pedro Neto unavailable, but what of Christopher Nkunku, Mykhailo Mudryk and Jadon Sancho? There have been noises in recent weeks about Nkunku getting frustrated over his lack of game time. Sancho, meanwhile, has not started in more than a month and Mudryk remains an enigma. Will there be opportunities against Aston Villa? Maresca has a lot of attacking options and things are going well at the moment, but managing the egos in his squad will challenge the Italian. **JS**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Chelsea v Aston Villa, Sunday 1.30pm_\n    \n\n![Image 5: João Félix runs forward during Chelsea’s Premier League match at Leicester City](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234704905d1224dc13980566592cd5fe36487d7f/3_157_2630_1578/master/2630.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/29/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend#img-4)\n\nJoão Félix has been in and out of Chelsea’s team.

Prime in this vision has to be creating more chances because United are arid when going forward, a desert before goal, Thursday night’s 3-2 Europa League win against Bodø/Glimy notwithstanding. Sean Dyche sets his sides up pragmatically so Everton, only five points behind the hosts, will be an apt test of this. Dyche will plot to turn United over on their own patch, and with Old Trafford expectant that, finally, Amorim can be the man, this should be a riveting watch. **Jamie Jackson**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Manchester United v Everton, Sunday 1.30pm_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n9\n\nForster’s time to shine against Fulham\n--------------------------------------\n\nTottenham have won six and lost five of their 12 Premier League matches this season, their only draw coming against Leicester in an opening game they might have lost but for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario. The Italian goalkeeper will be absent [for the foreseeable future](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/shock-for-tottenham-as-guglielmo-vicario-has-surgery-on-fractured-ankle), his fractured ankle the large cloud that overshadowed Tottenham’s fine [win over Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) last weekend. The job of deputising for Vicario will presumably fall to Fraser Forster, a state of affairs that has prompted much agonising over the 36-year-old’s ability – or perceived lack thereof – to play a style of football where he is required to ping short passes to his defenders. Ange Postecoglou has dismissed any such concerns, telling reporters it is a skill more related to mindset than ability. No doubt aware of concerns over the drop-off in quality between himself and Vicario, now is the time for Tottenham’s hulking backup goalkeeper to demonstrate he can also be mentally imposing. **BG**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Tottenham v Fulham, Sunday 1.30pm_\n    \n\n* * *\n\n10\n\nThreat level highest for Guardiola\n----------------------------------\n\nArne Slot has brought the Midas touch to Liverpool but, of all the accomplishments in his remarkable start, none would surpass the likelihood of releasing Manchester City’s four-year grip on the Premier League title on the first day of December. The prospect of going 11 points clear of the champions with an 18th win in 20 matches under Slot makes this a hugely anticipated and consequential moment for Liverpool. Yet the stakes are even higher for City. Five defeats in six games and a late collapse to [draw against Slot’s former club Feyenoord](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-city-feyenoord-champions-league-match-report) have drained belief from Pep Guardiola’s players. Without Rodri they appear as fragile as Liverpool were in the aftermath of losing Virgil van Dijk to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury in 2020. Josko Gvardiol’s error-strewn performances are an added problem for Guardiola, who must decide whether to risk playing the Croatian against Mohamed Salah. City’s famed powers of recovery are merely an illusion at present. They must rediscover them at Anfield, where Guardiola has never won in front of a crowd. **Andy Hunter**\n\n* * *\n\n*   _Liverpool v [Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity), Sunday 4pm_\n    \n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Newcastle | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\-1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 12 | \\-4 | 15 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\-7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\-8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\-8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\-10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\-7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\-15 | 4",

The decision has been greeted with dismay by the supporters’ trust, which fears this is the first step before “a significant price rise” next season.\n\nThe move comes as part of the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s efforts to make United more financially sustainable in the face of losses. Those tickets previously started at £40 for adults and £25 for children. Of the seats available to members across the rest of the season, 97% have been sold and the money raised by the increase is expected to be in the low millions of pounds.\n\nIn the long term Ratcliffe believes more prudent investment in the football operation is the prime way to make United more financially sound. Their debt totals £714m, comprising non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter rose from £36.5m in June’s end-of-year accounts because of United’s revolving credit facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nA Manchester United Supporters Trust statement in response to the ticket price changes said: “The club has provided zero consultation on the matter, neither with the forum nor the Fan Advisory Board nor MUST. We were simply informed of the decision that there will be price rises affecting certain fans that are ‘urgently needed’ to address profitability and sustainability concerns.\n\n“There is a risk that this is only the opening salvo of what will surely be massive pressure to implement a significant price rise for next season. Once they have got used to charging £132 for a parent and child to come to [Old Trafford], will they really go back to the old pricing levels for next season?”\n\nUnited and Everton fans will stage a protest against ticket prices before their Premier League clash on Sunday. Supporters are being asked to gather next to the trinity statue outside Old Trafford to support the Football Supporters’ Association’s Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. As well as increasing prices generally, fans are unhappy about the removal of concession tickets for certain groups.",

The Norwegian side had won 6-1 at home. Photograph: AllShotLive/Action Plus/Shutterstock\n\nBodø/Glimt: from Arctic football outpost to centre stage at Old Trafford\n========================================================================\n\n‘It’s been quite a journey,’ says midfielder Ulrik Saltnes of the Norwegian club’s rise, an example across Scandinavia\n\nBack in 2011, Bodø/Glimt were cash-strapped and forced into a routine beloved of park footballers. They were labouring in Norway’s second tier and – as their sporting director, Håvard Sakariassen, puts it – had “hit the wall”. Those long trips from inside the Arctic Circle feel even more onerous when you are doing everything yourself and, as they prepare to visit [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), they would be forgiven a moment to marvel at how the picture has transformed.\n\n“We didn’t have a kit manager so we washed our kit at home and came to training already dressed,” says Sakariassen, who had recently quit as a player and found himself taking de facto responsibility for managing the team’s equipment. “To compare that to our resources today, it is a totally different world.”\n\nIt says everything that, when Bodø/Glimt walk out at Old Trafford, they will neither look nor feel out of place. This is their fifth successive season of European football and they have racked up the scalps. A Roma team managed by José Mourinho were famously [thrashed 6-1](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/21/europa-conference-league-roma-bodo-glimt-roundup) at their Aspmyra Stadion in the 2021-22 Conference League. [Celtic](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/bodo-glimt-celtic-europa-conference-league-play-off-second-leg-match-report) and, in the Europa League this season, [Porto are among](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/25/european-football-porto-lose-to-bodglimt-as-lazio-beat-dynamo-kyiv) a string of other victims. [Arsenal were run mightily close](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/13/bodo-glimt-arsenal-europa-league-match-report) when they visited two years ago. Whereas once there was novelty value in seeing a club from northern Europe’s furthest reaches, and a home town of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, bloodying big-name noses, they now feel like a staple.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey,” says Ulrik Saltnes, a long-serving midfielder who has made 370 appearances since joining in those days when a return to the top flight seemed some way off. “It’s almost hard to imagine really. Everything was so much smaller. There were so fewer people and the level was completely different. From being a team bouncing up and down the leagues to being a stable team in Europe every season since 2020, it’s just not comparable at all.”\n\nThat stability has coincided with the tenure of Kjetil Knutsen, a 56-year-old manager who has been linked with Premier League jobs but remains at the helm of Norway’s dominant force. [Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/bodoglimt) had never won an Eliteserien title until four years ago, when they streaked away at the top by 19 points. They have claimed two more and, as long as they beat Lillestrøm in a grandstand finale to the domestic campaign on Sunday, will add another.\n\nIt has been a triumph of club‑building: a success story unalloyed by wealthy backers or reckless gambles. Bodø/Glimt picked a proactive, progressive style of football and stuck with it, recruiting imaginatively while sticking firmly to their local roots. Bayern Leverkusen’s Nigeria striker Victor Boniface cut his teeth there but the overwhelming majority of Knutsen’s squad is Norwegian. They have been able to reinvest several hefty transfer fees but, as Sakariassen says: “We don’t see ourselves as a selling club.”\n\nJens Hauge celebrates scoring Bodø/Glimt’s third goal against Porto in September’s 3-2 win. Photograph: NTB/Reuters\n\nInstead they are driven by process. “We don’t have any goals in the club,” Sakariassen says. “We don’t, before the season, say: ‘Our aim is to become No 1 or 2.’ Or: ‘We’re going to win 80% of the home games.’ We threw that in the bin six years ago. We just work on trying to get better every day, doing the smart things, just working hard and only having one focus: to get the product to get better.”\n\nThey have succeeded in that. Outwardly bigger clubs in Scandinavia readily accept Bodø/Glimt have become a model for how clubs in the region might thrive. A region whose clubs’ influence on the continental stage has faded is represented by a standard bearer few could have expected. It would be a welcome bonus for Sakariassen and his cohort if they could help raise the levels of all around them. “I think you will see Norwegian teams doing well in future,” he says. “We push each other.”\n\nSaltnes points out that domestic opponents have found ways to tackle Bodø/Glimt that European rivals are yet to grasp. The tightness of this year’s title race, Brann poised a point behind, suggests so. Last year Knutsen’s team finished nine points clear of the same opponents so perhaps they will not become the kind of wrecking ball that has dominated similarly sized championships while giving little to the wider ecosystem.\n\nThe focus, though, remains on themselves. Bodø/Glimt’s next local project will be to build a new stadium, although nothing beyond their means. The charmingly atmospheric Aspmyra will be replaced by a slightly bigger 10,000-capacity venue. It will surely host Champions League football at some stage. They should have made a remarkable debut in this season’s group phase but, having taken a two-goal lead against Red Star Belgrade in the playoffs, were consigned to a 3-2 aggregate defeat.\n\nSuch a close-run thing was a further indicator of their progress. Performing at Old Trafford will be, too, and there will be some personal significance for Sakariassen, who admits to being one of the many Norwegians who followed United as a youngster. The main source of pride, though, comes from putting his home town near the centre of on the European map against all odds.\n\n“When I travel around Europe it’s weird for me, coming from Bodø and knowing the history that we are a small club, that everyone knows us. It’s amazing for us, and also to see the impact the club has in Bodø, in the north of Norway and also in Norway. It’s really extraordinary for me as a Bodø/Glimt boy.",

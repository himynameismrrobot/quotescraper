Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 37: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

That means in terms of his mentality, and maybe his attitude, a little bit is going to have to change.\\n    \\n    Once he got his goal against [Ipswich](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town), he seemed to settle for it but when you look at how Amorim’s Sporting team's worked with and without the ball, that is something Rashford is will have learn he has to do. It is down to him as an individual to adapt.\\n    \\n    But it is sad. As an outsider looking in, it is sad to see him looking miserable and not looking like he is enjoying playing. When you feel that way you really do not get the best out of yourself.\\n    \\n    I have been there when you are at a club and you do not feel like you want to be there. It is really difficult to pick yourself up and carry on and he seems to be in that moment at United. Maybe it is time for him to move on to get back to his best because unless he changes his mentality a little bit and Amorim can get him working, then I do not see a place for him in the team.\\n    \\n    The manager will certainly want him to play. We know Rashford is a quality player on his day, we know what he can do and it is about getting him back to being the player that he can be.\\n    \\n    _Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson_\\n    \\n    ![Image 53: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

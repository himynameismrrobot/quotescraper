So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\nOn the early goal: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\nOn Noussair Mazraoui: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\nOn his first taste of the Premier League: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge. However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\nOn the early goal: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\nOn Noussair Mazraoui: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\nOn his first taste of the Premier League: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge. However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The Red Devils paid £34 million for Zirkzee's services and it was hoped that he would give them another option in attack.\n\nHe enjoyed a dream start by scoring on his debut against Fulham, coming off the bench to net the winner in United's first game of the season back in August.\n\nBut the Netherlands international has failed to find the net since then and has been linked with an early exit after failing to impress.\n\nZirkzee has been tipped to make swift return back to Italy, with Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli said to be keen - with the latter reportedly discussing a potential swap deal involving Victor Osimhen.\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Ruben Amorim has already made up his mind on Zirkzee and is actively trying to help him secure a move away from United. While his preference would be to head back to Italy, Amorim's former club Sporting CP are believed to have expressed interest over a possible January move and there was even a suggestion that United could try to use him as a makeweight in a pursuit of the in-demand Victor Gyokeres.\n\nBut interestingly, Zirkzee could receive an opportunity to remain in England as Aston Villa are the latest side to throw \"their hat into the ring\" for the former Bayern Munich man's signature.\n\nAfter a recent blip, Villa are currently eighth in the Premier League, three points off the top four after 12 games. However the west Midlands side are well-stocked for strikers, with both Ollie Watkins and Jhon Duran the key options up top for Unai Emery's side.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The Red Devils paid £34 million for Zirkzee's services and it was hoped that he would give them another option in attack.\n\nHe enjoyed a dream start by scoring on his debut against Fulham, coming off the bench to net the winner in United's first game of the season back in August.\n\nBut the Netherlands international has failed to find the net since then and has been linked with an early exit after failing to impress.\n\nZirkzee has been tipped to make swift return back to Italy, with Juventus, AC Milan and Napoli said to be keen - with the latter reportedly discussing a potential swap deal involving Victor Osimhen.\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Ruben Amorim has already made up his mind on Zirkzee and is actively trying to help him secure a move away from United. While his preference would be to head back to Italy, Amorim's former club Sporting CP are believed to have expressed interest over a possible January move and there was even a suggestion that United could try to use him as a makeweight in a pursuit of the in-demand Victor Gyokeres.\n\nBut interestingly, Zirkzee could receive an opportunity to remain in England as Aston Villa are the latest side to throw \"their hat into the ring\" for the former Bayern Munich man's signature.\n\nAfter a recent blip, Villa are currently eighth in the Premier League, three points off the top four after 12 games. However the west Midlands side are well-stocked for strikers, with both Ollie Watkins and Jhon Duran the key options up top for Unai Emery's side.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

City lost their fifth consecutive game in a row for the first time since 2006, with the unwanted landmark being reached by Pep Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career. It was the manner of the defeat that will have worried the Spaniard the most, though, with City consistently being carved open defensively. While they created plenty of chances going forward, Erling Haaland missed two clear-cut opportunities - one of which could have given them an early lead. Spurs only had nine shots to City's 23 but made them count, with James Maddison scoring a brace and both Pedro Porro and Brennan Johnson also finding the net. It is uncharted territory for City under their current ownership, and they will end the weekend eight points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool if Arne Slot's side win at Southampton. The defeat will no doubt be one that Guardiola and his players will want to move on from quickly - and it seems as if the club's social media account might want to do the same. They posted a two-minute highlights clip of the 4-0 loss under half an hour after full-time - and fans were all saying the same thing in response. City are next in action on Tuesday when they host Feyenoord in the Champions League.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

City lost their fifth consecutive game in a row for the first time since 2006, with the unwanted landmark being reached by Pep Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career. It was the manner of the defeat that will have worried the Spaniard the most, though, with City consistently being carved open defensively. While they created plenty of chances going forward, Erling Haaland missed two clear-cut opportunities - one of which could have given them an early lead. Spurs only had nine shots to City's 23 but made them count, with James Maddison scoring a brace and both Pedro Porro and Brennan Johnson also finding the net. It is uncharted territory for City under their current ownership, and they will end the weekend eight points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool if Arne Slot's side win at Southampton. The defeat will no doubt be one that Guardiola and his players will want to move on from quickly - and it seems as if the club's social media account might want to do the same. They posted a two-minute highlights clip of the 4-0 loss under half an hour after full-time - and fans were all saying the same thing in response. City are next in action on Tuesday when they host Feyenoord in the Champions League.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

His versatility, coupled with his natural ability to play with his left foot could also earmark him as an alternative to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite.\"\n\nAmorim has also been impressed by the injury-plagued Mason Mount in his opening few days as United manager. “Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,” he told the club's media on Friday. “You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\n\n“I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he’s trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he’s shown, for example, in Chelsea.”\n\nAmorim added: “He played in this system [before], so it’s perfect for him.

His versatility, coupled with his natural ability to play with his left foot could also earmark him as an alternative to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite.\"\n\nAmorim has also been impressed by the injury-plagued Mason Mount in his opening few days as United manager. “Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,” he told the club's media on Friday. “You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\n\n“I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he’s trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he’s shown, for example, in Chelsea.”\n\nAmorim added: “He played in this system [before], so it’s perfect for him. I have two positions for Mason Mount, so he should be very happy.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

We've never paid a footballer. They buy part of the company and become shareholders.”\nThe stance is echoed on Sokito’s website, which states that players wear the boots as they “truly believe in the product and the mission”.\nThe list of footballers involved in the company is stacked to the say the least and includes former Manchester United midfielder and current Watford boss Tom Cleverley, Germany and Wolfsburg’s Felix Nmecha, USA and FC Cincinnati star DeAndre Yedlin, William Troost Ekong of Saudi Pro League side Al Kholood and the Nigeria national team and women's star Jasmyne Spencer, who plays her club football with Angel City in the NWSL.\nAlthough not all of them wear the boots because of existing boot deals, these passionate players have a great deal of influence, to the point where they are involved in key decisions for designs in a WhatsApp group.\nTo have them onboard is amazing,” Hardy added.\n“To have them involved to help grow the business, it's super valuable. They do so much for us.\n\"We have a WhatsApp group with all the players and all of the designs are voted for by players. Every little thing which goes to market has gone through a panel of more than 40 players. It's amazing and gives us a unique perspective.”\nHardy, who used to work in sales, combined his two passions of shoes and football in creating the brand.\nThe idea spawned when he was on holiday in Hoi An in Vietnam and tried to get a local market tailor shop to make a pair of football boots but was unsuccessful.\nHe would go on to find out that 12.5 million football boots go to landfill every year and slowly but surely, his football boot brand’s key focus would be all about being sustainable and eco-friendly.\nJake explained: \"Football is the thing which touches everything and is better at spreading positive messages than anything else. It shouldn't be contributing to the climate crisis; it should be the thing which helps us to fix it.\n\"We're constantly trying to make football products which have less of an impact on the environment.\nThe brand managed to launch and eventually developed the cclasy Devista, which took three years and is primarily made from recycled materials like carpet and plastic bottles.\nTheir second release is the game-changing Scudetta, which was launched by former Watford defender Troost-Ekong when he represented Nigeria and was named Player of the Tournament at the Africa Cup of Nations at the start of the year.\nThe completely innovative premium speed boot, priced at £174.99 and available in three colourways, is one of the lightest boots on the market at just 182 grams and is made up of bio-based materials like corn waste, wood fibres, sugarcane, bamboo, castor beans and recycled polyester from plastic bottles.\n\"You take sustainable material, if it's recycled or bio-based like a plant of some kind,” Hardy said on the process.\n\"The industry is developing so fast that it will only get better and better.\nThe brand is growing every month and retail sales are improving to around 300 per cent on year.\nThey want their boots to regularly be on show at Sunday League games up and down the country but will not veer away from their principles.\nAsked about how they intend to mix it up with the big boys over the next five to ten years, Hardy said: “I think if you're a challenger brand doing the exact same thing as those brands, it's going to be a tough time because why would people change?\n\"In comparison to those brands, we're completely different. They're big brands which make sports product and football is only one of their departments.\n\"We do it in a very different way and we will always do it in a different way. We want to stay in our own lane, but we make football boots which are as good as theirs in terms of what you get for the price.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

We've never paid a footballer. They buy part of the company and become shareholders.”\nThe stance is echoed on Sokito’s website, which states that players wear the boots as they “truly believe in the product and the mission”.\nThe list of footballers involved in the company is stacked to the say the least and includes former Manchester United midfielder and current Watford boss Tom Cleverley, Germany and Wolfsburg’s Felix Nmecha, USA and FC Cincinnati star DeAndre Yedlin, William Troost Ekong of Saudi Pro League side Al Kholood and the Nigeria national team and women's star Jasmyne Spencer, who plays her club football with Angel City in the NWSL.\nAlthough not all of them wear the boots because of existing boot deals, these passionate players have a great deal of influence, to the point where they are involved in key decisions for designs in a WhatsApp group.\nTo have them onboard is amazing,” Hardy added.\n“To have them involved to help grow the business, it's super valuable. They do so much for us.\n\"We have a WhatsApp group with all the players and all of the designs are voted for by players. Every little thing which goes to market has gone through a panel of more than 40 players. It's amazing and gives us a unique perspective.”\nHardy, who used to work in sales, combined his two passions of shoes and football in creating the brand.\nThe idea spawned when he was on holiday in Hoi An in Vietnam and tried to get a local market tailor shop to make a pair of football boots but was unsuccessful.\nHe would go on to find out that 12.5 million football boots go to landfill every year and slowly but surely, his football boot brand’s key focus would be all about being sustainable and eco-friendly.\nJake explained: \"Football is the thing which touches everything and is better at spreading positive messages than anything else. It shouldn't be contributing to the climate crisis; it should be the thing which helps us to fix it.\n\"We're constantly trying to make football products which have less of an impact on the environment.\nThe brand managed to launch and eventually developed the cclasy Devista, which took three years and is primarily made from recycled materials like carpet and plastic bottles.\nTheir second release is the game-changing Scudetta, which was launched by former Watford defender Troost-Ekong when he represented Nigeria and was named Player of the Tournament at the Africa Cup of Nations at the start of the year.\nThe completely innovative premium speed boot, priced at £174.99 and available in three colourways, is one of the lightest boots on the market at just 182 grams and is made up of bio-based materials like corn waste, wood fibres, sugarcane, bamboo, castor beans and recycled polyester from plastic bottles.\n\"You take sustainable material, if it's recycled or bio-based like a plant of some kind,” Hardy said on the process.\n\"The industry is developing so fast that it will only get better and better.\nThe brand is growing every month and retail sales are improving to around 300 per cent on year.\nThey want their boots to regularly be on show at Sunday League games up and down the country but will not veer away from their principles.\nAsked about how they intend to mix it up with the big boys over the next five to ten years, Hardy said: “I think if you're a challenger brand doing the exact same thing as those brands, it's going to be a tough time because why would people change?\n\"In comparison to those brands, we're completely different. They're big brands which make sports product and football is only one of their departments.\n\"We do it in a very different way and we will always do it in a different way. We want to stay in our own lane, but we make football boots which are as good as theirs in terms of what you get for the price.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Ipswich might have won but for a clutch of fine saves by the United goalkeeper, André Onana.\n\n“It’s hard to expect anything now,” Amorim said. “It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game. That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different.\n\n“It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything but we \\[must not\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here. We try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and in the next year we will be better.\n\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?’ They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period. This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\n\n“We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like [taking] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ipswich might have won but for a clutch of fine saves by the United goalkeeper, André Onana.\n\n“It’s hard to expect anything now,” Amorim said. “It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game. That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different.\n\n“It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything but we \\[must not\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here. We try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and in the next year we will be better.\n\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?’ They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period. This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\n\n“We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like [taking] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

It would be tempting at the end of this decelerating game of semi-football to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It would be tempting at the end of this decelerating game of semi-football to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Or to last. There were 82 seconds on the stadium clock when the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United was jumpstarted. The new manager had put his faith in Marcus Rashford in the No 9 role and it was United’s great enigma who put them in front. Rashford charged about in the early running, a point to prove.\n\nAnd yet it was the prompt for a slow retreat by United for the remainder of the first half. The structure was different, United set up in Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations and faultlines from Erik ten Hag’s tenure. Control proved elusive. As it did so often under Ten Hag.\n\nIpswich were the better team before the interval and the excellent Omari Hutchinson got the goal they deserved before the end of it with a shot from distance that took a deflection off Noussair Mazraoui. Ipswich had won for the first time this season at Tottenham before the international break. This was in point-gained territory for them.\n\nNot so for United. After all of the talking and, goodness gracious, there has been some talking, Amorim’s arrival feeling like the coming of the messiah, it was time for United to fire some optimism. They could not do it. They were a bit better in the second period but not hugely and it looked as though the players had too much to process in terms of instructions. It all became stilted. Then again, as everyone knows, least of all Amorim, it will take time. He has only had two training sessions with the full squad.\n\nUnited had risen one place in the table on Saturday without playing – evidence, the club’s support hoped, of Amorim’s magic – and there was always going to be a spotlight on his first starting XI. Amorim talked on Friday about the need to “adapt some players” because he did not have the right profiles for his three-at-the-back system and there were a few square pegs in round holes, especially the left-footed attacking midfielder Amad Diallo at right wing-back.\n\nAmorim did not have three fit specialist centre-halves – there were four out with injuries – and so it was the full-back, Mazraoui, on the right of the back three. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in central midfield did not scream revolution. Or pace and intensity.\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nTalk about the dream start, an element of vindication, because it was Diallo who made the goal. He moved smartly through the gears up the right wing and, having slipped a tackle from Jens Cajuste, his low cross was made to measure for Rashford. The travelling United fans had chorused Amorim’s name after 30 seconds. They belted it out on loop for the next couple of minutes.\n\nIpswich stabilised. It was clear that Hutchinson had the beating of Casemiro and Jonny Evans, who played on the left of United’s back three. Hutchinson, in the right-sided No 10 role, was sharp with his turns and very quick.\n\nAmorim was a presence at the edge of his technical area. This is what coaching on the hoof looks like and it had to alarm him that United sank deeper. They looked to hurt Ipswich with long diagonal passes but it was the home team that took a grip on the midfield.\n\nThe equaliser had been advertised, André Onana busy in the United goal. He had pushed away a first-time hit from Sammie Szmodics in the 11th minute but the big save came in the countdown to half-time. Leif Davis stepped inside Diallo and he waited for the move of Liam Delap, putting the ball on a plate for him. Eight yards out, Delap put his foot through it only for Onana to throw out a big right hand, Peter Schmeichel-style, to block.\n\nUnited’s reprieve did not last long. Inevitably, it was Hutchinson, checking away from Casemiro on the right-hand edge of the area, quick feet to the fore. His curler flicked off Mazraoui’s head to deceive Onana on its way in.\n\nUnited pressed more on to the front foot after the restart, although they might have conceded when Delap tricked away from Matthijs de Ligt and surged through the middle. De Ligt looked awfully slow. Delap went right to Wes Burns and sprinted to meet the cross, his spectacular flick kept out by Onana.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho had worked Arijanet Muric from a tight angle at the start of the second half. And there was the moment on 54 minutes when he led a break with Rashford available inside for the pass, Cajuste the only Ipswich defender. Garnacho looked for Rashford; Cajuste made the crucial interception.\n\nAmorim searched for the solution. He got Luke Shaw on at left centre-half for his first football of the season, ordering him to stay close to Hutchinson. Manuel Ugarte replaced Casemiro. It was Rasmus Højlund for Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee was introduced in the right-sided No 10 role, Bruno Fernandes dropping back into midfield. There was a late sighting of Mason Mount, who came on for Garnacho.\n\nUnited could not make it happen. Fernandes curled a free-kick inches wide and it might have been worse for them if the Ipswich substitute, Conor Chaplin, had shot either side of Onana from a cross by another replacement, Jack Clarke. Not for the first time, Onana stood tall.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Or to last. There were 82 seconds on the stadium clock when the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United was jumpstarted. The new manager had put his faith in Marcus Rashford in the No 9 role and it was United’s great enigma who put them in front. Rashford charged about in the early running, a point to prove.\n\nAnd yet it was the prompt for a slow retreat by United for the remainder of the first half. The structure was different, United set up in Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations and faultlines from Erik ten Hag’s tenure. Control proved elusive. As it did so often under Ten Hag.\n\nIpswich were the better team before the interval and the excellent Omari Hutchinson got the goal they deserved before the end of it with a shot from distance that took a deflection off Noussair Mazraoui. Ipswich had won for the first time this season at Tottenham before the international break. This was in point-gained territory for them.\n\nNot so for United. After all of the talking and, goodness gracious, there has been some talking, Amorim’s arrival feeling like the coming of the messiah, it was time for United to fire some optimism. They could not do it. They were a bit better in the second period but not hugely and it looked as though the players had too much to process in terms of instructions. It all became stilted. Then again, as everyone knows, least of all Amorim, it will take time. He has only had two training sessions with the full squad.\n\nUnited had risen one place in the table on Saturday without playing – evidence, the club’s support hoped, of Amorim’s magic – and there was always going to be a spotlight on his first starting XI. Amorim talked on Friday about the need to “adapt some players” because he did not have the right profiles for his three-at-the-back system and there were a few square pegs in round holes, especially the left-footed attacking midfielder Amad Diallo at right wing-back.\n\nAmorim did not have three fit specialist centre-halves – there were four out with injuries – and so it was the full-back, Mazraoui, on the right of the back three. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in central midfield did not scream revolution. Or pace and intensity.\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nTalk about the dream start, an element of vindication, because it was Diallo who made the goal. He moved smartly through the gears up the right wing and, having slipped a tackle from Jens Cajuste, his low cross was made to measure for Rashford. The travelling United fans had chorused Amorim’s name after 30 seconds. They belted it out on loop for the next couple of minutes.\n\nIpswich stabilised. It was clear that Hutchinson had the beating of Casemiro and Jonny Evans, who played on the left of United’s back three. Hutchinson, in the right-sided No 10 role, was sharp with his turns and very quick.\n\nAmorim was a presence at the edge of his technical area. This is what coaching on the hoof looks like and it had to alarm him that United sank deeper. They looked to hurt Ipswich with long diagonal passes but it was the home team that took a grip on the midfield.\n\nThe equaliser had been advertised, André Onana busy in the United goal. He had pushed away a first-time hit from Sammie Szmodics in the 11th minute but the big save came in the countdown to half-time. Leif Davis stepped inside Diallo and he waited for the move of Liam Delap, putting the ball on a plate for him. Eight yards out, Delap put his foot through it only for Onana to throw out a big right hand, Peter Schmeichel-style, to block.\n\nUnited’s reprieve did not last long. Inevitably, it was Hutchinson, checking away from Casemiro on the right-hand edge of the area, quick feet to the fore. His curler flicked off Mazraoui’s head to deceive Onana on its way in.\n\nUnited pressed more on to the front foot after the restart, although they might have conceded when Delap tricked away from Matthijs de Ligt and surged through the middle. De Ligt looked awfully slow. Delap went right to Wes Burns and sprinted to meet the cross, his spectacular flick kept out by Onana.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho had worked Arijanet Muric from a tight angle at the start of the second half. And there was the moment on 54 minutes when he led a break with Rashford available inside for the pass, Cajuste the only Ipswich defender. Garnacho looked for Rashford; Cajuste made the crucial interception.\n\nAmorim searched for the solution. He got Luke Shaw on at left centre-half for his first football of the season, ordering him to stay close to Hutchinson. Manuel Ugarte replaced Casemiro. It was Rasmus Højlund for Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee was introduced in the right-sided No 10 role, Bruno Fernandes dropping back into midfield. There was a late sighting of Mason Mount, who came on for Garnacho.\n\nUnited could not make it happen. Fernandes curled a free-kick inches wide and it might have been worse for them if the Ipswich substitute, Conor Chaplin, had shot either side of Onana from a cross by another replacement, Jack Clarke. Not for the first time, Onana stood tall.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it in an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so. Instead the ball hits the post, inciting Warhurst to leap into a look-at-me-maturely-taking-charge-of-this clearance, slamming fresh air into Row Z before colliding with Palmer, the two collapsing into the net like Laurel and Hardy performing Swan Lake. This allows McClair to caress home a long-range special from two yards, posing in front of the United fans to accept their acclaim following yet another delicious finish from the master marksman. “What an extraordinary mess!” enthused John Helm in commentary. “It’s 2-1 to Manchester United and have you ever seen a sloppier goal than that!”\n\nEventually United tossed the title to Leeds, who won 6-1 when they visited Hillsborough a few months later. But just as that contest is now best remembered for Gordon Watson’s virtuoso dive, so McClair’s goal is eternal, existing beyond the confines of a game or season as paean to the absolute headfuck that is human existence.",

But somehow, the agglomeration of weird shapes and freaky textures that comprises us responds to instructions from the quivering lump of jelly that really comprises us, and thus does football eventuate. Jesse Armstrong once said that if a joke isn’t working, one thing to try is sticking it in an enclosed space so “the characters are up in each other’s physicality” and such is our beautiful game: a chaotic, hilarious gumbo of bodies controlled by brains that are fickle, stressed and distractible, having been socialised into the fanatical pursuit of an arbitrary aim to which has been ascribed inherent moral value.\n\nMany of the most preposterous events I’ve seen in my life have been football-related: consider John Terry arranging for himself to take a Champions League-winning penalty and adjusting his captain’s armband en route, then slipping and crying, or Steven Gerrard coming on for his last appearance against Manchester United after spending the entirety of the first half being wound up by the away end, then getting himself sent off 38 seconds later. For balance, I was also at the Stadium of Light on the last day of 2011-12, but we all have our own favourites: those moments when players, asked to process footballing obsession multiplied by the human condition, simply cannot.\n\nThere is no greater tribute to this nexus than the goal scored by Brian McClair at Sheffield Wednesday in October 1991. At the time, United were in the process of getting good – they’d won the FA Cup in 1990 and the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season – with McClair a crucial part of that success. Arriving from Celtic in the summer of 1987, he immediately removed one of two much-discussed millstones: he became the first United striker to score 20 league goals in a season since George Best in 1967-68. And what goals they were! With the notable exception of a beauty at home to Chelsea, rarely if ever has anyone assembled a greater succession of scuffs, taps and nods, guzzled with consummate alacrity.\n\nSo now for the second millstone: United had not won the league since 1966-67. They’d capitulated when well-placed at various points since then but never under Alex Ferguson, whose second place in McClair’s debut season was really a third place, behind Liverpool and daylight.\n\nNow, though, they were close to a proper team. Peter Schmeichel had arrived to shout at a settled back four featuring Paul Parker, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin; in midfield, Paul Ince was a dynamic and deceptively lanky presence, succeeding Bryan Robson as the league’s best midfielder while the man himself handled vigilante justice and referee liaison; on the wings, it was two of Lee Sharpe, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis; and up front, McClair was partnered by returned hero, Mark Hughes.\n\nSo United arrived at Hillsborough – an 80s bogey ground – top of the table, leading Leeds by two points with a game in hand and the only team in the country still unbeaten. Wednesday, though, were handy. Just six months earlier, they’d beaten United to lift the Rumbelows Cup – a match also famous for Les Sealey’s flesh wound – which remains the last time a top division team lost a final to one from below.\n\nWednesday’s manager that day was Ron Atkinson who, when at United, saw his table-topping side concede a goal almost as beautiful as ours on the same day in 1985. But after leading Wednesday to promotion, he nipped off to Villa having promised to the contrary, so Trevor Francis came in and took the side to fifth in the table.\n\nAnd what a squad Wednesday had, led by their captain Nigel Pearson – imagine, he’s mellowed with age! – while alongside him was the solidity of Roland Nilsson, the elegance of Viv Anderson and the Fantasy League legend Paul Warhurst. Then, in midfield, there was the avant-garde grace of Carlton Palmer, the tiny-footed exuberance of the late Chris Bart-Williams and the improvisational invention of John Sheridan. These were skills he would later deploy to great effect as Stockport manager when, displeased by the work of the referee Eddie Ilderton, he told him: “You’re a fucking disgrace, you’re fucking useless, you’ve not fucking got anything right today, you should be fucking ashamed, you’re fucking shit, my kids aren’t going to get any fucking Christmas presents because of fucking you.”\n\nUp front, meanwhile, Nigel Jemson partnered the long-time United target David Hirst. Indeed, Francis later earned the rich, rare reward of a hairdryer for his effrontery in refusing to sell him to United, Fergie eventually consoling himself with the Wednesday reject Eric Cantona.\n\nAnd Hirst, who scored seven career goals against United, was quickly involved, diddling Robson and Parker with a lovely turn before botching his shot. But on 14 minutes he gave Wednesday the lead, a terrific header converting Nigel Worthington’s fine cross.\n\nRobson then autographed Palmer’s leg – in fairness, he couldn’t really miss – before United quickly drew level. A dreadful back pass from Warhurst played in McClair, and the Mozart of the snot rocket eased a first-time finish past Chris Woods in front of a pogoing away end.\n\nThen, five minutes later, it happens. Parker comes in on Hirst from behind and clips a pass infield under which McClair ducks, allowing Giggs, back to goal, to tee up Robson – bursting into the box like he’s on Baywatch – with a cute pass into stride. So far, so normal. But after Robson takes his touch, he swivels into a shot, the delay on which causes Anderson to slide in with nothing to block. Palmer, though, in the course of running past the ball, somehow does get in the road, the ball rearing up before Robson – the first to react – seeks to swipe square for McClair. But like a many-tentacled monster emerging from the ground, Anderson extends a telescopic limb while Nilsson, desperate, lunges towards his own net, diverting the ball away from the diving Woods and sending it dribbling goalwards with such emphatic, pathetic finality that both McClair and Irwin raise arms, anticipating an own goal of affirming ineptitude.\n\nNot so.

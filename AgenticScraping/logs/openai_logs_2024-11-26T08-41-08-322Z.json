Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n6.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

The 39-year-old striker faces an increasingly uncertain future in the Middle East, with [his contract at Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of the season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sergio-aguero-makes-man-united-30445126).\\n\\nRonaldo, who was released by [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) back in November 2022, has featured 10 times in the Saudi Pro League this season, scoring 10 goals and providing two assists. Playing a key role in Stefano Pioli's side, [the Portugal international has fired Al-Nassr to third in the table](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792).\\n\\nDespite his impressive performances, he's yet to be awarded an extension, making him available on a free transfer in the summer. According to Turkish outlet [Fotomac](https://www.fotomac.com.tr/fenerbahce/2024/11/21/fenerbahceden-dunyayi-sarsacak-ronaldo-hamlesi-iste-cilgin-plan?paging=10) last week, [Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\\\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\\\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \\\"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\\\"\\n\\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\\n\\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters after Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland, as quoted by [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/uefa-nations-league/2024-2025/cristiano-ronaldo-retirement-dismisses-coaching-management-portugal-al-nassr-bicycle-kick_sto20054667/story.shtml), Ronaldo said: \\\"Plan for retirement? If it has to happen, in one or two years. I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon. I really want to enjoy \\\\[it\\\\], as long as I feel motivated, I keep going.\\n\\n\\\"The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\\\"\\n\\nMourinho managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. They won the LaLiga title in 2011-12 and the Copa del Rey the year before.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The 39-year-old striker faces an increasingly uncertain future in the Middle East, with [his contract at Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of the season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sergio-aguero-makes-man-united-30445126).\\n\\nRonaldo, who was released by [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) back in November 2022, has featured 10 times in the Saudi Pro League this season, scoring 10 goals and providing two assists. Playing a key role in Stefano Pioli's side, [the Portugal international has fired Al-Nassr to third in the table](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792).\\n\\nDespite his impressive performances, he's yet to be awarded an extension, making him available on a free transfer in the summer. According to Turkish outlet [Fotomac](https://www.fotomac.com.tr/fenerbahce/2024/11/21/fenerbahceden-dunyayi-sarsacak-ronaldo-hamlesi-iste-cilgin-plan?paging=10) last week, [Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\\\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\\\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \\\"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\\\"\\n\\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\\n\\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters after Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland, as quoted by [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/uefa-nations-league/2024-2025/cristiano-ronaldo-retirement-dismisses-coaching-management-portugal-al-nassr-bicycle-kick_sto20054667/story.shtml), Ronaldo said: \\\"Plan for retirement? If it has to happen, in one or two years. I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon. I really want to enjoy \\\\[it\\\\], as long as I feel motivated, I keep going.\\n\\n\\\"The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\\\"\\n\\nMourinho managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013.

The 39-year-old striker faces an increasingly uncertain future in the Middle East, with [his contract at Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of the season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sergio-aguero-makes-man-united-30445126).\\n\\nRonaldo, who was released by [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) back in November 2022, has featured 10 times in the Saudi Pro League this season, scoring 10 goals and providing two assists. Playing a key role in Stefano Pioli's side, [the Portugal international has fired Al-Nassr to third in the table](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792).\\n\\nDespite his impressive performances, he's yet to be awarded an extension, making him available on a free transfer in the summer. According to Turkish outlet [Fotomac](https://www.fotomac.com.tr/fenerbahce/2024/11/21/fenerbahceden-dunyayi-sarsacak-ronaldo-hamlesi-iste-cilgin-plan?paging=10) last week, [Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\\\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\\\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \\\"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\\\"\\n\\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\\n\\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters after Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland, as quoted by [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/uefa-nations-league/2024-2025/cristiano-ronaldo-retirement-dismisses-coaching-management-portugal-al-nassr-bicycle-kick_sto20054667/story.shtml), Ronaldo said: \\\"Plan for retirement? If it has to happen, in one or two years. I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon. I really want to enjoy \\\\[it\\\\], as long as I feel motivated, I keep going.\\n\\n\\\"The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\\\"\\n\\nMourinho managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. They won the LaLiga title in 2011-12 and the Copa del Rey the year before.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

According to Turkish outlet [Fotomac](https://www.fotomac.com.tr/fenerbahce/2024/11/21/fenerbahceden-dunyayi-sarsacak-ronaldo-hamlesi-iste-cilgin-plan?paging=10) last week, [Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\\\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\\\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \\\"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\\\"\\n\\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\\n\\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and [interest Geovany Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/geovany-quenda-transfer-latest-man-30420012) are out of the question.\\n\\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day.

Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\\n\\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing.\\n\\n> \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\\\" he told BBC Sport. \\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n> \\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\n> \\n> \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2](internal:/article/30426263)\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n08:03Bruna Reis\\n\\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\\n\\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\\n\\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services.

The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\\n\\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer.

Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\\n\\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing.\\n\\n> \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\\\" he told BBC Sport. \\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n> \\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\n> \\n> \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer.

Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\\n\\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing.\\n\\n> \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\\\" he told BBC Sport. \\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n> \\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\n> \\n> \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2](internal:/article/30426263)\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n08:03Bruna Reis\\n\\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\\n\\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\\n\\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea. He did a great job.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment13](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Amad Diallo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo)\\n*   [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

\\\"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis).\\n\\n\\\"So it’s like a winger follows the left back. It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n08:24 Bruna Reis\n\n### Kobbie Mainoo theory\n\nDanny Murphy has suggested that Kobbie Mainoo could have no future at Manchester United following the arrival of Ruben Amorim.\n\nMainoo returned to the matchday squad for Ipswich Town but wasn't among the five substitutes brought on by Amorim. Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\n\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing. \n\n\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\n\n08:03 Bruna Reis\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\n\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers. \n\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services. It's said that Juve is the 'ideal destination' for the Dutch as he would have the opportunity to reunite with his former manager Thiago Motta.\n\n07:46 Bruna Reis\n\n### Ruben Amorim wish\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. \n\nThe article claims that United will face competition from Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande. It has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n07:42 Bruna Reis\n\n### Rayan Ait-Nouri 'interest'\n\nThe Sun reports Wolves' Rayan Ait-Nouri is 'high on the wishlist' of Ruben Amorim. \n\nThe Portuguese manager is said to want to reinforce his options given Luke Shaw's injury record. There is a possibility that Shaw could also eventually move into the back-three once Amorim fully instils his 3-4-3 system at the club. \n\nAit-Nouri, an attacking wing-back, is believed to tick all of the boxes for Amorim and the style of the football he likes to play. He has also been linked with a move to Liverpool.\n\n07:39 Bruna Reis\n\n### Geovany Quenda 'approach'\n\nPortuguese news outlet A Bola claims Man United have intensified their interest in signing Geovany Quenda ahead of the transfer window. \n\nThe report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach. It has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. \n\nThe 17-year-old forward has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\n\n07:29 Bruna Reis\n\n### Good morning Reds fans!\n\nHello and welcome to our Man United live blog.  \n\nWe will keep you up to date with all things United throughout the day.\n\n22:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Ex-United men in the running for Premier League return\n\nWhile United fans were focused on Amorim's debut, Leicester City were making the decision to part ways with Steve Cooper.\n\nThe Foxes lost 2-1 to Chelsea at the weekend and sit 16th in the Premier League table - just a solitary point above the drop zone.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a number of ex-United men are being linked with the vacancy at the King Power Stadium. \n\n22:30 Jack Flintham\n\n### Why Keane confronted me in a car park\n\nAn Ipswich fan, who alleges to have been challenged to a confrontation by Roy Keane, has disclosed the cause of the heated altercation with Manchester United's ex-captain. \n\nNeil Finbow, an Ipswich supporter, has taken to social media claiming to be one of the fans confronted by Keane.  \n\n21:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Keane involved in furious confrontation\n\nIt wasn't just Amorim who was feeling annoyed after the draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nKeane was seen in a furious confrontation with Ipswich fans at the final whistle with the former United captain telling them to wait for him in the car park.\n\n21:33 Jack Flintham\n\n### Sheeran under fire after interrupting Amorim\n\nMusic superstar and sponsor of Ipswich Town, Ed Sheeran found himself in hot water with United fans yesterday as he inadvertently interrupted Amorim's interview with Sky Sports.\n\nSheeran's arrival broke up the segment and left United fans fuming as their new boss was left standing awkwardly as Jamie Redknapp spoke with the A-Team singer. \n\n21:07 Jack Flintham\n\n### Good evening\n\nHello and welcome to the United transfer blog.  \n\nMy name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the evening bringing you all the updates on United in the aftermath of the 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town. \n\n20:30 Isaac Seelochan\n\n### Dalot reveals Amorim instructions\n\nDiogo Dalot started at left wing-back during yesterday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town and revealed the specific instructions he was given by Ruben Amorim. \n\nHe said: \"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for everybody and he wants us to have more control of the games.\"  \n\n20:07 Isaac Seelochan\n\n### McKenna praises Amorim tactical change\n\nKieran McKenna admitted Ipswich Town were challenged by Ruben Amorim's tactical changes. \n\nAmorim's success as a head coach has been underpinned by his 3-4-3 formation and he had limited time training at Carrington to prepare the players to face Ipswich at Portman Road. \n\n19:34 Isaac Seelochan\n\n### Ruud next job stance\n\nFormer Manchester United striker and coach Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly ready to immediately step into a head coach role after his exit from the club and has already been linked to two vacant jobs.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n08:03 Bruna Reis\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\n\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\n\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services. It's said that Juve is the 'ideal destination' for the Dutch as he would have the opportunity to reunite with his former manager Thiago Motta.\n\n![Image 2](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30424364.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_GettyImages-2182072811.jpg)\n\nJoshua Zirkzee moved to Manchester United in the summer from Bologna (Image: Michael Regan)\n\n07:46 Bruna Reis\n\n### Ruben Amorim wish\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford.\n\nThe article claims that United will face competition from Chelsea, Manchester City, and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande. It has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n07:42 Bruna Reis\n\n### Rayan Ait-Nouri 'interest'\n\nThe Sun reports Wolves' Rayan Ait-Nouri is 'high on the wishlist' of Ruben Amorim.\n\nThe Portuguese manager is said to want to reinforce his options give Luke Shaw's injury record. There is a possibility that Shaw could also eventually move into the back-three once Amorim fully instils his 3-4-3 system at the club.\n\n07:39 Bruna Reis\n\n### Geovany Quenda 'approach'\n\nPortuguese news outlet A Bola claims Man United have intensified their interest in signing Geovany Quenda ahead of the transfer window.\n\nThe report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach. It has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. The 17-year-old forward has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\n\n07:29 Bruna Reis\n\n### Good morning Reds fans!\n\nHello and welcome to our Man United live blog.\n\nWe will keep you up to date with all things United throughout the day.\n\n22:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Ex-United men in the running for Premier League return\n\nWhile United fans were focused on Amorim's debut, Leicester City were making the decision to part ways with Steve Cooper.\n\n22:30 Jack Flintham\n\n### Why Keane confronted me in a car park\n\nAn Ipswich fan, who alleges to have been challenged to a confrontation by Roy Keane, has disclosed the cause of the heated altercation with Manchester United's ex-captain.\n\nNeil Finbow, an Ipswich supporter, has taken to social media claiming to be one of the fans confronted by Keane.\n\n> New claim to fame just been offered out into the carpark by Roy Keane after a few choice words even Jamie Redknapp had to come over to get him away just ya average Sunday evening out.\n\nAdding further context, Finbow said:\n\n> Yep did remind him he set us back five years and ruined our football club - I also mentioned he wasn't fit to step foot anywhere near our ground.\n\n21:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Keane involved in furious confrontation\n\nIt wasn't just Amorim who was feeling annoyed after the draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nKeane was seen in a furious confrontation with Ipswich fans at the final whistle with the former United captain telling them to wait for him in the car park.\n\n21:33 Jack Flintham\n\n### Sheeran underfire after interrupting Amorim\n\nMusic superstar and sponsor of Ipswich Town, Ed Sheeran found himself in hot water with United fans yesterday as he inadvertently interrupted Amorim's interview with Sky Sports.\n\nSheeran's arrival broke up the segment and left United fans fuming as their new boss was left standing awkwardly as Jamie Redknapp spoke with the A-Team singer.\n\nSince that moment, Sheeran has issued an apology.\n\n15:48 Kieran Horn\n\n### Amorim reveals love for Ten Hag signing\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has heaped praise on Noussair Mazraoui for his performance on the right of a back three against Ipswich Town.\n\n\"Mazraoui is so smart,\" Amorim told Premier League Productions. \"I think Mazraoui is so important for us, he can play anywhere. That kind of player is so crucial for our future.\"\n\nRuben Amorim faces a huge challenge to turn Manchester United around after a decade of struggle with a team underperforming.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 39-year-old striker faces an increasingly uncertain future in the Middle East, with his contract at Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of the season.\n\nRonaldo, who was released by Manchester United back in November 2022, has featured 10 times in the Saudi Pro League this season, scoring 10 goals and providing two assists. Playing a key role in Stefano Pioli's side, the Portugal international has fired Al-Nassr to third in the table.\n\nDespite his impressive performances, he's yet to be awarded an extension, making him available on a free transfer in the summer. According to Turkish outlet Fotomac last week, Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe.\n\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\n\n\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\" said Mourinho, who proceeded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\"\n\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\n\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland, as quoted by TNT Sports, Ronaldo said: \"Plan for retirement? If it has to happen, in one or two years. I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon. I really want to enjoy it, as long as I feel motivated, I keep going.\n\n\"The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\"\n\nMourinho managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. They won the LaLiga title in 2011-12 and the Copa del Rey the year before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\n\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\n\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\"\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\n\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\" Amorim admitted. \"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea. He did a great job.\"\n**READ NEXT:**\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United]\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny]\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim expressed his satisfaction with Amad's swift defensive improvement after the 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town. The 22-year-old started on the right wing in United's 3-4-3 formation and impressively assisted Marcus Rashford's goal after only 80 seconds. Amorim had indicated on Friday that he would select full backs in the wide roles but United were without four senior centre backs, so right back Noussair Mazraoui lined up in their back three. Amad started in caretaker manager Ruud van Nistelrooy's final two matches in charge and retained his place under the incumbent United coach. \"I think it was very good, he has improved a lot,\" Amorim said of Amad. \"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis). \"So it’s like a winger follows the left back.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n08:03 Bruna Reis\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\n\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\n\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services. It's said that Juve is the 'ideal destination' for the Dutch as he would have the opportunity to reunite with his former manager Thiago Motta.\n\n![Image 2](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30424364.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_GettyImages-2182072811.jpg)\n\nJoshua Zirkzee moved to Manchester United in the summer from Bologna (Image: Michael Regan)\n\n07:46 Bruna Reis\n\n### Ruben Amorim wish\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford.\n\nThe article claims that United will face competition from Chelsea, Manchester City, and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande. It has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n07:42 Bruna Reis\n\n### Rayan Ait-Nouri 'interest'\n\nThe Sun reports Wolves' Rayan Ait-Nouri is 'high on the wishlist' of Ruben Amorim.\n\nThe Portuguese manager is said to want to reinforce his options give Luke Shaw's injury record. There is a possibility that Shaw could also eventually move into the back-three once Amorim fully instils his 3-4-3 system at the club.\n\n07:39 Bruna Reis\n\n### Geovany Quenda 'approach'\n\nPortuguese news outlet A Bola claims Man United have intensified their interest in signing Geovany Quenda ahead of the transfer window.\n\nThe report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach. It has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. The 17-year-old forward has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\n\n07:29 Bruna Reis\n\n### Good morning Reds fans!\n\nHello and welcome to our Man United live blog.\n\nWe will keep you up to date with all things United throughout the day.\n\n22:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Ex-United men in the running for Premier League return\n\nWhile United fans were focused on Amorim's debut, Leicester City were making the decision to part ways with Steve Cooper.\n\n22:30 Jack Flintham\n\n### Why Keane confronted me in a car park\n\nAn Ipswich fan, who alleges to have been challenged to a confrontation by Roy Keane, has disclosed the cause of the heated altercation with Manchester United's ex-captain.\n\nNeil Finbow, an Ipswich supporter, has taken to social media claiming to be one of the fans confronted by Keane.\n\n> New claim to fame just been offered out into the carpark by Roy Keane after a few choice words even Jamie Redknapp had to come over to get him away just ya average Sunday evening out.\n\nAdding further context, Finbow said:\n\n> Yep did remind him he set us back five years and ruined our football club - I also mentioned he wasn't fit to step foot anywhere near our ground.\n\n21:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Keane involved in furious confrontation\n\nIt wasn't just Amorim who was feeling annoyed after the draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nKeane was seen in a furious confrontation with Ipswich fans at the final whistle with the former United captain telling them to wait for him in the car park.\n\n21:33 Jack Flintham\n\n### Sheeran underfire after interrupting Amorim\n\nMusic superstar and sponsor of Ipswich Town, Ed Sheeran found himself in hot water with United fans yesterday as he inadvertently interrupted Amorim's interview with Sky Sports.\n\nSheeran's arrival broke up the segment and left United fans fuming as their new boss was left standing awkwardly as Jamie Redknapp spoke with the A-Team singer.\n\nSince that moment, Sheeran has issued an apology.\n\n15:48 Kieran Horn\n\n### Amorim reveals love for Ten Hag signing\n\nManchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has heaped praise on Noussair Mazraoui for his performance on the right of a back three against Ipswich Town.\n\n\"Mazraoui is so smart,\" Amorim told Premier League Productions. \"I think Mazraoui is so important for us, he can play anywhere. That kind of player is so crucial for our future.\"\n\nRuben Amorim faces a huge challenge to turn Manchester United around after a decade of struggle with a team underperforming.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

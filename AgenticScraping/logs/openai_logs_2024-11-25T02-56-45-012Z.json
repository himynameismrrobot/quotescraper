We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

IT’S OUTSIDE THE BOX,\" while another commented: \"It’s just inside and Robertson’s foot was on the line when the foul happened.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"We just watched Michael Oliver literally watch that player dive and dive outside the box and recommend a penalty. What a scam.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"So, apparently, if you foul someone outside the box and you’re wearing a Liverpool jersey, that’s now a penalty,\" and a fifth added: \"How exactly is that a penalty against Liverpool? The tackle was outside the box, not inside.\"\n\nSouthampton striker Adam Armstrong went on to equalise for Russell Martin's side after he converted the rebound from Caoimhin Kelleher's initial save from 12 yards.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

IT’S OUTSIDE THE BOX,\" while another commented: \"It’s just inside and Robertson’s foot was on the line when the foul happened.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"We just watched Michael Oliver literally watch that player dive and dive outside the box and recommend a penalty. What a scam.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"So, apparently, if you foul someone outside the box and you’re wearing a Liverpool jersey, that’s now a penalty,\" and a fifth added: \"How exactly is that a penalty against Liverpool? The tackle was outside the box, not inside.\"\n\nSouthampton striker Adam Armstrong went on to equalise for Russell Martin's side after he converted the rebound from Caoimhin Kelleher's initial save from 12 yards.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\\\"\\n\\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\\n\\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\\n\\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\\n\\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \\\"hi guys\\\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\\n\\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\\n\\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things.

I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard.

I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us.

But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\\\"\\n\\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\\n\\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\\n\\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\\n\\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \\\"hi guys\\\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\\n\\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\\n\\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis.

But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955\",\"article_headline\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'\",\"article_text\":\"Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season' - Manchester Evening News\\n\\nThe latest Manchester United news as the full-back has responded to Jesse Lingard after his first season with South Korean side FC Seoul\\n\\nBy\\n\\nAmie Wilson\\n\\n09:19, 24 NOV 2024\\n\\nManchester United full-back Luke Shaw has showed his support to former teammate Jesse Lingard after the end of his first season with FC Seoul.\\n\\nLingard joined the South Korean side at the start of February, in what was a surprise move.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis.

But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis.

I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, along with David Moyes at Everton in March 2002.\n\nHowever, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\nWere you at the game or following from elsewhere?\n\n**Dan Roan**, Sports editor: This was a highly accomplished and assured first media conference by Ruben Amorim, whose confidence was immediately apparent as he strode purposefully into a packed room at Carrington with a smile and \"hi guys\" to the assembled journalists, before fielding a host of questions from both English and Portuguese reporters.\n\nThis felt very different to the strained and adversarial media conferences that became a weekly feature of the final months of Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Amorim seemed to relish the opportunity to articulate how he is feeling. Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\n\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\n\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\n\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-united\",\"article_headline\":\"BBC Manchester United Homepage\",\"article_text\":\"**Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport**: \\\"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity.

Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \\\"the right guy at the right moment\\\". He has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve. He has also given a reality check about the plans to put in place and the improvement that is required.\\n\\nAs the first managerial hire since Ineos took over the football operations at Old Trafford, a lot is resting on his shoulders. It was noticeable that Tom Crotty, a senior director at the petrochemicals company and a trusted advisor to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, was in attendance.\\n\\nHowever, if the coach was feeling the pressure that comes with that, and from being in one of the most scrutinised coaching roles in world football, he did not show it. At the end, Amorim embraced several Portuguese reporters who had travelled here to cover his first media appearance. Whether he forges such close bonds with their British counterparts remains to be seen. But based on this first performance, communication will not be a problem for the coach.\\n\\n**New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality.**\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\\n\\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\\n\\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\\n\\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\\n\\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\\n\\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \\\"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\\n\\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red heart emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\\n\\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going.

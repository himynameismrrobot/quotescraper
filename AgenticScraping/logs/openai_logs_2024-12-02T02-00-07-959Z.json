The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 54: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

He has to continue to improve.\\n\\n\\\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \\\"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus \\\\[Hojlund\\\\], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \\\"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\\\" said Amorim about potential [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) qualification.\\n\\n\\\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results.

But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends clear message to Ruben Amorim after Man United demand](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends Arsenal warning ahead of Man United clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \\\"We keep going,\\\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\\\" alongside a love heart emoji.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\\n\\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he is also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\\\"\\n\\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) matches so far this season.\\n\\n\\\"It was far from a perfect performance,\\\" Amorim added. \\\"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

It was the United boss who signed him from Coventry back in the summer of 2023, and he has already scored over 60 goals for Sporting across all competitions in just a season and a half.\\n\\nGyokeres' inspired form in front of goal has made him a transfer target for a number of top European clubs, including United and [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc). Some reports suggest [he has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-heart-set-one-30473775), although he is seemingly in no rush to leave his current club.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give Manchester United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim gives Tyrell Malacia verdict and provides Manchester United injury update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Swedish outlet Fotbollskanalen, Gyokeres said: \\\"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to. It's just rumours, nothing concrete.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I'm enjoying my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\\\"\\n\\nThat will come as disappointing news for United fans, with the club lacking a clinical striker, despite the arrival of [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) from Bologna over the summer. However, it's worth noting Amorim, too, initially wanted to remain at Sporting until the end of the season.\\n\\nIn one of his final press conferences as manager of Sporting, Amorim told the media: \\\"I had three days to decide one option that radically changes my life.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"The only request I made was for it \\\\[transfer\\\\] to be at the end of the season, and they \\\\[United\\\\] told me that it wasn't possible; that it was now or never. I knew if I rejected it that in six months I wouldn't have it. And I knew that in six months I would know that I wouldn't be at Sporting.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's insistence they would not wait ultimately forced through the move and ensured they landed their primary managerial target. As United desperately need to close the gap on the top four, supporters will hope they can pull off a similar trick to beat their rivals to Gyokeres' signature in the upcoming transfer windows.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

It was the United boss who signed him from Coventry back in the summer of 2023, and he has already scored over 60 goals for Sporting across all competitions in just a season and a half.\\n\\nGyokeres' inspired form in front of goal has made him a transfer target for a number of top European clubs, including United and [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc). Some reports suggest [he has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-heart-set-one-30473775), although he is seemingly in no rush to leave his current club.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give Manchester United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim gives Tyrell Malacia verdict and provides Manchester United injury update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Swedish outlet Fotbollskanalen, Gyokeres said: \\\"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to. It's just rumours, nothing concrete.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I'm enjoying my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\\\"\\n\\nThat will come as disappointing news for United fans, with the club lacking a clinical striker, despite the arrival of [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) from Bologna over the summer. However, it's worth noting Amorim, too, initially wanted to remain at Sporting until the end of the season.\\n\\nIn one of his final press conferences as manager of Sporting, Amorim told the media: \\\"I had three days to decide one option that radically changes my life.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"The only request I made was for it \\\\[transfer\\\\] to be at the end of the season, and they \\\\[United\\\\] told me that it wasn't possible; that it was now or never. I knew if I rejected it that in six months I wouldn't have it. And I knew that in six months I would know that I wouldn't be at Sporting.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's insistence they would not wait ultimately forced through the move and ensured they landed their primary managerial target. As United desperately need to close the gap on the top four, supporters will hope they can pull off a similar trick to beat their rivals to Gyokeres' signature in the upcoming transfer windows.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

It was the United boss who signed him from Coventry back in the summer of 2023, and he has already scored over 60 goals for Sporting across all competitions in just a season and a half.\\n\\nGyokeres' inspired form in front of goal has made him a transfer target for a number of top European clubs, including United and [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc). Some reports suggest [he has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-heart-set-one-30473775), although he is seemingly in no rush to leave his current club.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give Manchester United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim gives Tyrell Malacia verdict and provides Manchester United injury update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Swedish outlet Fotbollskanalen, Gyokeres said: \\\"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to. It's just rumours, nothing concrete.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I'm enjoying my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\\\"\\n\\nThat will come as disappointing news for United fans, with the club lacking a clinical striker, despite the arrival of [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) from Bologna over the summer. However, it's worth noting Amorim, too, initially wanted to remain at Sporting until the end of the season.\\n\\nIn one of his final press conferences as manager of Sporting, Amorim told the media: \\\"I had three days to decide one option that radically changes my life.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"The only request I made was for it \\\\[transfer\\\\] to be at the end of the season, and they \\\\[United\\\\] told me that it wasn't possible; that it was now or never.

It was the United boss who signed him from Coventry back in the summer of 2023, and he has already scored over 60 goals for Sporting across all competitions in just a season and a half.\\n\\nGyokeres' inspired form in front of goal has made him a transfer target for a number of top European clubs, including United and [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc). Some reports suggest [he has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-heart-set-one-30473775), although he is seemingly in no rush to leave his current club.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give Manchester United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim gives Tyrell Malacia verdict and provides Manchester United injury update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nIn a recent interview with Swedish outlet Fotbollskanalen, Gyokeres said: \\\"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to. It's just rumours, nothing concrete.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I'm enjoying my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\\\"\\n\\nThat will come as disappointing news for United fans, with the club lacking a clinical striker, despite the arrival of [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) from Bologna over the summer. However, it's worth noting Amorim, too, initially wanted to remain at Sporting until the end of the season.\\n\\nIn one of his final press conferences as manager of Sporting, Amorim told the media: \\\"I had three days to decide one option that radically changes my life.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"The only request I made was for it \\\\[transfer\\\\] to be at the end of the season, and they \\\\[United\\\\] told me that it wasn't possible; that it was now or never. I knew if I rejected it that in six months I wouldn't have it. And I knew that in six months I would know that I wouldn't be at Sporting.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's insistence they would not wait ultimately forced through the move and ensured they landed their primary managerial target. As United desperately need to close the gap on the top four, supporters will hope they can pull off a similar trick to beat their rivals to Gyokeres' signature in the upcoming transfer windows.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

With United looking to bolster their attack, the latest name to be linked with the Reds is [Osimhen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/victor-osimhen).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United face up to alarming £43m transfer reality](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-face-up-alarming-30488118)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim gives Malacia verdict](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nThe Nigerian was previously a target under [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) but United were unable to afford him at the time. However, a move never materialised in the summer and Osimhen was shipped out on loan to Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIt is believed a break clause was included in the loan to allow Osimhen to join one of ten top European clubs. It is unclear whether United are one of them.\\n\\nAccording to [Area Napoli](https://www.areanapoli.it/calciomercato/il-mattino---manchester-united-offerto-un-esubero-da-40-milioni-per-osimhen_572848.html), [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are looking to kill two birds with one stone by organising a swap deal with the Naples club. United are thought to be ready to offer £33.2m plus Zirkzee for the talented striker - taking the value of the swap to around £69m.\\n\\nSince moving to Turkey, Osimhen has bagged eight goals across 11 appearances. Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven's attacking midfielder Malik Tillman is also thought to be on United's wishlist for January.\\n\\nThe attacking midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie this season with eight goals and four assists to his name in 19 appearances. However, the former Bayern Munich man's form has not gone unnoticed in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).\\n\\nWhile United are believed to be interested, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc) and [Aston Villa](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc) are also thought to be keen. Tillman is believed to favour a move to the Premier League but the Reds would need to splash as much as £33m to bag him this winter.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

With United looking to bolster their attack, the latest name to be linked with the Reds is [Osimhen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/victor-osimhen).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United face up to alarming £43m transfer reality](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-face-up-alarming-30488118)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim gives Malacia verdict](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nThe Nigerian was previously a target under [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) but United were unable to afford him at the time. However, a move never materialised in the summer and Osimhen was shipped out on loan to Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIt is believed a break clause was included in the loan to allow Osimhen to join one of ten top European clubs. It is unclear whether United are one of them.\\n\\nAccording to [Area Napoli](https://www.areanapoli.it/calciomercato/il-mattino---manchester-united-offerto-un-esubero-da-40-milioni-per-osimhen_572848.html), [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are looking to kill two birds with one stone by organising a swap deal with the Naples club. United are thought to be ready to offer £33.2m plus Zirkzee for the talented striker - taking the value of the swap to around £69m.\\n\\nSince moving to Turkey, Osimhen has bagged eight goals across 11 appearances. Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven's attacking midfielder Malik Tillman is also thought to be on United's wishlist for January.\\n\\nThe attacking midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie this season with eight goals and four assists to his name in 19 appearances. However, the former Bayern Munich man's form has not gone unnoticed in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).\\n\\nWhile United are believed to be interested, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc) and [Aston Villa](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc) are also thought to be keen. Tillman is believed to favour a move to the Premier League but the Reds would need to splash as much as £33m to bag him this winter.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

With United looking to bolster their attack, the latest name to be linked with the Reds is [Osimhen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/victor-osimhen).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United face up to alarming £43m transfer reality](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-face-up-alarming-30488118)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim gives Malacia verdict](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nThe Nigerian was previously a target under [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) but United were unable to afford him at the time. However, a move never materialised in the summer and Osimhen was shipped out on loan to Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIt is believed a break clause was included in the loan to allow Osimhen to join one of ten top European clubs. It is unclear whether United are one of them.\\n\\nAccording to [Area Napoli](https://www.areanapoli.it/calciomercato/il-mattino---manchester-united-offerto-un-esubero-da-40-milioni-per-osimhen_572848.html), [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are looking to kill two birds with one stone by organising a swap deal with the Naples club. United are thought to be ready to offer £33.2m plus Zirkzee for the talented striker - taking the value of the swap to around £69m.\\n\\nSince moving to Turkey, Osimhen has bagged eight goals across 11 appearances. Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven's attacking midfielder Malik Tillman is also thought to be on United's wishlist for January.\\n\\nThe attacking midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie this season with eight goals and four assists to his name in 19 appearances. However, the former Bayern Munich man's form has not gone unnoticed in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).\\n\\nWhile United are believed to be interested, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc) and [Aston Villa](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc) are also thought to be keen. Tillman is believed to favour a move to the Premier League but the Reds would need to splash as much as £33m to bag him this winter.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

With United looking to bolster their attack, the latest name to be linked with the Reds is [Osimhen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/victor-osimhen).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United face up to alarming £43m transfer reality](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-face-up-alarming-30488118)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim gives Malacia verdict](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-gives-tyrell-malacia-30487790)**\\n\\nThe Nigerian was previously a target under [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) but United were unable to afford him at the time. However, a move never materialised in the summer and Osimhen was shipped out on loan to Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIt is believed a break clause was included in the loan to allow Osimhen to join one of ten top European clubs. It is unclear whether United are one of them.\\n\\nAccording to [Area Napoli](https://www.areanapoli.it/calciomercato/il-mattino---manchester-united-offerto-un-esubero-da-40-milioni-per-osimhen_572848.html), [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are looking to kill two birds with one stone by organising a swap deal with the Naples club. United are thought to be ready to offer £33.2m plus Zirkzee for the talented striker - taking the value of the swap to around £69m.\\n\\nSince moving to Turkey, Osimhen has bagged eight goals across 11 appearances. Elsewhere, PSV Eindhoven's attacking midfielder Malik Tillman is also thought to be on United's wishlist for January.\\n\\nThe attacking midfielder has impressed in the Eredivisie this season with eight goals and four assists to his name in 19 appearances. However, the former Bayern Munich man's form has not gone unnoticed in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).\\n\\nWhile United are believed to be interested, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc) and [Aston Villa](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc) are also thought to be keen. Tillman is believed to favour a move to the Premier League but the Reds would need to splash as much as £33m to bag him this winter.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The result moved United up into the top half of the Premier League table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\n\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the Erik ten Hag era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\n\nKeane picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City’s defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League. \"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals [is impressive],\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\n\n\"Whatever the problems United have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\n\n\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\"\n\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    [\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Roy Keane\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"[Regarding United's scoring performance] Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals [is impressive],\",\n    \"summary\": \"I find it impressive that they scored four goals with the strikers scoring.\",\n    \"id\": \"d0f74542-34a6-496d-865f-70c4a4230ed1\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Roy Keane\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"[On United's previous struggles] Whatever the problems United have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton...

He has to continue to improve.\n\n\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\"\n\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\" he said.\n\n\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus \\[Hojlund\\], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\n\n\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\"\n\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\" said Amorim about potential [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) qualification.\n\n\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\n\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\n\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\n\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \"We keep going,\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\" alongside a love heart emoji.\n\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\n\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\"\n\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the Champions League places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 Premier League matches so far this season.\n\n\"It was far from a perfect performance,\" Amorim added. \"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    [\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Amad Diallo\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"[After the game] We keep going, thanks fans for the support.\",\n    \"summary\": \"I appreciate the fans' support and let's keep pushing forward.\",\n    \"id\": \"fb2e523c-cc43-4056-bd3f-63412c17a829\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Ruben Amorim\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"He is really big in talent, but small in size.

Ahead of the first home league game of the Amorim era, here's a look at the latest United headlines.\n\n**READ MORE:** **[United supporters group announce ticket price protest ahead of Everton fixture](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-supporters-group-announce-30461312)**\n\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\n\n### Obi-Martin scores again\n\nUnited striker Chido Obi-Martin celebrated signing his first professional contract by scoring the opener in the Under-18s' 3-0 win over Stoke City on Saturday.\n\nThe Danish youth international put United ahead with 71 minutes on the clock, converting a penalty, before James Scanlon and Dante Plunkett made sure of the points in the closing stages.\n\nTurning 17 on Friday, Obi-Martin's maiden professional contract was allowed to commence at Old Trafford. The striker signed a scholarship with an agreement for his professional contract to begin when he turned 17 after joining United from Arsenal in the summer.\n\n### Casemiro on Amorim\n\nCasemiro has said all of United's players are 'excited' by the recent appointment of Amorim at Old Trafford.\n\nThe 39-year-old, who was appointed from Sporting Lisbon earlier this month, oversaw his first victory as United head coach on Thursday night, leading his side to a 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nAfter seeing Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute opener wiped out, United recovered from 2-1 down to clinch their second Europa League win of the campaign.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    [\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Casemiro\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"all of United's players are 'excited' by the recent appointment of Amorim at Old Trafford.\",\n    \"summary\": \"We're all excited about Amorim's appointment.\",\n    \"id\": \"a0268a4d-4528-4703-8dfa-8e1c94217e9e\"\n  }\n]\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - Text written by the author of the article is not included – UNLESS – it is contained within brackets or parentheses and provides context that helps a reader understand the quote.

It was the United boss who signed him from Coventry back in the summer of 2023, and he has already scored over 60 goals for Sporting across all competitions in just a season and a half.\n\nGyokeres' inspired form in front of goal has made him a transfer target for a number of top European clubs, including United and [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc). Some reports suggest [he has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-heart-set-one-30473775), although he is seemingly in no rush to leave his current club.\n\nIn a recent interview with Swedish outlet Fotbollskanalen, Gyokeres said: \"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to. It's just rumours, nothing concrete.\n\n\"Of course, I want to finish the season at Sporting. I'm enjoying my time there. I don't feel stressed about making a change in the future. We'll see when the time comes.\"\n\nThat will come as disappointing news for United fans, with the club lacking a clinical striker, despite the arrival of [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) from Bologna over the summer. However, it's worth noting Amorim, too, initially wanted to remain at Sporting until the end of the season.\n\nIn one of his final press conferences as manager of Sporting, Amorim told the media: \"I had three days to decide one option that radically changes my life.\n\n\"The only request I made was for it \\[transfer\\] to be at the end of the season, and they \\[United\\] told me that it wasn't possible; that it was now or never. I knew if I rejected it that in six months I wouldn't have it. And I knew that in six months I would know that I wouldn't be at Sporting.\"\n\nUnited's insistence they would not wait ultimately forced through the move and ensured they landed their primary managerial target. As United desperately need to close the gap on the top four, supporters will hope they can pull off a similar trick to beat their rivals to Gyokeres' signature in the upcoming transfer windows.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    [\n  {\n    \"speaker_name\": \"Viktor Gyokeres\",\n    \"raw_quote_text\": \"[On transfer rumors] \\\"It's not something I think about, nor something I give any importance to.

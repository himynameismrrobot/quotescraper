The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

They also drew with Al Hilal and Al Kholood and were knocked out of the King Cup of Champions by Al Taawoun.\\n\\nHowever, they have now qualified for the Champions League knockout stages with three games to spare. They sit second in the West Region table - all three Saudi sides occupy the top three places.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

Former [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [Stoke City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc) striker Joselu, who spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, scored a consolation for the hosts after the brace and a goal from the one-time [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) winger Angelo Gabriel.\\n\\nRonaldo shared a photo of himself and the latter doing his _Siu_ celebration during the match on the social media platform Musk owns, X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/twitter), afterwards. Eight minutes after posting, \\\"Big win tonight!\\\" Musk replied.\\n\\n\\\"Congrats!\\\" the businessman wrote, to which Ronaldo eventually responded approaching 20 hours later: \\\"@elonmusk … Glad your eyes have time for good “soccer”\\\"\\n\\n> [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) … Glad your eyes have time for good “soccer”\\n> \\n> — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) [November 26, 2024](https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1861444000638472559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nHe punctuated that response with a grinning face emoji and a flexed biceps emoji. The original post has over 68 million views, and Ronaldo has almost 114 million followers on the website, some 100 million less than Musk's 206 million.\\n\\nThe win comes three days after Al Nassr lost for the first time in the Saudi Pro League this season at home to Al Qadisiyah. Despite taking the lead through Ronaldo, the Mexico international Julian Quinones equalised before former [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc) captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored what proved to be the winning goal.\\n\\nAl Nassr has won just one of its last five domestic matches. They also drew with Al Hilal and Al Kholood and were knocked out of the King Cup of Champions by Al Taawoun.\\n\\nHowever, they have now qualified for the Champions League knockout stages with three games to spare. They sit second in the West Region table - all three Saudi sides occupy the top three places.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Objects thrown as Man City and Feyenoord fans clash during Champions League

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Objects thrown as Man City and Feyenoord fans clash during Champions League

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Objects thrown as Man City and Feyenoord fans clash during Champions League

I also said, we aren't The Sun or talkSPORT, have you looked at what they are saying today?\\n\\n\\\"All we said was, 'Is Rashford's future in doubt?' Is that malicious? He was playing awful at the time. Why go after The United Stand? Why not go after another YouTube channel or a website.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"Is was either really naive and silly, which is concerning, or calculated to cause us trouble.

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\\n\\n\\\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\\n\\n\\\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 1: Image credit: Sky Sports/X](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0542222d6dee7723/67458635803d5c87b49cea3c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_08.11.18.png)\\n\\nImage credit: Sky Sports/X\\n\\nHe added: \\\"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\\n\\n\\\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim added: \\\"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us.

I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"The guy had an issue, when \\\\[Keane\\\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ruben

They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\\n\\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\\n\\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\\n\\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s [1-1 draw at Ipswich](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report). Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\\n\\n\\\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him.

Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Ten talking points from the weekend football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ipswich Town](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswichtown)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Southampton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton)\\n*   [Arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal)\\n*   [features](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=PremierLeague:10talkingpointsfromtheweekend%E2%80%99saction&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2024%2Fnov%2F25%2Fpremier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action&type=article&internalpagecode=football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nComments (…)\\n------------\\n\\n[Sign in](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dsignin_to_comment) or [create your Guardian account](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dregister_to_comment) to join the discussion\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-11-25T08:00:36.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":4379}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\",\"description\":\"Amad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\",\"content\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n=============== \\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)\\n\\n![Image 2: Dejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840cfe382b44d072bebc725833788993c800c480/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\nDejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions.

More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 3: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI .

We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint.

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\n\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\n\nThe appointment of Ruben Amorim led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching.\n\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion with United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\n\nVan Nistelrooy's relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\n\n**Harry Maguire**\n\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leicester in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\n\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\n\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\n\n**Toby Collyer**\n\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\n\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\n\n**Antony**\n\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\n\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\n\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\n\n**Ethan Wheatley**\n\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then one possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\n\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\n\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire.\n\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for Neville, he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo, neither of whom started on Sunday.\n\n\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit [will be a winner],\" said Neville. \"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\n\n\"We saw [Noussair] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\n\n\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of [Marcus] Rashford, [Alejandro] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\n\n\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, [Rasmus] Hojlund, [Joshua] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\n\n\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\n\n\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After he left Old Trafford on the Monday, the Reds wasted little time finding his successor with Ruben Amorim appointed the following Friday.\n\nDue to an agreement with Sporting Lisbon, Amorim did not begin work at Old Trafford until Monday, November 11 - the start of the final international break of the year. As such, his first match in charge of the club came on Sunday when United drew 1-1 at Ipswich Town despite taking the lead inside 90 seconds.\n\nOf course, it will take longer than one match to implement a new style on this United team but former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott believes the Reds need to let this season go particularly with such a relentless run of games between now and the new year. He told Sky Sports' Monday Night Football: \"That [implementing a new season] is the difficulty he is going to have at this part of the season. The November/December period before Christmas is for me always an interesting time where it is all about recovery for the players. I think at times now, the players are just going to have to get on with it and need to learn really quickly. They will do a lot of walkthrough, I would have thought, but they need to get in the habits, plant the seed which will be repetition, repetition just to adapt to the system. They will have to learn very quickly but I think as well, they need to just write off this season. It has been a long time [of pain] for Man United and they are going to have to accept that as they have got the man they want now. But, how long will they stay in this system particularly when they want to get results?\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 26-year-old also has four assists to his name.\n\nAs a result of his spectacular form, Gyokeres has been linked with a host of different clubs around the continent, including the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Barcelona.\n\nHowever, since Ruben Amorim left Sporting for Old Trafford, reports linking Gyokeres with a move to United have picked up.\n\nIt has now been claimed that the striker has made up his mind on which club he wants to join in the future.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, Gyokeres has his eyes set on a move to Old Trafford, in what would be a reunion with former boss Amorim.\n\nThe report stated: \"SunSport understands Sporting Lisbon striker Gyokeres has his heart set on a move to the Premier League and a reunion with ex-boss Ruben Amorim at Manchester United.\"\n\nBefore joining United, Amorim was asked about potentially reuniting with Gyokeres at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Portuguese said: \"No, no, no. I cannot be funny with that in this moment. It was tough for me to leave, if I start joking about that with Gyokeres, I’ll have problems. This is my city, this is my country, I will respect.\n\n\"Viktor has to stay until the end of the season and then his life is going, maybe, somewhere else.\"\n\nWhen asked about about Amorim, Gyokeres himself said: \"We will miss him a lot, of course.\n\n\"We achieved a lot together and we will miss him and the other members of the staff, but they are leaving and we have to move on and face the next challenge we have.\"\n\nGyokeres is set to start for Sporting as they resume their UEFA Champions League campaign against Arsenal at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday night.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\n\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\n\nThe appointment of Ruben Amorim led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching.\n\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion with United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\n\nVan Nistelrooy's relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\n\n**Harry Maguire**\n\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leicester in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\n\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\n\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\n\n**Toby Collyer**\n\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\n\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\n\n**Antony**\n\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\n\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\n\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\n\n**Ethan Wheatley**\n\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then one possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\n\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\n\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

After he left Old Trafford on the Monday, the Reds wasted little time finding his successor with Ruben Amorim appointed the following Friday.\n\nDue to an agreement with Sporting Lisbon, Amorim did not begin work at Old Trafford until Monday, November 11 - the start of the final international break of the year. As such, his first match in charge of the club came on Sunday when United drew 1-1 at Ipswich Town despite taking the lead inside 90 seconds.\n\nOf course, it will take longer than one match to implement a new style on this United team but former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott believes the Reds need to let this season go particularly with such a relentless run of games between now and the new year. He told Sky Sports' Monday Night Football: \"That [implementing a new season] is the difficulty he is going to have at this part of the season. The November/December period before Christmas is for me always an interesting time where it is all about recovery for the players. I think at times now, the players are just going to have to get on with it and need to learn really quickly. They will do a lot of walkthrough, I would have thought, but they need to get in the habits, plant the seed which will be repetition, repetition just to adapt to the system. They will have to learn very quickly but I think as well, they need to just write off this season. It has been a long time [of pain] for Man United and they are going to have to accept that as they have got the man they want now. But, how long will they stay in this system particularly when they want to get results?\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Erik ten Hag's Manchester United legacy to Ruben Amorim speaks volumes - Manchester Evening News\n\nManchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town where the new 3-4-3 system was debuted.\nBy Jack Flintham, Sport Central Audience Writer\n\nManchester United have been told to write this season off after a historically poor start to the Premier League under Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe Dutchman was fired by Ineos on October 28 following a 2-1 defeat at West Ham United. After he left Old Trafford on the Monday, the Reds wasted little time finding his successor with Ruben Amorim appointed the following Friday.\n\nDue to an agreement with Sporting Lisbon, Amorim did not begin work at Old Trafford until Monday, November 11 - the start of the final international break of the year. As such, his first match in charge of the club came on Sunday when United drew 1-1 at Ipswich Town despite taking the lead inside 90 seconds.\n\nOf course, it will take longer than one match to implement a new style on this United team but former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott believes the Reds need to let this season go particularly with such a relentless run of games between now and the new year. He told Sky Sports' Monday Night Football: \"That [implementing a new season] is the difficulty he is going to have at this part of the season. The November/December period before Christmas is for me always an interesting time where it is all about recovery for the players. I think at times now, the players are just going to have to get on with it and need to learn really quickly. They will do a lot of walkthrough, I would have thought, but they need to get in the habits, plant the seed which will be repetition, repetition just to adapt to the system. They will have to learn very quickly but I think as well, they need to just write off this season. It has been a long time [of pain] for Man United and they are going to have to accept that as they have got the man they want now. But, how long will they stay in this system particularly when they want to get results?\"",

But you caused a big stir, and he caused a bigger stir, when he reacted to your YouTube channel. And that's Marcus Rashford.\n\n\"He posted a comment on one of your tweets. He said: 'Please stop spreading malicious rumours.'\n\n\"Now for a player to come out, and accuse you of spreading lies... what was your reaction?\"\n\n**Goldbridge**: \"It's disappointing. Ultimately, I would love to see Marcus Rashford play good football for Manchester United and score goals. That's all that matters. I don't really care what he's like as a person. That's the bottom line.\n\n\"But in relation to that situation, we tried to reach out to his agent but got nothing back, to sort of say, 'C'mon. This is a guy who is doing book deals and charity work, and you are replying to something that's out of context. Look at the s**storm it has caused.\n\n\"I'd say 75 per cent of people are saying, 'Oh, go on Rashford, well done' but 25 per cent are going, 'What are you doing?'. I also said, we aren't The Sun or talkSPORT, have you looked at what they are saying today?\n\n\"All we said was, 'Is Rashford's future in doubt?' Is that malicious? He was playing awful at the time. Why go after The United Stand? Why not go after another YouTube channel or a website.\n\n\"Is was either really naive and silly, which is concerning, or calculated to cause us trouble. This is one of the biggest earners and reputation players at Manchester United and you're getting involved in a Twitter thing like that.\"\n\nHe added: \"And if he is bothered, that's even more worrying about how the mentality of the modern player is. Ultimately, that was nothing about getting booted out, it was about him not playing well and if Garnacho was going to take his place.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

[Jamie Redknapp](https://www.sportbible.com/jamie-redknapp), meanwhile, was heard telling the group to \"just leave it\".\n\nNow, season ticket holder Neil Finbow, 55, has given a further insight into the row after standing right next to the former Manchester United captain as the incident played out.\n\n\"It was the guy in the middle's comments that got him, I think,\" Finbow told [**The Mirror**](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ipswich-fan-roy-keane-manutd-34181330). \"He was going on about his time when he was manager, how he treated his kids.\"\n\nFinbow continued: \"I will sort of defend [Roy Keane](https://www.sportbible.com/roy-keane) here as well, because it may be that the comment 'I'll see you in the car park' is to talk to the guy rather than take him out, so it can be misconstrued. I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\n\n\"The guy had an issue, when \\[Keane\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that. So obviously that's been pent-up.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't have any regrets \\[about going down the front\\]. It's pent-up anger. No swear words came out of my mouth, I just said 'you're a better pundit than you are a manager'.\"\n\nSky Sports will reportedly investigate the incident to see if any action is needed, while Finbow admits he is concerned about the future of his season ticket.\n\n\"Everyone I sit with knows what I'm like,\" he said. \"I'm in the family bit there, I've been there for years. I do worry about my season ticket, someone has put on there that it could affect it, but I don't think I've been abusive or anything. If people class that as abuse then it's just gone mad.\"\n\nFinbow added: \"I want my side to be heard, that it was more sarcasm than anything. To be fair, he's provoked it by coming over, hasn't he? I was actually saying 'calm down, Roy', funnily enough, which I've been telling a lot of my friends to do this morning.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\n\n\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\n\n\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\"\n\nHe added: \"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\"\n\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\n\n\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\" he said.\n\n\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\"\n\nAmorim added: \"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\n\nThoughts on Amorim's first game in charge as United manager? Let us know in the comments.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

No contract will outweigh the cost of replacement and the drop in output. Get it done!”\n\nWith a third saying: “If Mo, Virgil and Trent leave, it’ll be extremely embarrassing and disastrous to FSG. Everything at Liverpool is going through these players. Can’t afford to lose even one of them.”\n\nWhile a fourth exclaimed: “I think Virg knows something might be coming up. No way our captain isn't in on it.”\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah.

I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane.

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Sky Sports / Getty\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\n\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\n\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\n\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\n\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what Manchester United need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\n\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Ipswich. Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\n===========================================================\n\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\n\n1\n\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\n---------------------------------\n\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI.\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box... His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet.\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.”\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool... if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help...\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri... Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential.\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players... at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt.\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham...\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month... “He can play in four positions, he understands the game... and he also can score goals.”\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks...  now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton,\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal... the problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning.\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | -1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | -7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | -8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | -8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | -10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | -7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | -15 | 4 |\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him.

What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI.\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box... His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet.\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.”\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool... if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help...\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri...

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.",

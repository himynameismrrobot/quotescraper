Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 53: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\\n\\n[Sanchez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez) joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league). In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United predicted line-up vs Everton as new midfield unleashed and Amad recalled](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-predicted-line-up-30485990)**\\n\\n\\\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\\\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \\\"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\\n\\n\\\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\\\"\\n\\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\\n\\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\\n\\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Alexis Sanchez sits at a table and signs his Manchester United contract.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047886.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-908841626.jpg)\\n\\nAlexis Sanchez joined Manchester United in January 2018. (Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \\\"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\\n\\n\\\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\\\"\\n\\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\\n\\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\\n\\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Jose Mourinho points out instructions to Alexis Sanchez while the latter drinks from a bottle at the edge of the Old Trafford pitch.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047899.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1044628628.jpg)\\n\\nJose Mourinho (right) once left Alexis Sanchez out of a matchday squad completely. (Image: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images.)\\n\\n\\\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\\\" he said. \\\"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\\n\\n\\\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\\\"\\n\\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\\n\\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\\n\\n[Sanchez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez) joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league). In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United predicted line-up vs Everton as new midfield unleashed and Amad recalled](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-predicted-line-up-30485990)**\\n\\n\\\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\\\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \\\"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\\n\\n\\\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\\\"\\n\\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\\n\\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\\n\\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Alexis Sanchez sits at a table and signs his Manchester United contract.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047886.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-908841626.jpg)\\n\\nAlexis Sanchez joined Manchester United in January 2018. (Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \\\"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\\n\\n\\\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\\\"\\n\\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\\n\\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\\n\\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Jose Mourinho points out instructions to Alexis Sanchez while the latter drinks from a bottle at the edge of the Old Trafford pitch.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047899.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1044628628.jpg)\\n\\nJose Mourinho (right) once left Alexis Sanchez out of a matchday squad completely. (Image: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images.)\\n\\n\\\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\\\" he said. \\\"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\\n\\n\\\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\\\"\\n\\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\\n\\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\\n\\n[Sanchez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez) joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league). In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United predicted line-up vs Everton as new midfield unleashed and Amad recalled](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-predicted-line-up-30485990)**\\n\\n\\\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\\\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \\\"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\\n\\n\\\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\\\"\\n\\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\\n\\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\\n\\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Alexis Sanchez sits at a table and signs his Manchester United contract.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047886.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-908841626.jpg)\\n\\nAlexis Sanchez joined Manchester United in January 2018. (Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \\\"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\\n\\n\\\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\\\"\\n\\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\\n\\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\\n\\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Jose Mourinho points out instructions to Alexis Sanchez while the latter drinks from a bottle at the edge of the Old Trafford pitch.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047899.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1044628628.jpg)\\n\\nJose Mourinho (right) once left Alexis Sanchez out of a matchday squad completely. (Image: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images.)\\n\\n\\\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\\\" he said. \\\"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\\n\\n\\\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\\\"\\n\\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\\n\\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\\n\\n[Sanchez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alexis-sanchez) joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league). In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United predicted line-up vs Everton as new midfield unleashed and Amad recalled](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-predicted-line-up-30485990)**\\n\\n\\\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\\\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \\\"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\\n\\n\\\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\\\"\\n\\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\\n\\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\\n\\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\\n\\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Alexis Sanchez sits at a table and signs his Manchester United contract.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047886.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-908841626.jpg)\\n\\nAlexis Sanchez joined Manchester United in January 2018. (Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \\\"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\\n\\n\\\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\\\"\\n\\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\\n\\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\\n\\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Jose Mourinho points out instructions to Alexis Sanchez while the latter drinks from a bottle at the edge of the Old Trafford pitch.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29047899.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1044628628.jpg)\\n\\nJose Mourinho (right) once left Alexis Sanchez out of a matchday squad completely. (Image: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images.)\\n\\n\\\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\\\" he said. \\\"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\\n\\n\\\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\\\"\\n\\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\\n\\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\\n\\nNevertheless, [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana) is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\\n\\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) will be recalled.\\n\\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\\n\\nIt is possible Kobbie Mainoo could be unleashed from the start after being an unused substitute in each of the last two games. He has not played since the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6.\\n\\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut. Fernandes is likely to operate in one of the No.10 roles, likewise Marcus Rashford, who stepped off the bench in the second half on Thursday.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: A Manchester United starting XI displayed on a football pitch graphic with Old Trafford as the backdrop.

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\\n\\nNevertheless, [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana) is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\\n\\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) will be recalled.\\n\\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\\n\\nIt is possible Kobbie Mainoo could be unleashed from the start after being an unused substitute in each of the last two games. He has not played since the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6.\\n\\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut. Fernandes is likely to operate in one of the No.10 roles, likewise Marcus Rashford, who stepped off the bench in the second half on Thursday.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: A Manchester United starting XI displayed on a football pitch graphic with Old Trafford as the backdrop.

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\\n\\nNevertheless, [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana) is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\\n\\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) will be recalled.\\n\\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\\n\\nIt is possible Kobbie Mainoo could be unleashed from the start after being an unused substitute in each of the last two games. He has not played since the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6.\\n\\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut.

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\\n\\nNevertheless, [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana) is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\\n\\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) will be recalled.\\n\\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\\n\\nIt is possible Kobbie Mainoo could be unleashed from the start after being an unused substitute in each of the last two games. He has not played since the goalless draw with Aston Villa on October 6.\\n\\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut. Fernandes is likely to operate in one of the No.10 roles, likewise Marcus Rashford, who stepped off the bench in the second half on Thursday.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: A Manchester United starting XI displayed on a football pitch graphic with Old Trafford as the backdrop.

It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\\n\\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\\n\\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\\n\\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\\n\\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\\n\\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\\n\\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\\n\\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\\n\\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\\n\\n**Amad to cement his place?**\\n\\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\\n\\nRasmus Hojlund was \\\"dead\\\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\\n\\n**Who will have the ball?**\\n\\n\\\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\\\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\\n\\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\\n\\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\\n\\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\\n\\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\\n\\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\\n\\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\\n\\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\\n\\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\\n\\n**Amad to cement his place?**\\n\\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\\n\\nRasmus Hojlund was \\\"dead\\\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\\n\\n**Who will have the ball?**\\n\\n\\\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\\\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\\n\\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\\n\\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\\n\\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\\n\\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\\n\\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\\n\\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\\n\\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\\n\\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\\n\\n**Amad to cement his place?**\\n\\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\\n\\nRasmus Hojlund was \\\"dead\\\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\\n\\n**Who will have the ball?**\\n\\n\\\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\\\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\\n\\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\\n\\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\\n\\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\\n\\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\\n\\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\\n\\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\\n\\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\\n\\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\\n\\n**Amad to cement his place?**\\n\\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\\n\\n**87 min:** As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him.\\n\\nCole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that.\\n\\nCole Palmer that is a DISGRACE! What a goal!\\n\\n![Image 5: Cole Palmer scores for Chelsea](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17db976eb106442f2c83a48ebd0f0b0b556da6d/0_0_2955_1816/master/2955.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#img-4)\\n\\nCold. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\n**82 min:** Caicedo shows his worth by intercepting a Villa pass and then embarking on a direct run from box to box. Old school.\\n\\nHe feeds Palmer, who naturally doesn’t waste the ball, but wins a free-kick near the edge of the area.\\n\\n**But back to Ange-ball.** Two draws from winning positions in the week following the thrashing of City isn’t all that great. If indeed it finishes 1-1.\\n\\n“**I think everyone** talks about new manager bounce,” Everton’s Dyche said on Friday before facing [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) and their shiny new manager. “It’s more difficult in that way … they’ve got good players, I’m sure he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] has been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across.\\n\\n“I don’t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts.”\\n\\n**An email!** Entitled: “Reaction.”\\n\\n“Disbelief mixed with fear of the inevitable stoppage time Spurs winner,” writes Richard Hirst of Tottenham 1-1 [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) (latest score).\\n\\n“I’ve been a Fulham fan for 60 years - I have previous.”\\n\\n**74 min:** Emery sits on his airline-style seat with his hands plunged into his pockets and a puzzled look on his fact. How does he get his team out of this current malaise? How has their form fallen off a cliff like this? My expert opinion is that they look tired. Give them a couple of days off.\\n\\n**72 min:** Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it’ll make for a spicy denouement. They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min. Now Philogene and Rogers are off for Leon Bailey and Jhon Duran.\\n\\nAll square in north London.

I believe he may have been injured after that howler which nearly handed a goal to Jackson. Robin Olsen is in nets for Villa.\\n\\nWowzers, United are BACK, baby!

According to the commentators, Fofana stood on the ball and injured himself in the process, although in the style of a certain former Arsenal gaffer, I didn’t see it.\\n\\n“**Yeah Luke**, but [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) 12 shots to Spurs’ six, and 10 corners to Spurs’ four,” fumes Richard Hirst. “Less about Ange-ball than Fulham’s customary inability to acquaint ball with net.”\\n\\n**54 min:** Sancho, who perhaps needless to say looks like an utterly different player to the [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) version, cuts in from the Chelsea left and sprints towards the box. Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez.\\n\\nGo Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong!

After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Clockwatch](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/saturday-clockwatch)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea)\\n*   [Aston Villa](https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=ManchesterUnited4-0Everton,Chelsea3-0AstonVillaandmore:PremierLeague%E2%80%93asithappened&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Flive%2F2024%2Fdec%2F01%2Fmanchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live&type=article&internalpagecode=football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-12-01T16:19:51.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":10030}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Manchester United 4-0 Everton, Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa and more: Premier League – as it happened\",\"description\":\"Cole Palmer starred for Chelsea as Villa were overwhelmed, Manchester United thumped Everton and Tottenham drew with Fulham\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live\",\"content\":\"Manchester United 4-0 Everton, Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa and more: Premier League – as it happened | Premier League | The Guardian\\n===============\\n                                                                            \\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#navigation)[Skip to key events](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#key-events-carousel)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#navigation)\\n\\n[Clockwatch](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/saturday-clockwatch)[Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n\\n[Clockwatch](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/saturday-clockwatch)[Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n\\nManchester United 4-0 Everton, Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa and more: Premier League – as it happened\\n================================================================================================\\n\\nCole Palmer starred for Chelsea as Aston Villa were overwhelmed, Manchester United thumped Everton and Tottenham drew with Fulham\\n\\n Updated 5h ago\\n\\n[Luke McLaughlin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/luke-mclaughlin)\\n\\nSun 1 Dec 2024 11.19 ESTFirst published on Sun 1 Dec 2024 08.03 EST\\n\\nShare\\n\\nKey events\\n\\n*   [7h ago Full-time: Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-674c80938f0816561c49ff4a#block-674c80938f0816561c49ff4a)\\n*   [7h ago Full-time: Tottenham 1-1 Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-674c804d8f0816561c49ff48#block-674c804d8f0816561c49ff48)\\n*   [7h ago Full-time: Manchester United 4-0 Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-674c7f628f088c7046fe0d7d#block-674c7f628f088c7046fe0d7d)\\n*   [7h ago Goal!

Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left.

They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min.

Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez.\\n\\nGo Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong!

After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*

Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\\n\\n**87 min:** As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him.\\n\\nCole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that.\\n\\nCole Palmer that is a DISGRACE! What a goal!\\n\\n![Image 5: Cole Palmer scores for Chelsea](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17db976eb106442f2c83a48ebd0f0b0b556da6d/0_0_2955_1816/master/2955.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#img-4)\\n\\nCold.

Old school.\\n\\nHe feeds Palmer, who naturally doesn’t waste the ball, but wins a free-kick near the edge of the area.\\n\\n**But back to Ange-ball.** Two draws from winning positions in the week following the thrashing of City isn’t all that great. If indeed it finishes 1-1.\\n\\n“**I think everyone** talks about new manager bounce,” Everton’s Dyche said on Friday before facing [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) and their shiny new manager. “It’s more difficult in that way … they’ve got good players, I’m sure he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] has been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across.\\n\\n“I don’t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts.”\\n\\n**An email!** Entitled: “Reaction.”\\n\\n“Disbelief mixed with fear of the inevitable stoppage time Spurs winner,” writes Richard Hirst of Tottenham 1-1 [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) (latest score).\\n\\n“I’ve been a Fulham fan for 60 years - I have previous.”\\n\\n**74 min:** Emery sits on his airline-style seat with his hands plunged into his pockets and a puzzled look on his fact. How does he get his team out of this current malaise? How has their form fallen off a cliff like this? My expert opinion is that they look tired. Give them a couple of days off.\\n\\n**72 min:** Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it’ll make for a spicy denouement. They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min. Now Philogene and Rogers are off for Leon Bailey and Jhon Duran.\\n\\nAll square in north London.

According to the commentators, Fofana stood on the ball and injured himself in the process, although in the style of a certain former Arsenal gaffer, I didn’t see it.\\n\\n“**Yeah Luke**, but [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) 12 shots to Spurs’ six, and 10 corners to Spurs’ four,” fumes Richard Hirst. “Less about Ange-ball than Fulham’s customary inability to acquaint ball with net.”\\n\\n**54 min:** Sancho, who perhaps needless to say looks like an utterly different player to the [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) version, cuts in from the Chelsea left and sprints towards the box. Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez.\\n\\nGo Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong!

After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*

Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left.

They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min.

Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention.

Watkins cracks a low shot, saved by Sanchez. Careless from [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea), and that might affect Maresca’s half-time team talk a bit because they were in full control until then.\\n\\n**45 min:** We’ll have a minimum of five minutes added on at Stamford Bridge.\\n\\n**Tottenham v Fulham** remains NIL-NIL.\\n\\nUnited win the third, fourth and fifth ball (not that I’ve seen the goal mind you) and they are 2-0 up on [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton) at Old Trafford.\\n\\n![Image 9: Joshua Zirkzee](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec89ab0719c174009e53b96b62a2b8da47d697d2/0_0_3504_2336/master/3504.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#img-8)\\n\\nJoshua Zirkzee doubles the lead for Amorim’s Army. Photograph: Dave Thompson/AP\\n\\n**41 min:** Now Palmer takes a ball to feet from Caicedo and turns and shoots from the edge of the area – but he scuffs it badly. Still, lots of space to operate for Chelsea’s attackers. Villa look punch-drunk.\\n\\n**It’s a classy move by Chelsea** and classy assist by (who else, by the way?) Cole Palmer.\\n\\nHe arrows a pass to the feet of Fernandez who places a smart finish beyond Martinez from just inside the area. It’s a perfect first touch that tees up the shot perfectly, but doesn’t give the covering defenders a chance to get near him.\\n\\nVilla look way off the pace defensively and their slump is threatening to become a crisis.\\n\\nVilla were wobbling.

Nothing less than they deserve against an off-form Aston Villa Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\n**35 min:** [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) are pushing. Villa are wobbling. Sancho buys a yard of space in the box and fires a shot goalwards but it’s high and wide. He has a word with the ref after, as if he wants a penalty, but his claim is waved away. Perhaps he got a little shove in the back but nothing major.\\n\\n**Manchester United**, presumably having won a second ball, take the lead via Marcus Rashford.\\n\\n**Tottenham** … 0  \\n[Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) … 0\\n\\n(latest score)\\n\\n**30 min:** Deary me! After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*

That victory over the Norwegian side marked the first win of the Amorim era after United could only draw 1-1 with Ipswich in the Portuguese's first game in charge last weekend.\n\nEverton visit Old Trafford having won just twice in the league this season and Sean Dyche's side haven't scored in their last three games. Ahead of the first home league game of the Amorim era, here's a look at the latest United headlines.\n\n**READ MORE:** **[United supporters group announce ticket price protest ahead of Everton fixture](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-supporters-group-announce-30461312)**\n\n**READ MORE:** **[Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are betraying United fans over ticket price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/sir-jim-ratcliffe-ineos-betraying-30480953)**\n\n### Obi-Martin scores again\n\nUnited striker Chido Obi-Martin celebrated signing his first professional contract by scoring the opener in the Under-18s' 3-0 win over Stoke City on Saturday.\n\nThe Danish youth international put United ahead with 71 minutes on the clock, converting a penalty, before James Scanlon and Dante Plunkett made sure of the points in the closing stages.\n\nTurning 17 on Friday, Obi-Martin's maiden professional contract was allowed to commence at Old Trafford.

Six changes against Bodo/Glimt was more than expected and he could stray close to that number against Everton.\n\nRasmus Hojlund was \"dead\" after a 90-minute shift and some of the substitutions were made with today's game in mind. Diogo Dalot, Amad and Marcus Rashford will all be relatively fresh after their second-half appearances. Christian Eriksen did not play at all and United are certain to have the majority of possession this afternoon.\n\n**Who will have the ball?**\n\n\"We need to have the ball because we have a short time to recover,\" Amorim stressed. It is curious that Kobbie Mainoo has been completely unused in the Portuguese's first two games in charge when United would benefit from a conductor in midfield against shot-shy Everton.\n\nMainoo's full Premier League debut was a memorable one in a 3-0 victory at Goodison Park 12 months ago but he is unlikely to be parachuted back into the starting XI eight weeks on from his last outing at Villa Park. Eriksen is an option or Bruno Fernandes could continue in a deeper role. Fernandes was especially excellent there against Everton at Old Trafford last season and the season before.\n\n**Mason Mounting a comeback?**\n\nAfter a first start in 96 days in midweek today could be Mason Mount's first Premier League start in 99 days. His last one - at Brighton - was his most impressive for United yet it was cut short by injury.\n\nMount lasted just shy of an hour against Bodo and his removal was possibly as much to preserve him for today as it was to manage his return. Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount in successive weeks and he looked comfortable as one of the two 10s behind Hojlund.\n\n**Eyes on Branthwaite**\n\nUnited had two offers of £43million and £50m rejected for Jarrad Branthwaite in the summer before they made Leny Yoro their marquee 'potential' signing. Branthwaite, like Yoro, has had his fair share of injury problems and has only made three starts this term.\n\nHis return has coincided with Everton keeping two successive clean sheets. They did not score at the other end, mind, and played more than a half against ten-man Brentford last week.\n\nBranthwaite, 22, will inevitably leave Everton for big money but maybe not as big as the £70m they held out for in the summer. United will need to sign probably two centre backs next year and Branthwaite still fits the bill.\n\n**Amad to cement his place?**\n\nAmad will be in the majority of United fans' starting XIs today and his selection would confirm his first-team status under the new head coach. Today should be Amad's fourth start in five games and he was very clearly rested on Thursday night.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    []\n    \n    # Quote validation rules\n    - Valid quotes can contain text which provides context about the quote as long as it is contained within brackets or parentheses.\n    - Valid quotes never include descriptive / narrative text written by the author of the article.\n    - Valid quotes have a summary that sounds like a quote itself and should therefore be written as if they actually spoke it.

United are at the start of a fixture marathon, meaning rotation is set to be a familiar theme over the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, Andre Onana is poised to maintain his record of starting every Premier League fixture since joining United from Inter Milan in the 2023 summer transfer window. He has kept five clean sheets in the league so far this season and will be determined to add to his collection.\n\nAmorim recalled Lisandro Martinez to the starting XI on Thursday night and he stored 60 minutes under his belt after missing the trip to Ipswich with a back problem. He started in the back-three alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and it is possible they could be deployed as a trio once again.\n\nAs far as the wing-back roles are concerned, Amorim made changes on both flanks in midweek, handing starts to Tyrell Malacia and Antony. Neither player did enough to justify retaining their places for the clash with Sean Dyche's side, meaning it is highly likely both Diogo Dalot and Amad will be recalled.\n\nAmorim is not light on options in the centre of midfield, but Manuel Ugarte could retain his place after a polished performance last time out. Bruno Fernandes operated in a deeper role alongside the Uruguayan, but he could be pushed into a more advanced role.\n\nIn attack, Hojlund could keep his place after scoring two goals and claiming an assist on Amorim's home debut. Fernandes is likely to operate in one of the No.10 roles, likewise Marcus Rashford, who stepped off the bench in the second half on Thursday.\n\n**United predicted XI vs Everton:** Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Mainoo, Dalot; Fernandes, Hojlund, Rashford.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    []\n    \n    # Quote validation rules\n    - Valid quotes can contain text which provides context about the quote as long as it is contained within brackets or parentheses.\n    - Valid quotes never include descriptive / narrative text written by the author of the article.\n    - Valid quotes have a summary that sounds like a quote itself and should therefore be written as if they actually spoke it.

Considering United had secured themselves the services of a winger who had been free-scoring for the best part of 18 months, there was little doubt about who had got the better end of the deal.\n\nSanchez joined the club for a £14million fee and had already scored nine goals in the first half of the 2017/18 campaign, seven of which had been scored in the Premier League. In truth, it was a relatively small fee to pay for such a reliable source of goals.\n\n\"I am thrilled to be joining the biggest club in the world,\" Sanchez told United's club website after completing his move to Old Trafford. \"I have spent three-and-a-half wonderful years at Arsenal and I bring with me very positive memories of that great club and its fans.\n\n\"The chance to play in this historic stadium and to work with Jose Mourinho was something I could not turn down. I am very proud to be the first Chilean player ever to play for United and I hope I can show our fans all around the world why the club wanted to bring me here.\"\n\nTwo-and-a-half-years, one loan spell and 45 appearances later, Sanchez's United career reached the end of the road when he was allowed to join Inter Milan, who the aforementioned loan spell was with, on a free transfer in August 2020. His relatively short stint at Old Trafford was massively underwhelming and nobody looks back on his time at the club with much fondness. His biggest highlight was scoring United's equaliser in the 2018 FA Cup semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nIn total, he scored a paltry five goals for the club, three of which were netted before his first and only full season in United colours. He made just 27 appearances in that campaign (2018/19) and struggled to nail down a starting berth under both Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nSanchez had been the subject of interest from Manchester City prior to his move to United, only for the Blues to back out of a deal to sign him because of his wage demands. That left United with a clear run to secure his signature.\n\nBut despite the words chosen by Sanchez at the time of his unveiling, he was not, as it turned out, overly thrilled at making the switch to Old Trafford, so much so that he wanted to quit after his very first training session at Carrington. The Chilean, who is now 35, revealed a month after leaving the Reds how he begged his agent to try and fashion a return to Arsenal for him.\n\nSpeaking back in September 2020, the attacker said: \"I accepted the opportunity to go to United, it felt tempting and it was something good for me, I liked this club a lot when I was a kid. Eventually I signed but I didn't ask for information on what was happening inside the club.\n\n\"Sometimes there are things that you don't realise until you get there, and I remember the first training session I had, I realised a lot of things. After the session I got home and I told my family and my agent, 'Can you not rip up the contract to go back to Arsenal?'.\n\n\"They laughed, I told them there's something that doesn't sit right, it doesn't seem good. But I already signed, I was already there. After the first few months I carried on having the same feeling, we weren't united as a team in that moment.\"\n\nAt the juncture of Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford, United were on a four-game winning run and unbeaten in seven, meaning he should have walked into a happy, upbeat and vibrant camp. Instead, judging by his comments, he walked into a fractured and broken dressing room that wasn't united.\n\nFollowing his mid-season arrival in 2017/18, Sanchez made 18 appearances before the end of the campaign, helping United finish second in the Premier League table and reach the FA Cup final, only to be beaten by Chelsea at Wembley, losing out to Eden Hazard's first-half penalty.\n\nA little over a month into the 2018/19 campaign, Sanchez was left out of United's matchday squad for the visit of West Ham United. It was a bombshell decision by Mourinho and it had a major impact on the winger.\n\n\"In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked,\" he said. \"That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible.\n\n\"To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift because I love what I do.\"\n\nSanchez's switch from Arsenal to United will go down as one of the biggest failed transfers in Premier League history. Arsenal got a slightly better tally of nine goals and 13 assists out of Mkhitaryan, meaning they got the better end of the deal.\n\nThe Armenian and Sanchez now play together in Milan with Inter. United supporters won't have too many fond memories of either of them.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    []\n    \n    # Quote validation rules\n    - Valid quotes can contain text which provides context about the quote as long as it is contained within brackets or parentheses.\n    - Valid quotes never include descriptive / narrative text written by the author of the article.\n    - Valid quotes have a summary that sounds like a quote itself and should therefore be written as if they actually spoke it.

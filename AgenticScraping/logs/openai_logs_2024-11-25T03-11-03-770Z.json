Smiling throughout, he made clear his belief both in himself and in his players, claiming he is \"the right guy at the right moment\".  \nHe has acknowledged that Manchester United need time and has said that they need to improve...\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Having decided to call it a day at the end of the 2021/22 season, the realisation that it was all coming to an end arrived as he flung himself about to stop Bruno Fernandes and Juan Mata from scoring.\n\"As Bruno and Juan were smashing balls at me, I was distracted, thinking to myself, 'Gosh, this is my last time out on the grass with my boots and gloves on, diving around in the mud laughing and joking with team-mates,'\" Grant told the Premier League website last year.\n“I was apprehensive about transitioning from a role I’d loved doing for more than 20 years, but also excited at the proposition of stepping into the unknown and beginning a new journey.\"\nFor a while, it looked like his second career in the game would begin where the first one ended. A year earlier, as he discussed his future with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the option of a coaching role with United's youngsters had been floated.\n“Towards the end of my days as a player I did spend a lot of time with the analysis team or in the coach's office with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Kieran, picking their brains, and pulling sessions off the hard drive that I could use in my work with the Under 15s,\" he said.\n“United let me train young players at their academy, and the analysis team always left their door open, giving me access to footage of training clips. They gave me a glimpse behind the curtain, showing me what is needed to coach at a high level, which I will always be thankful for.”\nInstead, a familiar face from Carrington provided Grant with his first coaching role. When McKenna took over as Ipswich manager in December 2021, the Tractor Boys were in League One, and he initially took United first-team coach Martyn Pert with him.\nThen, in May 2022, Grant joined as first-team coach rather than goalkeeping coach. Two successive promotions have since taken the club - and the coaching staff - to the Premier League.\n“When Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna asked if I’d be interested in joining his first-team staff, I was ecstatic and I still am,\" said Grant. \"Getting to carry on being out on the grass with the boys, alongside my fellow coaches, enjoying the camaraderie, is something I love so much.\"\nGrant worked through his coaching badges during his final decade or so in the game, having decided well before he retired that he wanted to pursue a career in coaching. Ipswich already had a goalkeeping coach, Rene Gilmartin, who remains in that role today. So Grant came in as a first-team coach and quickly took the club's forwards under his wing. A man who spent his career trying to stop goals was now helping people paid to score goals.\n“On the outside it probably looks a bit of a strange one for a 'keeper to be coaching strikers but, in reality, it certainly doesn't feel like that for me, and I hope it doesn't for the players,” said Grant.\n“I spent a long time working on how to stop the ball going into the net, which gives me insights I can pass on to the forwards to help them combat 'keepers’ mindsets. Flipping things around, thinking about it from the opposite angle does make a lot of sense.\nGrant's insights have helped Ipswich score 205 goals in their last 103 league games. Having joined a side in League One, he is now a first-team coach in the Premier League, and scoring enough goals will be key to the club's hopes of survival.\nDelap, a £20m summer signing from Manchester City, has scored half of the Tractor Boys' 12 Premier League goals. The level is going up, but Grant is still having an impact. This week he will try and help his forwards get the better of his old club.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red hear emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Captain Bruno Fernandes can.\nThe misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.\nOf the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.\nDe Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.\nAs costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games. That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.\nThere are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer. Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.\nThe difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.\nThe tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.\nTen Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.\nThere is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.\nPotter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.\nFan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.\nUnited bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.\nHalf-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.\nThat was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4. What an amazing feeling,” he wrote. “Thank you to the fans, staff and players for making me feel welcome from the start, it’s been a long season but we showed just how good we can be.”\n\nAmong the comments was United full-back Shaw, who replied with two red hear emojis. The two played together at Old Trafford from when Lingard made his debut in 2014 to when he left the club in 2022.\n\nWhile Lingard’s season is now over, Shaw’s is yet to get going. The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.\n\nThe 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.\n\nThe Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25milion. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.\n\nJack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nIt was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.\n\nFletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.\n\nIf Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

United are looking to secure their third straight win in all competitions and will be just four points off the top four if they can take all three points from their clash with Ipswich.\n\nAmorim held his first pre-match press conference at the club on Friday and also sat down with [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) to react on his move to United and discuss his plans for the future.\n\n[Neville asked Amorim](https://www.skysports.com/football/video/20876/13258394/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-interview-with-gary-neville) what he thought had gone wrong for the managers who have taken charge of the club since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure and whether there were any tips he could take from their spells in charge.\n\n\"That is a hard question to answer,\" he replied. \"They have more experience than me, what I can speak about is that they (United) contacted me to be here because they saw something, so I will do my thing.\n\n\"I will not try to find out the right thing to do, try to find out what was missing with Erik (ten Hag), with (Jose) Mourinho, with (Louis) van Gaal, I will not try that. I think it's a waste of time.\n\n\"They reached me because they saw something and I do something in a clear way. You know what you will get so hopefully I will continue to do that and that is my main focus.

Having decided to call it a day at the end of the 2021/22 season, the realisation that it was all coming to an end arrived as he flung himself about to stop Bruno Fernandes and Juan Mata from scoring.\n\"As Bruno and Juan were smashing balls at me, I was distracted, thinking to myself, 'Gosh, this is my last time out on the grass with my boots and gloves on, diving around in the mud laughing and joking with team-mates,'\" Grant told the Premier League website last year.\n“I was apprehensive about transitioning from a role I’d loved doing for more than 20 years, but also excited at the proposition of stepping into the unknown and beginning a new journey.\"\nFor a while, it looked like his second career in the game would begin where the first one ended. A year earlier, as he discussed his future with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the option of a coaching role with United's youngsters had been floated.\n“Towards the end of my days as a player I did spend a lot of time with the analysis team or in the coach's office with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Kieran, picking their brains, and pulling sessions off the hard drive that I could use in my work with the Under 15s,\" he said.\n“United let me train young players at their academy, and the analysis team always left their door open, giving me access to footage of training clips. They gave me a glimpse behind the curtain, showing me what is needed to coach at a high level, which I will always be thankful for.”\nInstead, a familiar face from Carrington provided Grant with his first coaching role. When McKenna took over as Ipswich manager in December 2021, the Tractor Boys were in League One, and he initially took United first-team coach Martyn Pert with him.\nThen, in May 2022, Grant joined as first-team coach rather than goalkeeping coach. Two successive promotions have since taken the club - and the coaching staff - to the Premier League.\n“When Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna asked if I’d be interested in joining his first-team staff, I was ecstatic and I still am,\" said Grant. \"Getting to carry on being out on the grass with the boys, alongside my fellow coaches, enjoying the camaraderie, is something I love so much.\"\nGrant worked through his coaching badges during his final decade or so in the game, having decided well before he retired that he wanted to pursue a career in coaching. Ipswich already had a goalkeeping coach, Rene Gilmartin, who remains in that role today. So Grant came in as a first-team coach and quickly took the club's forwards under his wing. A man who spent his career trying to stop goals was now helping people paid to score goals.\n“On the outside it probably looks a bit of a strange one for a 'keeper to be coaching strikers but, in reality, it certainly doesn't feel like that for me, and I hope it doesn't for the players,” said Grant.\n“I spent a long time working on how to stop the ball going into the net, which gives me insights I can pass on to the forwards to help them combat 'keepers’ mindsets. Flipping things around, thinking about it from the opposite angle does make a lot of sense.\nGrant's insights have helped Ipswich score 205 goals in their last 103 league games. Having joined a side in League One, he is now a first-team coach in the Premier League, and scoring enough goals will be key to the club's hopes of survival.\nDelap, a £20m summer signing from Manchester City, has scored half of the Tractor Boys' 12 Premier League goals. The level is going up, but Grant is still having an impact. This week he will try and help his forwards get the better of his old club.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Amad scored 14 goals in 42 games for the Championship side as Sunderland reached the play-offs.\nPellistri was due to leave on loan in the summer but ended up remaining at United after Amad sustained a knee injury in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July.\nAmad returned to training in early December and he performed creditably off the bench in the loss at Forest.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

IT’S OUTSIDE THE BOX,\" while another commented: \"It’s just inside and Robertson’s foot was on the line when the foul happened.\"\n\nA third wrote: \"We just watched Michael Oliver literally watch that player dive and dive outside the box and recommend a penalty. What a scam.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"So, apparently, if you foul someone outside the box and you’re wearing a Liverpool jersey, that’s now a penalty,\" and a fifth added: \"How exactly is that a penalty against Liverpool? The tackle was outside the box, not inside.\"\n\nSouthampton striker Adam Armstrong went on to equalise for Russell Martin's side after he converted the rebound from Caoimhin Kelleher's initial save from 12 yards.\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt.

Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\n=============== \n\nIpswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\n\n1\n\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\n--------------------------------\n\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start?

By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The 31-year-old had been out of contract since his release from Nottingham Forest last summer.\n\nIt was a slow start for the former United man. His work rate was questioned by his manager Kim Gi-Dong after just three appearances for the club, before he missed nine K League games with a knee injury.\n\nUpon his return, he was a regular starter and even started wearing the captain’s armband. Lingard missed a further three matches in July with a hamstring injury, but again quickly returned to the XI.\n\nFC Seoul’s finishing place in the table led them to a five game play-off for the Championship. The final one of those matches took place on Saturday with Lingard providing an assist in a 3-1 win.\n\nThe victory saw the team finish in fourth place in K League. Lingard ended the season with six goals and three assists.\n\nFollowing the match, he took to Instagram to send a message. \"Top 4.

Having decided to call it a day at the end of the 2021/22 season, the realisation that it was all coming to an end arrived as he flung himself about to stop Bruno Fernandes and Juan Mata from scoring.\n\"As Bruno and Juan were smashing balls at me, I was distracted, thinking to myself, 'Gosh, this is my last time out on the grass with my boots and gloves on, diving around in the mud laughing and joking with team-mates,'\" Grant told the Premier League website last year.\n“I was apprehensive about transitioning from a role I’d loved doing for more than 20 years, but also excited at the proposition of stepping into the unknown and beginning a new journey.\"\nFor a while, it looked like his second career in the game would begin where the first one ended. A year earlier, as he discussed his future with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the option of a coaching role with United's youngsters had been floated.\n“Towards the end of my days as a player I did spend a lot of time with the analysis team or in the coach's office with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Kieran, picking their brains, and pulling sessions off the hard drive that I could use in my work with the Under 15s,\" he said.\n“United let me train young players at their academy, and the analysis team always left their door open, giving me access to footage of training clips. They gave me a glimpse behind the curtain, showing me what is needed to coach at a high level, which I will always be thankful for.”\nInstead, a familiar face from Carrington provided Grant with his first coaching role. When McKenna took over as Ipswich manager in December 2021, the Tractor Boys were in League One, and he initially took United first-team coach Martyn Pert with him.\nThen, in May 2022, Grant joined as first-team coach rather than goalkeeping coach. Two successive promotions have since taken the club - and the coaching staff - to the Premier League.\n“When Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna asked if I’d be interested in joining his first-team staff, I was ecstatic and I still am,\" said Grant. \"Getting to carry on being out on the grass with the boys, alongside my fellow coaches, enjoying the camaraderie, is something I love so much.\"\nGrant worked through his coaching badges during his final decade or so in the game, having decided well before he retired that he wanted to pursue a career in coaching. Ipswich already had a goalkeeping coach, Rene Gilmartin, who remains in that role today. So Grant came in as a first-team coach and quickly took the club's forwards under his wing. A man who spent his career trying to stop goals was now helping people paid to score goals.\n“On the outside it probably looks a bit of a strange one for a 'keeper to be coaching strikers but, in reality, it certainly doesn't feel like that for me, and I hope it doesn't for the players,” said Grant.\n“I spent a long time working on how to stop the ball going into the net, which gives me insights I can pass on to the forwards to help them combat 'keepers’ mindsets.

Having joined a side in League One, he is now a first-team coach in the Premier League, and scoring enough goals will be key to the club's hopes of survival.\nDelap, a £20m summer signing from Manchester City, has scored half of the Tractor Boys' 12 Premier League goals.

The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury and is yet to make an appearance, but he has now been back in training for a few weeks meaning that new head coach Ruben Amorim could potentially call on him.\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.\n\nThe 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.\n\nThe Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25milion. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.\n\nJack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nIt was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.\n\nFletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.\n\nIf Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.\n\nOn the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt.

After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\",\"article_headline\":\"Ten talking points from the weekend football\",\"article_text\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n=============== \\n\\nIpswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\\n\\n1\\n\\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League. After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\\n\\n2\\n\\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n3\\n\\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\\n\\n4\\n\\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\\n---------------------------\\n\\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n5\\n\\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\\n\\n6\\n\\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\\n\\n7\\n\\nBees need to take home sting on the road\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\\n\\n8\\n\\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\\n\\n9\\n\\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n10\\n\\nWilson: to start or not to start?\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start?

Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.\n\nThe 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.\n\nThe Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25milion. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.\n\nJack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nIt was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.\n\nFletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure.

Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.\n\nJack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.\n\nIt is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.\n\nTyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.\n\nTyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.\n\nThe Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.\n\nJack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.\n\nJack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.\n\nThe memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.\n\nJack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.\n\nUnited are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.\n\nTyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August.

After toothless performances at Newcastle and Inter in the past week – and last month at Bournemouth – Gabriel Martinelli’s cute finish was itself a moment of relief, but Mikel Arteta was frustrated that his team didn’t find a winner. Their expected goals figure was lower than Chelsea’s (1.27 to 1.69) but that does not account for Leandro Trossard’s costly miskick at the death nor Kai Havertz’s would-be opener, which was just offside. The Gunners will almost always control games, especially now Martin Ødegaard is fit and firing again, but that age-old itch has not been scratched. They are not ruthless enough and they still lack a penalty box killer. **Dominic Booth**\n\n2\n\nSlot driving Reds to remarkable start\n-------------------------------------\n\nOnly once in the past 34 seasons have Liverpool collected more points from the opening 11 games than the 28 they have now. That was in 2019-20, when Jürgen Klopp’s team amassed 31 points at the same stage and went on to end the club’s 30-year wait for the league title. In Arne Slot Liverpool possess a head coach not only with the methodology to win 15 of his first 17 matches in charge, including three in one demanding week against Aston Villa, Bayer Leverkusen and Brighton, but the temperament required to handle the pressure of a title race. There is a humility there too that players appreciate. Note how he refused to take credit for Liverpool prospering from Villa corners repeatedly on Saturday night and insisted it was all down to the quality and ingenuity of his team. The team is being driven by Slot and the painful experience of blowing up late in last season’s title race. “We should have learned from last year,” said the club captain, Virgil van Dijk. “We’re only in November but I see us dealing with difficult moments pretty well. I can’t predict how the last part of the season will go but so far, so good.” **Andy Hunter**\n\n3\n\nBaleba brilliance the key cog for Brighton\n------------------------------------------\n\nJoão Pedro and Matt O’Riley were the scoring heroes in Brighton’s memorable comeback against Manchester City, but it was the performance of Carlos Baleba in the second half that had home supporters purring in appreciation. The Cameroon midfielder was instrumental in the turnaround after coming on and was the latest evidence of his rapid progress under Fabian Hürzeler having been brought in to replace Moisés Caicedo when he joined Chelsea for a British record fee of £115m last year. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool are all thought to have already shown an interest in Baleba, but would surely have to pay a hefty price for the 20-year-old given Brighton’s reputation for demanding premium fees for their stars. “If there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited,” he said before the City game. “I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.” **Ed Aarons**\n\n4\n\nCan United adapt to Amorim?\n---------------------------\n\nWith Rúben Amorim incoming as Manchester United’s new head coach, the outgoing interim manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, chose not to answer when asked if the Portuguese’s preferred 3-4-3 can be carried out by the current squad. “That is a very good question,” he said. “What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four-game period was to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85% and put in little tweaks and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back. You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside-forwards? I can’t comment on that.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n5\n\nNewcastle subs pushing to start\n-------------------------------\n\nThe substitutes Harvey Barnes and Sandro Tonali taking the game away from Nottingham Forest reminded patience can be a virtue for big-money signings. Neither players’ talent is in doubt but injuries for Barnes and off-field problems – specifically gambling – for Tonali threatened to categorise both players in the “bust” section. “Harvey Barnes did what he does, he’s an outstanding player,” said Eddie Howe. Barnes’ goal was his special move, cutting in from the left to score with his right, an inverse Arjen Robben. Barnes has also been restricted by the pre-eminence of Anthony Gordon but is desperate to achieve his potential in a black-and-white shirt. “I can do what I do from the bench from the beginning,” he pointed out afterwards. Tonali, signed as the world-class midfielder his manager was missing, has a considerable emotional debt to repay Howe and Newcastle. His performance in Nottingham, closing out victory against admittedly tiring Forest legs, suggested he is capable of fulfilling it. **John Brewin**\n\n6\n\nIpswich’s young duo catch the eye\n---------------------------------\n\nIpswich fully merited their landmark win at Spurs and it was a particularly eye-catching afternoon’s work for two of England’s most vaunted young talents. Omari Hutchinson and Liam Delap cost around £35m between them in the summer and, while both still have rough edges, their values are shooting up by the week. Delap’s opportunist effort was his sixth goal of the season and it is hard to think of a 21-year-old centre-forward in the league with equivalent potential. Hutchinson, a bundle of energy who has worked hard on his decision-making, relieved pressure constantly with his running and was near-impossible to dispossess, somehow staying on his feet to help create the winner. Ipswich’s battle against relegation may well go to the wire but, by investing in two players who will surely receive senior international recognition before too long, they have set themselves fair for the future however their season pans out. **Nick Ames**\n\n7\n\nBees need to take home sting on the road\n----------------------------------------\n\nBrentford lost their talisman and main goal threat in the summer when Ivan Toney made the £40m move to the Saudi side Al-Ahli – and yet you’d never know from watching them at the Gtech Community Stadium this season. The fact Toney barely gets a mention these days is a testament to their attacking prowess without him. No team has bagged more home points (16) than the Bees this term and no team has scored more goals (18) while doing so. Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are sharing the scoring burden, netting seven and eight, respectively, to sit among the league’s top five goalscorers. The flipside to all this is Brentford’s rotten away form, failing to pick up a point in five games on the road. By Thomas Frank’s own admission, his team are “not perfect” but they’ll be desperate to find some attacking swagger in their next away game, against Everton after the international break. **DB**\n\n8\n\nTime to clamp down on timeout farce\n-----------------------------------\n\nWith Wolves in trouble and facing repeated attacks, José Sá dropped to the ground calling for medical attention, forcing the referee to call a temporary halt to proceedings as it is impossible to carry on with a goalkeeper out of action. While the Wolves No 1 took a rest and a man with a degree rubbed his leg for a few seconds, his deputy, Sam Johnstone, did not bother to warm up, an indicator that nothing was wrong. As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\n-----------------------------------\n\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n10\n\nWilson: to start or not to start?\n---------------------------------\n\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\n\n    \n    # Raw Quote Text\n    {\"article_metadata\":{\"parent_monitored_url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united\",\"article_url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/11/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\",\"article_headline\":\"Ten talking points from the weekend football\",\"article_text\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n=============== \\n\\nIpswich’s young English duo catch the eye, Liverpool march on and the brilliance of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba\\n\\n1\\n\\nArsenal in need of ruthless edge\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIt took them an hour of huffing and puffing, but Arsenal did something at Stamford Bridge they hadn’t managed since September – they scored an away goal in the Premier League.

As the medical staff jogged across the turf, Wolves’s outfield players headed to the touchline for a huddle and instructions from Gary O’Neil as he looked to change tactics. It seems a ridiculous situation that teams get a time out on false pretences and the officials need to find a way to stop these quasi-farces because it slows the game down and offers an unfair advantage to the team plotting these breaks. **Will Unwin**\\n\\n9\\n\\nSummerville a rare light amid gloom\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nA lot of questions have, understandably, been asked about West Ham’s summer signings: £130m spent on eight permanent signings and two loan deals of which only Aaron Wan-Bissaka has clearly worked. But one of the others, Crysencio Summerville, is beginning to make his mark. He is quick and direct, works hard and has fast feet and, while question marks remain about his decision-making, looks as though he could become a valuable part of the front three. On only his third league start since joining from Leeds in the summer, the Dutch winger was West Ham’s most consistent threat, his effort against the post the closest either they or Everton came. The question is how he can be fitted into a side with Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and a centre-forward, particularly while Lucas Paquetá remains available – but for a side so short of flair and attacking edge, any threat at this stage is worth celebrating. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n10\\n\\nWilson: to start or not to start?\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nWhat does Harry Wilson need to do to start? The question was inevitable once the Welshman slotted in against Crystal Palace, his third goal of the week from the bench. “He is doing the right things,” Marco Silva, Fulham’s manager, said. “He is doing nothing wrong. He is competing against very good players. If I can play with 12 or 13 it’s going to be easier for me, but I can’t.” The predicament is understandable. Fulham’s starting attackers were delightful to watch at Selhurst Park, Raúl Jiménez’s hold-up play complementing the Arsenal-bred trio behind him: Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe. It was Iwobi’s exquisite through-ball that set up Wilson, and the Nigerian international is clearly loved by Silva, who signed him for Everton, too. “Last season was the best season from him in the Premier League. I’m sure that he’s going to be better this season,” Silva added. Wilson may have to be a Solskjær-esque substitute for a little longer. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 11 | 15 | 28 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 11 | 9 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 11 | 8 | 19 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 11 | 6 | 19 |\\n| 5 | Nottm Forest | 11 | 5 | 19 |\\n| 6 | Brighton | 11 | 4 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Fulham | 11 | 3 | 18 |\\n| 8 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 9 | Aston Villa | 11 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Tottenham Hotspur | 11 | 10 | 16 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 11 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 12 | AFC Bournemouth | 11 | 0 | 15 |\\n| 13 | Man Utd | 11 | 0 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Leicester | 11 | -7 | 10 |\\n| 16 | Everton | 11 | -7 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Ipswich | 11 | -10 | 8 |\\n| 18 | Crystal Palace | 11 | -7 | 7 |\\n| 19 | Wolverhampton | 11 | -11 | 6 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 11 | -14 | 4 |\",\"article_date\":\"2024-11-25\"},\"quotes\":[]}\n    \n    # A quote is only valid if...\n    - The raw quote text only contains the words spoken by a named speaker and not the text written by the author of the article.

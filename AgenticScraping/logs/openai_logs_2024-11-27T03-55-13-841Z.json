The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\\n\\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\\n\\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\\n\\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United transfer news LIVE: Viktor Gyokeres update, New striker

The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\\n\\nManchester United spent £8.6m sacking staff in Jim Ratcliffe cost-cutting drive\\n===============================================================================\\n\\n*   Club made 250 members of staff redundant in summer\\n*   Total debt rises to £714m after £200m transfer spend\\n\\nManchester United spent £8.6m on redundancies in the first quarter of its financial year due to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s drive to reduce the workforce from around 1,000 by 250, the club’s latest accounts show.\\n\\nRatcliffe, the largest minority shareholder, [began pruning the 250 jobs in July](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/sir-jim-ratcliffe-cuts-250-jobs-to-save-manchester-united-about-10m-a-year), a decision aimed at cutting United costs. Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\\n\\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\\n\\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\\n\\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s [1-1 draw at Ipswich](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report). Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\\n\\n[Analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis)\\n\\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\\n\\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\\n\\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the Europa League have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\n\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\n\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\n\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Jamie Redknapp, meanwhile, was heard telling the group to \"just leave it\".\n\nNow, season ticket holder Neil Finbow, 55, has given a further insight into the row after standing right next to the former Manchester United captain as the incident played out.\n\n\"It was the guy in the middle's comments that got him, I think,\" Finbow told The Mirror. \"He was going on about his time when he was manager, how he treated his kids.\"\n\nFinbow continued: \"I will sort of defend Roy Keane here as well, because it may be that the comment 'I'll see you in the car park' is to talk to the guy rather than take him out, so it can be misconstrued. I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\n\n\"The guy had an issue, when [Keane] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that. So obviously that's been pent-up.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't have any regrets [about going down the front]. It's pent-up anger. No swear words came out of my mouth, I just said 'you're a better pundit than you are a manager'.\"\n\nSky Sports will reportedly investigate the incident to see if any action is needed, while Finbow admits he is concerned about the future of his season ticket.\n\n\"Everyone I sit with knows what I'm like,\" he said. \"I'm in the family bit there, I've been there for years. I do worry about my season ticket, someone has put on there that it could affect it, but I don't think I've been abusive or anything. If people class that as abuse then it's just gone mad.\"\n\nFinbow added: \"I want my side to be heard, that it was more sarcasm than anything. To be fair, he's provoked it by coming over, hasn't he? I was actually saying 'calm down, Roy', funnily enough, which I've been telling a lot of my friends to do this morning.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\n\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\n\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he \\[Amorim\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\[as the left wing-back\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\n=======================================================================\n\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\n\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\n\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross.

United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he \\[Amorim\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\n=======================================================================\n\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\n\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\n\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\n=======================================================================\n\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\n\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\n\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’.

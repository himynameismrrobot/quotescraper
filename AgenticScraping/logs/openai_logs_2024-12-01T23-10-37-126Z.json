Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 53: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

With [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\\n\\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['Be amazed' - Amorim has proven United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United can start their Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\nThere had been a lot of speculation about [Mazraoui's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\\n\\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\\n\\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\\n\\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\\\" he said. \\\"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three

It has been claimed that Juventus are at the front of the queue for the Dutchman after the 23-year-old helped fire Thiago Motta's Bologna to the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).\\n\\nZirkzee has endured a difficult start in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league), despite netting on his competitive debut. He failed to inspire United to victory in the Portuguese's first game in charge as they were forced to settle for a draw against Ipswich Town.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nThe report from Italy, via [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/contact-now-made-as-big-manchester-united-january-exit-makes-front-page/), has suggested that comments from Amorim in light of the stalemate have captured the attention of the press in the region. It has been claimed that Motta is tracking Zirkzee's progress with 'great interest'.\\n\\nCorriere dello Sport has reported that Juventus will be at the forefront of interest surrounding the forward with the future surrounding Dusan Vlahovic unclear with the 24-year-old heading into the final 18 months of his contract.\\n\\nAmorim's reflections from his first game in the dugout were particularly scathing as he highlighted his concerns. He said: \\\"I think that \\\\[decision-making\\\\] is a concern, you don’t need to coach them at this level.\\n\\n\\\"You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you \\\\[have to\\\\] put the ball in front. Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers.\\n\\n\\\"Josh \\\\[Zirkzee\\\\] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses. So we are doing some things that were not at the right moment, so that is something we have to address.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United prepare fresh Chido Obi-Martin 'move' after Arsenal

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\\n\\n\\\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\\n\\n\\\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 2: Image credit: Sky Sports/X](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0542222d6dee7723/67458635803d5c87b49cea3c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_08.11.18.png)\\n\\nImage credit: Sky Sports/X\\n\\nHe added: \\\"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\\n\\n\\\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim added: \\\"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nThoughts on Amorim's first game in charge as United manager?

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) midfielder recounted moments of emotional struggle, claiming there were times when she '[had to go into the bathroom to cry](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/compared-george-best-man-united-30380963)' during training sessions.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad in the summer of 2023, joined United in September that year but faced a tough season marred by a knee injury. Guerrero made only seven appearances across all competitions for Marc Skinner’s team, [starting just once before moving on to Mexican side America in July](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30381504).\\n\\nSpeaking to Marca, as quoted by the PA news agency, Guerrero expressed her frustration. She said: \\\"I did everything in my power to get a chance, but when the weeks go by and you don’t get it, you see how small you are. When I returned to training in January (after the injury), I had minutes in some games between January and March, but [then there is a period where I don’t play at all](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/paul-pogba-next-club-plan-30379858).\\\"\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Van Nistelrooy breaks his silence on United exit with emotional message to fans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-breaks-silence-30379808)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim could hand United fan favourite a new role after £17m bargain](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-could-hand-manchester-30377449)**\\n\\nGuerrero also touched upon the difficulties of not being given a fair opportunity to prove herself. She said: \\\"I fully understand that a coach may like one profile of player more than another and that’s absolutely fine, but being denied the opportunity to show your level or potential and then see if it fits into your game model or not...\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Irene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30383727.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2153224300.jpg)\\n\\nIrene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session (Image: Charlotte Tattersall - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe former United midfielder admitted the mental toll this situation took on her, questioning the club's intentions. Guerrero said: \\\"It was difficult for me to accept at that time. I asked myself. ‘Why are you coming to sign me, pay a transfer fee and give a player in exchange if you don’t count on me later?’\\n\\n\\\"Mentally reconciling that was not easy. The support I had from my family and my partner helped me to see the positive side and get down to work. When I hit rock bottom I started to approach it in a different way.\\n\\n\\\"I had moments of weakness, of not understanding why I had left a place where I was doing well and believed I could compete to go to a club where they were denying me as a footballer.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero acknowledged the lessons she learned and expressed gratitude for the support. She added: \\\"I learned another facet of football, but I took with me very good team-mates who made me feel at home and an experience that forges you as a person and as an athlete.\\n\\n\\\"I remember days when, halfway through training, I had to go into the bathroom to cry, wash my face and come out as if nothing had happened. I tried not to let anyone notice and not to affect the team, but I had a very important, very hard mental limit.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero described the moments she contemplated giving up. She said: \\\"I also went through moments of sending everything to hell, especially when I got home and said to my partner, ‘I want to go home, I don’t want to be here. I’m not enjoying myself, I’m not happy and I feel like everything I’ve sacrificed to come to another country is not worth it.'\\n\\n\\\"The reward for the effort and work I’m doing on a day-to-day basis is zero. I focused on working harder. I trained with the team in the morning and in the afternoon I went to the gym to be stronger and better prepare myself for what might come in the future. I wanted to be ready both mentally and physically to be able to show that Irene Guerrero is still around for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nUnited declined to comment on the matter when contacted by the PA news agency.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) midfielder recounted moments of emotional struggle, claiming there were times when she '[had to go into the bathroom to cry](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/compared-george-best-man-united-30380963)' during training sessions.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad in the summer of 2023, joined United in September that year but faced a tough season marred by a knee injury. Guerrero made only seven appearances across all competitions for Marc Skinner’s team, [starting just once before moving on to Mexican side America in July](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30381504).\\n\\nSpeaking to Marca, as quoted by the PA news agency, Guerrero expressed her frustration. She said: \\\"I did everything in my power to get a chance, but when the weeks go by and you don’t get it, you see how small you are. When I returned to training in January (after the injury), I had minutes in some games between January and March, but [then there is a period where I don’t play at all](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/paul-pogba-next-club-plan-30379858).\\\"\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Van Nistelrooy breaks his silence on United exit with emotional message to fans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-breaks-silence-30379808)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim could hand United fan favourite a new role after £17m bargain](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-could-hand-manchester-30377449)**\\n\\nGuerrero also touched upon the difficulties of not being given a fair opportunity to prove herself. She said: \\\"I fully understand that a coach may like one profile of player more than another and that’s absolutely fine, but being denied the opportunity to show your level or potential and then see if it fits into your game model or not...\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Irene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30383727.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2153224300.jpg)\\n\\nIrene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session (Image: Charlotte Tattersall - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe former United midfielder admitted the mental toll this situation took on her, questioning the club's intentions. Guerrero said: \\\"It was difficult for me to accept at that time. I asked myself. ‘Why are you coming to sign me, pay a transfer fee and give a player in exchange if you don’t count on me later?’\\n\\n\\\"Mentally reconciling that was not easy. The support I had from my family and my partner helped me to see the positive side and get down to work. When I hit rock bottom I started to approach it in a different way.\\n\\n\\\"I had moments of weakness, of not understanding why I had left a place where I was doing well and believed I could compete to go to a club where they were denying me as a footballer.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero acknowledged the lessons she learned and expressed gratitude for the support. She added: \\\"I learned another facet of football, but I took with me very good team-mates who made me feel at home and an experience that forges you as a person and as an athlete.\\n\\n\\\"I remember days when, halfway through training, I had to go into the bathroom to cry, wash my face and come out as if nothing had happened. I tried not to let anyone notice and not to affect the team, but I had a very important, very hard mental limit.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero described the moments she contemplated giving up. She said: \\\"I also went through moments of sending everything to hell, especially when I got home and said to my partner, ‘I want to go home, I don’t want to be here. I’m not enjoying myself, I’m not happy and I feel like everything I’ve sacrificed to come to another country is not worth it.'\\n\\n\\\"The reward for the effort and work I’m doing on a day-to-day basis is zero. I focused on working harder. I trained with the team in the morning and in the afternoon I went to the gym to be stronger and better prepare myself for what might come in the future. I wanted to be ready both mentally and physically to be able to show that Irene Guerrero is still around for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nUnited declined to comment on the matter when contacted by the PA news agency.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) midfielder recounted moments of emotional struggle, claiming there were times when she '[had to go into the bathroom to cry](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/compared-george-best-man-united-30380963)' during training sessions.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad in the summer of 2023, joined United in September that year but faced a tough season marred by a knee injury. Guerrero made only seven appearances across all competitions for Marc Skinner’s team, [starting just once before moving on to Mexican side America in July](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30381504).\\n\\nSpeaking to Marca, as quoted by the PA news agency, Guerrero expressed her frustration. She said: \\\"I did everything in my power to get a chance, but when the weeks go by and you don’t get it, you see how small you are. When I returned to training in January (after the injury), I had minutes in some games between January and March, but [then there is a period where I don’t play at all](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/paul-pogba-next-club-plan-30379858).\\\"\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Van Nistelrooy breaks his silence on United exit with emotional message to fans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-breaks-silence-30379808)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim could hand United fan favourite a new role after £17m bargain](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-could-hand-manchester-30377449)**\\n\\nGuerrero also touched upon the difficulties of not being given a fair opportunity to prove herself. She said: \\\"I fully understand that a coach may like one profile of player more than another and that’s absolutely fine, but being denied the opportunity to show your level or potential and then see if it fits into your game model or not...\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Irene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30383727.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2153224300.jpg)\\n\\nIrene Guerrero during a Manchester United training session (Image: Charlotte Tattersall - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe former United midfielder admitted the mental toll this situation took on her, questioning the club's intentions. Guerrero said: \\\"It was difficult for me to accept at that time. I asked myself. ‘Why are you coming to sign me, pay a transfer fee and give a player in exchange if you don’t count on me later?’\\n\\n\\\"Mentally reconciling that was not easy. The support I had from my family and my partner helped me to see the positive side and get down to work. When I hit rock bottom I started to approach it in a different way.\\n\\n\\\"I had moments of weakness, of not understanding why I had left a place where I was doing well and believed I could compete to go to a club where they were denying me as a footballer.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero acknowledged the lessons she learned and expressed gratitude for the support. She added: \\\"I learned another facet of football, but I took with me very good team-mates who made me feel at home and an experience that forges you as a person and as an athlete.\\n\\n\\\"I remember days when, halfway through training, I had to go into the bathroom to cry, wash my face and come out as if nothing had happened. I tried not to let anyone notice and not to affect the team, but I had a very important, very hard mental limit.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero described the moments she contemplated giving up. She said: \\\"I also went through moments of sending everything to hell, especially when I got home and said to my partner, ‘I want to go home, I don’t want to be here. I’m not enjoying myself, I’m not happy and I feel like everything I’ve sacrificed to come to another country is not worth it.'\\n\\n\\\"The reward for the effort and work I’m doing on a day-to-day basis is zero. I focused on working harder. I trained with the team in the morning and in the afternoon I went to the gym to be stronger and better prepare myself for what might come in the future. I wanted to be ready both mentally and physically to be able to show that Irene Guerrero is still around for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nUnited declined to comment on the matter when contacted by the PA news agency.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) midfielder recounted moments of emotional struggle, claiming there were times when she '[had to go into the bathroom to cry](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/compared-george-best-man-united-30380963)' during training sessions.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who was part of Spain's World Cup-winning squad in the summer of 2023, joined United in September that year but faced a tough season marred by a knee injury. Guerrero made only seven appearances across all competitions for Marc Skinner’s team, [starting just once before moving on to Mexican side America in July](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30381504).\\n\\nSpeaking to Marca, as quoted by the PA news agency, Guerrero expressed her frustration. She said: \\\"I did everything in my power to get a chance, but when the weeks go by and you don’t get it, you see how small you are. When I returned to training in January (after the injury), I had minutes in some games between January and March, but [then there is a period where I don’t play at all](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/paul-pogba-next-club-plan-30379858).\\\"\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Van Nistelrooy breaks his silence on United exit with emotional message to fans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-breaks-silence-30379808)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim could hand United fan favourite a new role after £17m bargain](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-could-hand-manchester-30377449)**\\n\\nGuerrero also touched upon the difficulties of not being given a fair opportunity to prove herself.

Guerrero said: \\\"It was difficult for me to accept at that time. I asked myself. ‘Why are you coming to sign me, pay a transfer fee and give a player in exchange if you don’t count on me later?’\\n\\n\\\"Mentally reconciling that was not easy. The support I had from my family and my partner helped me to see the positive side and get down to work. When I hit rock bottom I started to approach it in a different way.\\n\\n\\\"I had moments of weakness, of not understanding why I had left a place where I was doing well and believed I could compete to go to a club where they were denying me as a footballer.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero acknowledged the lessons she learned and expressed gratitude for the support. She added: \\\"I learned another facet of football, but I took with me very good team-mates who made me feel at home and an experience that forges you as a person and as an athlete.\\n\\n\\\"I remember days when, halfway through training, I had to go into the bathroom to cry, wash my face and come out as if nothing had happened. I tried not to let anyone notice and not to affect the team, but I had a very important, very hard mental limit.\\\"\\n\\nGuerrero described the moments she contemplated giving up. She said: \\\"I also went through moments of sending everything to hell, especially when I got home and said to my partner, ‘I want to go home, I don’t want to be here. I’m not enjoying myself, I’m not happy and I feel like everything I’ve sacrificed to come to another country is not worth it.'\\n\\n\\\"The reward for the effort and work I’m doing on a day-to-day basis is zero. I focused on working harder. I trained with the team in the morning and in the afternoon I went to the gym to be stronger and better prepare myself for what might come in the future. I wanted to be ready both mentally and physically to be able to show that Irene Guerrero is still around for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nUnited declined to comment on the matter when contacted by the PA news agency.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

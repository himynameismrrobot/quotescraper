I feel a bit sorry for their new manager Ruben Amorim because he needs time, and two or three transfer windows, to put things right.\\n    \\n    There was a lot of excitement over the way they started his first game in charge, against [Ipswich](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town), but blimey you have got a problem if the Tractor Boys are out-playing you, which is what happened in the end.\\n    \\n    Things got worse for Amorim when Ed Sheeran interrupted his interview on Sky afterwards. I have to give credit to commentator Conor McNamara here, but maybe it is time for Amorim to listen to one of Sheeran's biggest hits and think about 'the shape of Man U'.\\n    \\n    I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield.\\n    \\n    As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they couldn't find a way past 10-man [Brentford](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) last week.\\n    \\n    This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this Manchester United team is going to take a while to click.\\n    \\n    Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford - the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n    \\n    I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he's in the Manchester United madhouse now and he's about to find out what it's like to be under the microscope every single week.\\n    \\n    **Sunny's prediction: 3-0**\\n    \\n    Manchester United haven't been great, but I think they are going to play well in this one.\\n    \\n    [Read the full predictions and have your say here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko)\\n    \\n14.

Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 54: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Player ratings vs Everton as Amad brilliant](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\\n\\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\\n\\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \\\"Five Cantonas\\\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\\n\\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\\n\\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\\n\\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \\\"Olé\\\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\\n\\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\\n\\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\\n\\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\\n\\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\\n\\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\\n\\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\\n\\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\\n\\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\\n\\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\\n\\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\nUnited were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**[Click here to read Samuel Luckhurst's match report in full](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/amad-responds-perfectly-ruben-amorims-30490976)**.\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491258.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/0_GettyImages-2187191022.jpg)\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments1](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n15:28KEY EVENT\\n\\n### PLAYER RATINGS: Amad brilliant as United put Everton to the sword\\n\\nUnited recorded their biggest Premier League victory of the season with a 4-0 win over Everton at Old Trafford this afternoon.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee each helped themselves to a brace, both scoring either side of half-time, to secure the first Premier League win of the Ruben Amorim era.\\n\\nHere is a flavour of how Samuel Luckhurst rated United's players out of 10...\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet.

The game was suspended after 25 minutes with Bove stretchered off and taken to hospital.\\n\\nDe Gea, who joined the Italian side over the summer and has played 10 times in Serie A alongside Bove, started the game. [He was among those who were extremely worried on the field after Bove fell to the ground.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fiorentina-vs-inter-suspended-david-30492772)\\n\\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \\\"God Please (prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\\n\\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\\n\\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\\n\\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nFellow ex-Manchester United star Paul Pogba was among others to offer their support. \\\"Forza @edo\\\\_bove \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\" he wrote on his Instagram story with a blank background. Former [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) striker Mario Balotelli did the same. He wrote: \\\"@edo\\\\_bove Prego di rivederti così al più presto Ti abbraccio forte \\\\[bicep emoji\\\\]\\\", which translates as, \\\"I pray to see you again as soon as possible I hug you tightly.\\\"\\n\\nRomelu Lukaku and Tammy Abraham, who were both at Roma last season but now play at Napoli and AC Milan respectively, have also posted to their Instagram stories for Bove.\\n\\nBove has played 11 league games for La Viola this season, winning the last seven he has started alongside De Gea. The pair have only failed to win twice when playing together, only one was a defeat.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Fiorentina vs Inter suspended as David de Gea teammate Edoardo Bove

better of an Everton side that has won just one of six away league games this season. But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

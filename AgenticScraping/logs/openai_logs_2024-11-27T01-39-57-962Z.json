The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\\n\\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\\n\\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited, of course, participated in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\\n\\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\\n\\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \\\"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\\n\\n\\\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to the top of domestic and European football. Our cost and headcount reductions remain on track, and we are pleased to have seen further commercial traction, and welcome new partner Heineken, through their Tiger brand. Our renovation of the [Carrington](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/carrington) Training Centre is progressing well, while the [Old

digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\\n\\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\\n\\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited, of course, participated in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\\n\\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\\n\\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \\\"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\\n\\n\\\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to the top of domestic and European football. Our cost and headcount reductions remain on track, and we are pleased to have seen further commercial traction, and welcome new partner Heineken, through their Tiger brand. Our renovation of the [Carrington](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/carrington) Training Centre is progressing well, while the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) Regeneration Task Force continues its work.\\n\\n\\\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\\n\\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\\n\\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited, of course, participated in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\\n\\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\\n\\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \\\"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\\n\\n\\\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to the top of domestic and European football. Our cost and headcount reductions remain on track, and we are pleased to have seen further commercial traction, and welcome new partner Heineken, through their Tiger brand. Our renovation of the [Carrington](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/carrington) Training Centre is progressing well, while the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) Regeneration Task Force continues its work.\\n\\n\\\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have

United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\\n\\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\\n\\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited, of course, participated in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\\n\\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\\n\\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \\\"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\\n\\n\\\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to the top of domestic and European football.

digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have

United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\\n\\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\\n\\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited, of course, participated in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\\n\\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\\n\\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\\n\\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \\\"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\\n\\n\\\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to the top of domestic and European football.

digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\\n\\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\\n\\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\\n\\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\\n\\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\\n\\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\\n\\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\\n\\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\\n\\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\\n\\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\\n\\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\\n\\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would hebe given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\\n\\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\\n\\n\\\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\\\" said Amass in the summer.\\n\\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\\n\\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\\n\\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\\n\\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\\n\\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\\n\\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\\n\\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\\n\\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\\n\\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\\n\\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\\n\\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\\n\\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would hebe given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\\n\\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\\n\\n\\\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\\\" said Amass in the summer.\\n\\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\\n\\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\\n\\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\\n\\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\\n\\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\\n\\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\\n\\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\\n\\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\\n\\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\\n\\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\\n\\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\\n\\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would hebe given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\\n\\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\\n\\n\\\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\\\" said Amass in the summer.\\n\\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\\n\\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\\n\\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\\n\\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\\n\\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\\n\\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\\n\\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\\n\\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\\n\\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\\n\\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\\n\\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\\n\\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would hebe given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\\n\\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\\n\\n\\\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\\\" said Amass in the summer.\\n\\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important

[Sources indicated earlier this year that the task force hoped to conclude their findings by the end of 2024](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-reveal-very-positive-29600940).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited have consulted supporters during the process and earlier this month [shared the results of a survey they distributed to season ticket holders, United members and executive club members](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/world-class-manchester-united-reveal-30299695). Fifty-two per cent of those who participated said they are in favour of a new stadium being constructed.\\n\\nIssuing a fresh update on the landscape of the situation, Berrada has confirmed the task force is still conducting its investigation and it will not be until that is complete that United will then consider their plans.\\n\\n\\\"Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work,\\\" said Berrada.\\n\\n\\\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nIn March, Ratcliffe outlined his preference to build a new stadium, saying the club had the 'opportunity' to build a new arena that could house up to 100,000 supporters.\\n\\n\\\"It needs to have a stadium that's befitting the club and the brand,\\\" Ratcliffe told the [Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jp0G27S1yAe5FkBQqYkaC?si=95822aaf6ff14fc3&nd=1&dlsi=d33da2679a144d8c). \\\"That might have been the case 20 years ago, but it isn't today.\\n\\n\\\"I mean we can refurbish the ground and we'll do a really nice job of that, it will be a fantastic stadium. And that would cost about a billion \\\\[pounds\\\\] to do that and the club can shoulder that burden.\\n\\n\\\"But you have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground because we have got enough space to build a completely new ground. If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state of the art, world-class, 90,000 or maybe even 100,000 (capacity).\\\"\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

[Sources indicated earlier this year that the task force hoped to conclude their findings by the end of 2024](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-reveal-very-positive-29600940).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nUnited have consulted supporters during the process and earlier this month [shared the results of a survey they distributed to season ticket holders, United members and executive club members](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/world-class-manchester-united-reveal-30299695). Fifty-two per cent of those who participated said they are in favour of a new stadium being constructed.\\n\\nIssuing a fresh update on the landscape of the situation, Berrada has confirmed the task force is still conducting its investigation and it will not be until that is complete that United will then consider their plans.\\n\\n\\\"Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work,\\\" said Berrada.\\n\\n\\\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nIn March, Ratcliffe outlined his preference to build a new stadium, saying the club had the 'opportunity' to build a new arena that could house up to 100,000 supporters.\\n\\n\\\"It needs to have a stadium that's befitting the club and the brand,\\\" Ratcliffe told the [Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jp0G27S1yAe5FkBQqYkaC?si=95822aaf6ff14fc3&nd=1&dlsi=d33da2679a144d8c). \\\"That might have been the case 20 years ago, but it isn't today.\\n\\n\\\"I mean we can refurbish the ground and we'll do a really nice job of that, it will be a fantastic stadium. And that would cost about a billion \\\\[pounds\\\\] to do that and the club can shoulder that burden.\\n\\n\\\"But you have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground because we have got enough space to build a completely new ground. If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state of the art, world-class, 90,000 or maybe even 100,000 (capacity).\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United confirm first

Fifty-two per cent of those who participated said they are in favour of a new stadium being constructed.\\n\\nIssuing a fresh update on the landscape of the situation, Berrada has confirmed the task force is still conducting its investigation and it will not be until that is complete that United will then consider their plans.\\n\\n\\\"Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work,\\\" said Berrada.\\n\\n\\\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\\\"\\n\\nIn March, Ratcliffe outlined his preference to build a new stadium, saying the club had the 'opportunity' to build a new arena that could house up to 100,000 supporters.\\n\\n\\\"It needs to have a stadium that's befitting the club and the brand,\\\" Ratcliffe told the [Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jp0G27S1yAe5FkBQqYkaC?si=95822aaf6ff14fc3&nd=1&dlsi=d33da2679a144d8c). \\\"That might have been the case 20 years ago, but it isn't today.\\n\\n\\\"I mean we can refurbish the ground and we'll do a really nice job of that, it will be a fantastic stadium. And that would cost about a billion \\\\[pounds\\\\] to do that and the club can shoulder that burden.\\n\\n\\\"But you have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground because we have got enough space to build a completely new ground.

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United's rising star might have to abandon his Old Trafford

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United's rising star might have to abandon his Old Trafford

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThat particular trip to Merseyside will always be remembered most for [Alejandro Garnacho's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho) stunning acrobatic effort just three minutes in. However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 61: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 62: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United's rising star might have to abandon his Old Trafford

It was reported by the [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-weighing-up-50m-33435569) in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\\n\\nUnited were reportedly considering a £50million bid to sign Ferguson, who scored six goals in 36 appearances last season. Brighton were reported to value Ferguson at £60million at the time, but now their stance has seemingly changed.\\n\\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/) has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season. After valuing the 20-year-old at £60million just three months ago, it seems that the Seagulls want to give Ferguson more playing time after giving him just nine appearances with three starts under new manager Fabian Hurzeler.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nUnited have been heavily linked with signing a striker in recent months, and the update on Ferguson's future could be the perfect opportunity for the club to strengthen a key position. However, the signing of Ferguson could present questions for two members of the United squad.\\n\\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current centre forward options, but have scored just three goals between them this season. Zirkzee was signed by United last summer from Bologna in a deal worth up to €42.5million (£35.5million).\\n\\nShould United sign Ferguson, then it would leave United with a decision to make regarding the futures of Zirkzee and Hojlund. In Zirkzee's case, the striker has been linked with a loan move away from Old Trafford when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\\n\\nFerguson would perform in a centre-forward role for United, likely with two wide forwards on either wing. They could be Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo or Antony, who are all options to play in the forward areas.\\n\\n**_Potential United line-up after Evan Ferguson signing:_** _Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Fernandes, Ferguson, Garnacho_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It was reported by the [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-weighing-up-50m-33435569) in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\\n\\nUnited were reportedly considering a £50million bid to sign Ferguson, who scored six goals in 36 appearances last season. Brighton were reported to value Ferguson at £60million at the time, but now their stance has seemingly changed.\\n\\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/) has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season. After valuing the 20-year-old at £60million just three months ago, it seems that the Seagulls want to give Ferguson more playing time after giving him just nine appearances with three starts under new manager Fabian Hurzeler.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nUnited have been heavily linked with signing a striker in recent months, and the update on Ferguson's future could be the perfect opportunity for the club to strengthen a key position. However, the signing of Ferguson could present questions for two members of the United squad.\\n\\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current centre forward options, but have scored just three goals between them this season. Zirkzee was signed by United last summer from Bologna in a deal worth up to €42.5million (£35.5million).\\n\\nShould United sign Ferguson, then it would leave United with a decision to make regarding the futures of Zirkzee and Hojlund. In Zirkzee's case, the striker has been linked with a loan move away from Old Trafford when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\\n\\nFerguson would perform in a centre-forward role for United, likely with two wide forwards on either wing. They could be Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo or Antony, who are all options to play in the forward areas.\\n\\n**_Potential United line-up after Evan Ferguson signing:_** _Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Fernandes, Ferguson, Garnacho_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Brighton were reported to value Ferguson at £60million at the time, but now their stance has seemingly changed.\\n\\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/) has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season. After valuing the 20-year-old at £60million just three months ago, it seems that the Seagulls want to give Ferguson more playing time after giving him just nine appearances with three starts under new manager Fabian Hurzeler.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nUnited have been heavily linked with signing a striker in recent months, and the update on Ferguson's future could be the perfect opportunity for the club to strengthen a key position. However, the signing of Ferguson could present questions for two members of the United squad.\\n\\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current centre forward options, but have scored just three goals between them this season. Zirkzee was signed by United last summer from Bologna in a deal worth up to €42.5million (£35.5million).\\n\\nShould United sign Ferguson, then it would leave United with a decision to make regarding the futures of Zirkzee and Hojlund. In Zirkzee's case, the striker has been linked with a loan move away from Old Trafford when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\\n\\nFerguson would perform in a centre-forward role for United, likely with two wide forwards on either wing. They could be Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo or Antony, who are all options to play in the forward areas.\\n\\n**_Potential United line-up after Evan Ferguson signing:_** _Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Fernandes, Ferguson, Garnacho_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It was reported by the [Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-weighing-up-50m-33435569) in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\\n\\nUnited were reportedly considering a £50million bid to sign Ferguson, who scored six goals in 36 appearances last season. Brighton were reported to value Ferguson at £60million at the time, but now their stance has seemingly changed.\\n\\n[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/) has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season. After valuing the 20-year-old at £60million just three months ago, it seems that the Seagulls want to give Ferguson more playing time after giving him just nine appearances with three starts under new manager Fabian Hurzeler.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nUnited have been heavily linked with signing a striker in recent months, and the update on Ferguson's future could be the perfect opportunity for the club to strengthen a key position. However, the signing of Ferguson could present questions for two members of the United squad.\\n\\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current centre forward options, but have scored just three goals between them this season. Zirkzee was signed by United last summer from Bologna in a deal worth up to €42.5million (£35.5million).\\n\\nShould United sign Ferguson, then it would leave United with a decision to make regarding the futures of Zirkzee and Hojlund. In Zirkzee's case, the striker has been linked with a loan move away from Old Trafford when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\\n\\nFerguson would perform in a centre-forward role for United, likely with two wide forwards on either wing. They could be Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo or Antony, who are all options to play in the forward areas.\\n\\n**_Potential United line-up after Evan Ferguson signing:_** _Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Fernandes, Ferguson, Garnacho_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and [interest Geovany Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/geovany-quenda-transfer-latest-man-30420012) are out of the question.\\n\\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\\n\\n22:52Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Arsenal send clear Ruben Amorim message\\n\\nManchester United may well have appointed the next big thing in management judging by how Sporting CP's first Champions League game without Ruben Amorim played out.\\n\\nIn his last home clash, the Portuguese champions beat Manchester City 4-1. However, just a few weeks later they were on the end of a battering by an English team. Arsenal rocked up to Jose Alvalade Stadium following a comfortable 3-0 victory against Nottingham Forest and again showed their attacking power.\\n\\nAt half time, it was 3-0 to the Gunners with the final score being 5-1, though it could have been much more. While Sporting were missing key players, it is telling how they got on without Amorim at the helm against elite-level opposition.\\n\\nAs such, it seems clear that Amorim is a very talented coach and given time will be able to bring success back to Old Trafford.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article30453983.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_SOCCER_Ipswich_10015209.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim (Image: (Bradley Collyer/PA Wire))\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n21:41Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Strongest United line-up with Ferguson\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) may have been handed a major boost ahead of the January transfer window.\\n\\nUnited have been linked with several potential new signings in recent months, with one of them being Brighton striker Evan Ferguson.

Victor Boniface (Image: Jörg Schüler/Bayer 04 Leverkusen via Getty Images)\\n\\nHello and welcome to our Manchester United live blog on Tuesday, November 26.\\n\\nLast weekend, Ruben Amorim's tenure at United started with a 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town. After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and [interest Geovany Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/geovany-quenda-transfer-latest-man-30420012) are out of the question.\\n\\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\\n\\n22:52Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Arsenal send clear Ruben Amorim message\\n\\nManchester United may well have appointed the next big thing in management judging by how Sporting CP's first Champions League game without Ruben Amorim played out.\\n\\nIn his last home clash, the Portuguese champions beat Manchester City 4-1. However, just a few weeks later they were on the end of a battering by an English team. Arsenal rocked up to Jose Alvalade Stadium following a comfortable 3-0 victory against Nottingham Forest and again showed their attacking power.\\n\\nAt half time, it was 3-0 to the Gunners with the final score being 5-1, though it could have been much more. While Sporting were missing key players, it is telling how they got on without Amorim at the helm against elite-level opposition.\\n\\nAs such, it seems clear that Amorim is a very talented coach and given time will be able to bring success back to Old Trafford.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article30453983.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_SOCCER_Ipswich_10015209.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim (Image: (Bradley Collyer/PA Wire))\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n21:41Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Strongest United line-up with Ferguson\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) may have been handed a major boost ahead of the January transfer window.\\n\\nUnited have been linked with several potential new signings in recent months, with one of them being Brighton striker Evan Ferguson.

Victor Boniface (Image: Jörg Schüler/Bayer 04 Leverkusen via Getty Images)\\n\\nHello and welcome to our Manchester United live blog on Tuesday, November 26.\\n\\nLast weekend, Ruben Amorim's tenure at United started with a 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town. After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and [interest Geovany Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/geovany-quenda-transfer-latest-man-30420012) are out of the question.\\n\\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\\n\\n22:52Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Arsenal send clear Ruben Amorim message\\n\\nManchester United may well have appointed the next big thing in management judging by how Sporting CP's first Champions League game without Ruben Amorim played out.\\n\\nIn his last home clash, the Portuguese champions beat Manchester City 4-1. However, just a few weeks later they were on the end of a battering by an English team. Arsenal rocked up to Jose Alvalade Stadium following a comfortable 3-0 victory against Nottingham Forest and again showed their attacking power.\\n\\nAt half time, it was 3-0 to the Gunners with the final score being 5-1, though it could have been much more. While Sporting were missing key players, it is telling how they got on without Amorim at the helm against elite-level opposition.\\n\\nAs such, it seems clear that Amorim is a very talented coach and given time will be able to bring success back to Old Trafford.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article30453983.ece/ALTERNATES/s510b/1_SOCCER_Ipswich_10015209.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim (Image: (Bradley Collyer/PA Wire))\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n21:41Kieran Horn\\n\\n### Strongest United line-up with Ferguson\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) may have been handed a major boost ahead of the January transfer window.\\n\\nUnited have been linked with several potential new signings in recent months, with one of them being Brighton striker Evan Ferguson.

But you watch them play, even yesterday, in the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league.\\n> \\n> \\\"They looked more organised, \\\\[like they had a\\\\] better coach, they looked like they had more appetite for the game and more enthusiasm. And that's a constant, and it has been a constant, not just, obviously, on Sunday, but a constant for the last year and a half, two years, three years.\\n> \\n> \\\"So we've got a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one.

It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) led to uncertainty over van Nistelrooy’s future, and it was announced on the new head coach’s first day at the club that he would be leaving. It now seems that [van Nistelrooy is set for a quick return to coaching](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30450187).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [New Man United financial figures highlight major issue INEOS have to solve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-man-united-financial-figures-30457666)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sir Alex Ferguson made me promise when I joined Man United - he broke it for Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alex-ferguson-liverpool-man-utd-30457621)**\\n\\nFollowing the sacking of Steve Cooper, the Dutchman is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Leicester. If it does happen, a reunion withe United will be on the cards in March when they travel to the King Power Stadium.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy;s relationship with United could potentially benefit both clubs, especially with the January transfer window not far away. With that in mind, here are four United players that the former coach could potentially sign with his new club.\\n\\n#### Harry Maguire\\n\\nThe centre-back’s time at United looks to be coming to an end, so could a return to his former club be a possibility? Maguire joined United from Leiceter in the summer of 2019 for a fee of £80 million after two successful seasons at the club, where he also established himself as an England regular.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old has just six months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford. So he can either be sold for a reduced fee in January, or move on for nothing in the summer.\\n\\nLeicester do have Conor Coady and Jannik Vestergaard as the more experienced centre-back options, but could turn to Maguire if they want to add to their backline.\\n\\n#### Toby Collyer\\n\\nThe 20-year-old has broken into the squad this season, making an appearance in the second half of the 3-0 defeat against Liverpool back in September. He has however, struggled for appearances since then and has not made the squad in the last seven Premier League games.\\n\\nA loan move for more game time, and if that could come with a Premier League club like Leicester, then all the better. The Foxes do however have both of their loan slots taken up, it would mean that they would have to either send back or arrange a permanent deal for the two players currently on loan to do another temporary deal.\\n\\n#### Antony\\n\\nAntony has failed to live up to his price tag at United since making the move from Ajax in 2022. United paid an initial £82 million fee to bring him to Old Trafford.\\n\\nIt has however been rumoured that they could look to move the winger on in the upcoming transfer window. To do that, it will either have to be for a greatly reduced price, or on a loan deal.\\n\\nIf United could send him on loan to a fellow Premier League club and he refinds his form and confidence. His return would either help him start again at the club, or increase his asking price in the summer window.\\n\\n#### Ethan Wheatley\\n\\nLeicester are expected to be on the lookout for another forward in the January window, and that could be the case even more if van Nistelrooy is in charge. If they have a loan slot available, then on possibility could be young United striker Ethan Wheatley.\\n\\nHe has been named in the squad for the Europa League games against Fenerbahce and PAOK, as well as Premier League matches against Liverpool, Southampton, Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea.\\n\\nThe chance to work with van Nistelrooy again as well as getting more Premier League experience could be invaluable for the youngster as he looks to break into the United first team.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed

However, he stopped short of extending that promise until the [summer transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/summer-transfer-window), when he all but acknowledged the striker would leave Sporting.\\n\\nThere have been claims that United are in the market for a centre-forward in January. Amorim starting [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) over [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) against Ipswich Town only fuelled that speculation. Fresh reports now suggest someone United have previously shown interest in could be available.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n_[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/)_ claims Brighton and Hove Albion will make Evan Ferguson available on loan during January should their current striking department remain fit and firing. United academy graduate [Danny Welbeck](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/danny-welbeck) is starting ahead of the man 14 years his senior for the Seagulls this season, with Joao Pedro and Georginio Rutter supporting the striker.\\n\\nAll three appear ahead of the Republic of Ireland international in the mind of Brighton head coach Fabian Huerzeler despite Ferguson's desperation to play. They claim that a loan within the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) rather than the [Championship](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship) is the likeliest destination, with [Fulham](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc), [Leicester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc), [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [West Ham United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc) named as teams struggling in front of goal this season.\\n\\nUnited has not scored more than any of those quartets, and it is the club Ferguson was a boyhood fan of. [The Manchester Evening News reported last year](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-news-today-27696901) that the club were monitoring his progress on the south coast.\\n\\nNow, over 12 months on, Brighton is said to value their striker at around £60million, which is a fee unlikely to be affordable for United in the new year, but the Seagulls would prefer not to sell. Therefore, a loan move could suit both parties in the short term, with the Reds able to assess the availability of Gyokeres or others for the summer transfer window while reinforcing their frontline for the remainder of this season and presumably playing Ferguson plenty, at least more than Brighton currently are.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

However, he stopped short of extending that promise until the [summer transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/summer-transfer-window), when he all but acknowledged the striker would leave Sporting.\\n\\nThere have been claims that United are in the market for a centre-forward in January. Amorim starting [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) over [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) against Ipswich Town only fuelled that speculation. Fresh reports now suggest someone United have previously shown interest in could be available.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n_[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/)_ claims Brighton and Hove Albion will make Evan Ferguson available on loan during January should their current striking department remain fit and firing. United academy graduate [Danny Welbeck](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/danny-welbeck) is starting ahead of the man 14 years his senior for the Seagulls this season, with Joao Pedro and Georginio Rutter supporting the striker.\\n\\nAll three appear ahead of the Republic of Ireland international in the mind of Brighton head coach Fabian Huerzeler despite Ferguson's desperation to play. They claim that a loan within the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) rather than the [Championship](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship) is the likeliest destination, with [Fulham](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc), [Leicester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc), [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [West Ham United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc) named as teams struggling in front of goal this season.\\n\\nUnited has not scored more than any of those quartets, and it is the club Ferguson was a boyhood fan of. [The Manchester Evening News reported last year](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-news-today-27696901) that the club were monitoring his progress on the south coast.\\n\\nNow, over 12 months on, Brighton is said to value their striker at around £60million, which is a fee unlikely to be affordable for United in the new year, but the Seagulls would prefer not to sell. Therefore, a loan move could suit both parties in the short term, with the Reds able to assess the availability of Gyokeres or others for the summer transfer window while reinforcing their frontline for the remainder of this season and presumably playing Ferguson plenty, at least more than Brighton currently are.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Gary Neville spots Man United 'red flags' and issue

However, he stopped short of extending that promise until the [summer transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/summer-transfer-window), when he all but acknowledged the striker would leave Sporting.\\n\\nThere have been claims that United are in the market for a centre-forward in January. Amorim starting [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) over [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) against Ipswich Town only fuelled that speculation. Fresh reports now suggest someone United have previously shown interest in could be available.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n_[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/)_ claims Brighton and Hove Albion will make Evan Ferguson available on loan during January should their current striking department remain fit and firing. United academy graduate [Danny Welbeck](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/danny-welbeck) is starting ahead of the man 14 years his senior for the Seagulls this season, with Joao Pedro and Georginio Rutter supporting the striker.\\n\\nAll three appear ahead of the Republic of Ireland international in the mind of Brighton head coach Fabian Huerzeler despite Ferguson's desperation to play. They claim that a loan within the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) rather than the [Championship](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship) is the likeliest destination, with [Fulham](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc), [Leicester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc), [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [West Ham United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc) named as teams struggling in front of goal this season.\\n\\nUnited has not scored more than any of those quartets, and it is the club Ferguson was a boyhood fan of. [The Manchester Evening News reported last year](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-news-today-27696901) that the club were monitoring his progress on the south coast.\\n\\nNow, over 12 months on, Brighton is said to value their striker at around £60million, which is a fee unlikely to be affordable for United in the new year, but the Seagulls would prefer not to sell. Therefore, a loan move could suit both parties in the short term, with the Reds able to assess the availability of Gyokeres or others for the summer transfer window while reinforcing their frontline for the remainder of this season and presumably playing Ferguson plenty, at least more than Brighton currently are.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Gary Neville spots Man United 'red flags' and issue

Fresh reports now suggest someone United have previously shown interest in could be available.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n_[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/26/brighton-evan-ferguson-loan-january-transfer-window/)_ claims Brighton and Hove Albion will make Evan Ferguson available on loan during January should their current striking department remain fit and firing. United academy graduate [Danny Welbeck](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/danny-welbeck) is starting ahead of the man 14 years his senior for the Seagulls this season, with Joao Pedro and Georginio Rutter supporting the striker.\\n\\nAll three appear ahead of the Republic of Ireland international in the mind of Brighton head coach Fabian Huerzeler despite Ferguson's desperation to play. They claim that a loan within the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) rather than the [Championship](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship) is the likeliest destination, with [Fulham](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc), [Leicester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc), [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [West Ham United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc) named as teams struggling in front of goal this season.\\n\\nUnited has not scored more than any of those quartets, and it is the club Ferguson was a boyhood fan of. [The Manchester Evening News reported last year](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-news-today-27696901) that the club were monitoring his progress on the south coast.\\n\\nNow, over 12 months on, Brighton is said to value their striker at around £60million, which is a fee unlikely to be affordable for United in the new year, but the Seagulls would prefer not to sell. Therefore, a loan move could suit both parties in the short term, with the Reds able to assess the availability of Gyokeres or others for the summer transfer window while reinforcing their frontline for the remainder of this season and presumably playing Ferguson plenty, at least more than Brighton currently are.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Gary Neville spots Man United 'red flags' and issue

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\\n\\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\\n\\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\\n\\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\\n\\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://whttps/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallowwmanchestereveningnewscouk-all-about-amad-diallo) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes, would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\\n\\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\\n\\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\\n\\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name.\\\\]\\n\\nThough he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\\n\\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\\n\\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\\n\\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\\n\\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://whttps/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallowwmanchestereveningnewscouk-all-about-amad-diallo) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes, would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\\n\\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\\n\\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\\n\\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name.\\\\]\\n\\nThough he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim and Man United wildcard January transfer option as Viktor Gyokeres alternative

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\\n\\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\\n\\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\\n\\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\\n\\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://whttps/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallowwmanchestereveningnewscouk-all-about-amad-diallo) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes, would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\\n\\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\\n\\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\\n\\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name.\\\\]\\n\\nThough he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim and Man United wildcard January transfer option as Viktor Gyokeres alternative

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\\n\\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\\n\\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United considering including exciting youngsters in Europa League squad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-considering-including-exciting-30452024)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\\n\\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\\n\\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://whttps/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallowwmanchestereveningnewscouk-all-about-amad-diallo) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes, would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\\n\\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\\n\\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\\n\\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name.\\\\]\\n\\nThough he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim and Man United wildcard January transfer option as Viktor Gyokeres alternative

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\n\\nBefore [Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\\n\\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road. The United legend explained why Amorim will now have spotted some of the issues that need addressing.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"The red flags that were there yesterday would have been there probably for the last few months and the last season and a half of a team that are very difficult to actually like watching,\\\" Neville said on [Sky Sports' Monday Night Football](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29326/13260681/ruben-amorims-man-utd-bow-assessed-gary-neville-runs-though-the-winners-red-flags-and-familiar-failings-after-first-game).\\n\\n\\\"And I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game. No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\\n\\n\\\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\\n\\n\\\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\\n\\n\\\"He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\n\\nBefore [Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\\n\\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road. The United legend explained why Amorim will now have spotted some of the issues that need addressing.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"The red flags that were there yesterday would have been there probably for the last few months and the last season and a half of a team that are very difficult to actually like watching,\\\" Neville said on [Sky Sports' Monday Night Football](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29326/13260681/ruben-amorims-man-utd-bow-assessed-gary-neville-runs-though-the-winners-red-flags-and-familiar-failings-after-first-game).\\n\\n\\\"And I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game. No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\\n\\n\\\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\\n\\n\\\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\\n\\n\\\"He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\n\\nBefore [Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\\n\\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road. The United legend explained why Amorim will now have spotted some of the issues that need addressing.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"The red flags that were there yesterday would have been there probably for the last few months and the last season and a half of a team that are very difficult to actually like watching,\\\" Neville said on [Sky Sports' Monday Night Football](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29326/13260681/ruben-amorims-man-utd-bow-assessed-gary-neville-runs-though-the-winners-red-flags-and-familiar-failings-after-first-game).\\n\\n\\\"And I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game. No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\\n\\n\\\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\\n\\n\\\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\\n\\n\\\"He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\n\\nBefore [Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\\n\\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road. The United legend explained why Amorim will now have spotted some of the issues that need addressing.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"The red flags that were there yesterday would have been there probably for the last few months and the last season and a half of a team that are very difficult to actually like watching,\\\" Neville said on [Sky Sports' Monday Night Football](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29326/13260681/ruben-amorims-man-utd-bow-assessed-gary-neville-runs-though-the-winners-red-flags-and-familiar-failings-after-first-game).\\n\\n\\\"And I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game. No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\\n\\n\\\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\\n\\n\\\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\\n\\n\\\"He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\n\\nBefore [Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\\n\\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road.

No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\\n\\n\\\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\\n\\n\\\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\\n\\n\\\"He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Former [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [Stoke City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc) striker Joselu, who spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, scored a consolation for the hosts after the brace and a goal from the one-time [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) winger Angelo Gabriel.\\n\\nRonaldo shared a photo of himself and the latter doing his _Siu_ celebration during the match on the social media platform Musk owns, X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/twitter), afterwards. Eight minutes after posting, \\\"Big win tonight!\\\" Musk replied.\\n\\n\\\"Congrats!\\\" the businessman wrote, to which Ronaldo eventually responded approaching 20 hours later: \\\"@elonmusk … Glad your eyes have time for good “soccer”\\\"\\n\\nHe punctuated that response with a grinning face emoji and a flexed biceps emoji. The original post has over 68 million views, and Ronaldo has almost 114 million followers on the website, some 100 million less than Musk's 206 million.\\n\\nThe win comes three days after Al Nassr lost for the first time in the Saudi Pro League this season at home to Al Qadisiyah. Despite taking the lead through Ronaldo, the Mexico international Julian Quinones equalised before former [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc) captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored what proved to be the winning goal.\\n\\nAl Nassr has won just one of its last five domestic matches. They also drew with Al Hilal and Al Kholood and were knocked out of the King Cup of Champions by Al Taawoun.\\n\\nHowever, they have now qualified for the Champions League knockout stages with three games to spare.

Former [Newcastle United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc) and [Stoke City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stoke-city-fc) striker Joselu, who spent last season on loan at Real Madrid, scored a consolation for the hosts after the brace and a goal from the one-time [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) winger Angelo Gabriel.\\n\\nRonaldo shared a photo of himself and the latter doing his _Siu_ celebration during the match on the social media platform Musk owns, X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/twitter), afterwards. Eight minutes after posting, \\\"Big win tonight!\\\" Musk replied.\\n\\n\\\"Congrats!\\\" the businessman wrote, to which Ronaldo eventually responded approaching 20 hours later: \\\"@elonmusk … Glad your eyes have time for good “soccer”\\\"\\n\\n> [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) … Glad your eyes have time for good “soccer”\\n> \\n> — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) [November 26, 2024](https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1861444000638472559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nHe punctuated that response with a grinning face emoji and a flexed biceps emoji. The original post has over 68 million views, and Ronaldo has almost 114 million followers on the website, some 100 million less than Musk's 206 million.\\n\\nThe win comes three days after Al Nassr lost for the first time in the Saudi Pro League this season at home to Al Qadisiyah. Despite taking the lead through Ronaldo, the Mexico international Julian Quinones equalised before former [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc) captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored what proved to be the winning goal.\\n\\nAl Nassr has won just one of its last five domestic matches. They also drew with Al Hilal and Al Kholood and were knocked out of the King Cup of Champions by Al Taawoun.\\n\\nHowever, they have now qualified for the Champions League knockout stages with three games to spare.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), who included the likes of [Harry Amass](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-amass) and Ethan Wheatley in their starting line-up, were pegged back just before half-time when 18-year-old Yoel van den Ban clawed the home side level.\\n\\nThe Dutch outfit, who won the UEFA Youth League in 2022/23, turned the contest on its head with just over 20 minutes left when Kasper Boogaard found the net.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\nUnited boss Lawrence turned to his substitutes bench in the hope of finding an answer that would enable his side to find a route back into the game. He brought on striker Gabriele Biancheri, who has been scoring for fun so far this season, and Amir Ibragimov, but his efforts were to no avail, meaning United lost for just the second time this season in all competitions at Under-18s/Under-19s level.\\n\\nSummer signing Chido Obi-Martin was named in the matchday squad for a Youth League fixture for the first time this season but he failed to make it off the bench.\\n\\nUnited will get the chance to try and flip the tie on its head when the two sides meet again in the second leg at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on December 10. The winner of the tie will progress to the UEFA Youth League's full knockout stages, where the teams meet from the 'Domestic Champions path', in which United are currently competing in, and the 'UEFA

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), who included the likes of [Harry Amass](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-amass) and Ethan Wheatley in their starting line-up, were pegged back just before half-time when 18-year-old Yoel van den Ban clawed the home side level.\\n\\nThe Dutch outfit, who won the UEFA Youth League in 2022/23, turned the contest on its head with just over 20 minutes left when Kasper Boogaard found the net.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\nUnited boss Lawrence turned to his substitutes bench in the hope of finding an answer that would enable his side to find a route back into the game.

With [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\\n\\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['Be amazed' - Amorim has proven United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United can start their Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\nThere had been a lot of speculation about [Mazraoui's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\\n\\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\\n\\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\\n\\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\\\" he said. \\\"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles.

With [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\\n\\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['Be amazed' - Amorim has proven United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United can start their Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\nThere had been a lot of speculation about [Mazraoui's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\\n\\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\\n\\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\\n\\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\\\" he said. \\\"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three

With [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\\n\\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['Be amazed' - Amorim has proven United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United can start their Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\nThere had been a lot of speculation about [Mazraoui's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\\n\\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\\n\\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\\n\\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\\\" he said. \\\"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three

With [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\\n\\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['Be amazed' - Amorim has proven United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Manchester United can start their Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\nThere had been a lot of speculation about [Mazraoui's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\\n\\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\\n\\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\\n\\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\\\" he said. \\\"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three

The 19-year-old midfielder, who's yet to play for the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss, has [missed the last six matches due to a muscle injury](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660) he suffered last month.\\n\\nMainoo was replaced by Casemiro in the final minutes of the goalless draw with Aston Villa in October, having [aggravated the hamstring problem he picked up against Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/amad-mainoo-shaw-manchester-united-30328902) a week prior. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has since stepped down as interim manager, later confirmed that the teenager wouldn't be available until after the November international break.\\n\\n\\\"Kobbie is also progressing with his injury. He isn't yet with the team, though. He needs more time,\\\" said the Dutchman. Mainoo finally returned to the matchday squad that faced Ipswich Town at the weekend, but [he was an unused substitute](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-willing-hand-paul-30452417).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nRuben Amorim opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte instead, [further delaying the Englishman's audition for a place in the starting line-up](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/erik-ten-hags-manchester-united-30450414). In a column for [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1e71wvgp96o), former [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and England midfielder Danny Murphy claimed that the switch at Portman Road could be a sign of things to come, although Mainoo was returning from injury.\\n\\nThe ex-[Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) ace suggested that Mainoo may not have a future at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), and tipped Amorim to bring in a new face to partner Ugarte in the middle of the park. Murphy said: \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too.\\n\\n\\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n\\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\\"\\n\\nMurphy added: \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Murphy surprisingly overlooked Mainoo, [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) branded the teenager as a 'certainty' in Amorim's side. The United legend said: \\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they’re absolute certs.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The 19-year-old midfielder, who's yet to play for the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss, has [missed the last six matches due to a muscle injury](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660) he suffered last month.\\n\\nMainoo was replaced by Casemiro in the final minutes of the goalless draw with Aston Villa in October, having [aggravated the hamstring problem he picked up against Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/amad-mainoo-shaw-manchester-united-30328902) a week prior. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has since stepped down as interim manager, later confirmed that the teenager wouldn't be available until after the November international break.\\n\\n\\\"Kobbie is also progressing with his injury. He isn't yet with the team, though. He needs more time,\\\" said the Dutchman. Mainoo finally returned to the matchday squad that faced Ipswich Town at the weekend, but [he was an unused substitute](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-willing-hand-paul-30452417).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nRuben Amorim opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte instead, [further delaying the Englishman's audition for a place in the starting line-up](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/erik-ten-hags-manchester-united-30450414). In a column for [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1e71wvgp96o), former [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and England midfielder Danny Murphy claimed that the switch at Portman Road could be a sign of things to come, although Mainoo was returning from injury.\\n\\nThe ex-[Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) ace suggested that Mainoo may not have a future at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), and tipped Amorim to bring in a new face to partner Ugarte in the middle of the park. Murphy said: \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too.\\n\\n\\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n\\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\\"\\n\\nMurphy added: \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Murphy surprisingly overlooked Mainoo, [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) branded the teenager as a 'certainty' in Amorim's side. The United legend said: \\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they’re absolute certs.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The 19-year-old midfielder, who's yet to play for the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss, has [missed the last six matches due to a muscle injury](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660) he suffered last month.\\n\\nMainoo was replaced by Casemiro in the final minutes of the goalless draw with Aston Villa in October, having [aggravated the hamstring problem he picked up against Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/amad-mainoo-shaw-manchester-united-30328902) a week prior. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has since stepped down as interim manager, later confirmed that the teenager wouldn't be available until after the November international break.\\n\\n\\\"Kobbie is also progressing with his injury. He isn't yet with the team, though. He needs more time,\\\" said the Dutchman. Mainoo finally returned to the matchday squad that faced Ipswich Town at the weekend, but [he was an unused substitute](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-willing-hand-paul-30452417).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nRuben Amorim opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte instead, [further delaying the Englishman's audition for a place in the starting line-up](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/erik-ten-hags-manchester-united-30450414). In a column for [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1e71wvgp96o), former [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and England midfielder Danny Murphy claimed that the switch at Portman Road could be a sign of things to come, although Mainoo was returning from injury.\\n\\nThe ex-[Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) ace suggested that Mainoo may not have a future at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), and tipped Amorim to bring in a new face to partner Ugarte in the middle of the park. Murphy said: \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too.\\n\\n\\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n\\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\\"\\n\\nMurphy added: \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Murphy surprisingly overlooked Mainoo, [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) branded the teenager as a 'certainty' in Amorim's side. The United legend said: \\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they’re absolute certs.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The 19-year-old midfielder, who's yet to play for the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss, has [missed the last six matches due to a muscle injury](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660) he suffered last month.\\n\\nMainoo was replaced by Casemiro in the final minutes of the goalless draw with Aston Villa in October, having [aggravated the hamstring problem he picked up against Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/amad-mainoo-shaw-manchester-united-30328902) a week prior. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has since stepped down as interim manager, later confirmed that the teenager wouldn't be available until after the November international break.\\n\\n\\\"Kobbie is also progressing with his injury. He isn't yet with the team, though. He needs more time,\\\" said the Dutchman. Mainoo finally returned to the matchday squad that faced Ipswich Town at the weekend, but [he was an unused substitute](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-willing-hand-paul-30452417).\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nRuben Amorim opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte instead, [further delaying the Englishman's audition for a place in the starting line-up](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/erik-ten-hags-manchester-united-30450414). In a column for [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c1e71wvgp96o), former [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and England midfielder Danny Murphy claimed that the switch at Portman Road could be a sign of things to come, although Mainoo was returning from injury.\\n\\nThe ex-[Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) ace suggested that Mainoo may not have a future at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), and tipped Amorim to bring in a new face to partner Ugarte in the middle of the park. Murphy said: \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too.\\n\\n\\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n\\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\\"\\n\\nMurphy added: \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Murphy surprisingly overlooked Mainoo, [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) branded the teenager as a 'certainty' in Amorim's side. The United legend said: \\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they’re absolute certs.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\n\\\"It's then that three, which obviously the two that he likes to play sort of come inside a little bit. So, you're wondering about sort of Amad... Amad played obviously wide yesterday, but Garnacho, Rashford, \\\\[Rasmus\\\\] Hojlund, \\\\[Joshua\\\\] Zirkzee, Fernandes. That's the conundrum of those attacking positions where I can't quite see what's going to happen.\\n\\n\\\"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they're absolute certs. I think Luke Shaw's a certainty to play. I think he would be anyway in a back four or a back three.\\n\\n\\\"I think ultimately you'll end up with Yoro as the right-centre-back, I think just because of that energy and that pace. So, I think the winners will be the ones who I think are adaptable.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

United were light on centre-back options at Portman Road, missing Leny Yoro, [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) and Harry Maguire.\\n\\nAmorim, as expected, deployed a 3-4-3 formation, meaning he will need to be able to rely on his centre-backs to fill those three spaces in defence. And for [Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville), he believes Shaw and Yoro could be among the biggest winners of his appointment, likewise midfield duo Manuel Ugarte and [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), neither of whom started on Sunday.\\n\\n\\\"Luke Shaw, if he can keep fit \\\\[will be a winner\\\\],\\\" said Neville, speaking to Sky Sports. \\\"As I think that left centre-back needs to eventually be able to play out as a left-back, so he is well suited to do both. The same must be said of the right centre-back.\\n\\n\\\"We saw \\\\[Noussair\\\\] Mazraoui do it against Ipswich. I think Ugarte will be a winner, just because I think in midfield, not just because he's played for him before.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's how you fit in the likes of \\\\[Marcus\\\\] Rashford, \\\\[Alejandro\\\\] Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes. Because one thing you know with that system, you've got two wing-backs, you've got a back-three and you've got a two in front.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

Tomas Soucek opened the scoring after 10 minutes before the former United defender doubled the East London side's lead to alleviate some of the pressure building on under fire manager Julen Lopetegui.\\n\\nWest Ham moved six points clear of the bottom three and further away from the likes of Wolves - who picked up an important win away at Fulham - as well as Everton and Leicester City. Wan-Bissaka completed a move back to the capital, following a five-year spell at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), signing for West Ham on a seven-year contract for an undisclosed fee.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: ['I've never forgotten' - Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana shows his true colours](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660)**\\n\\nAnd after 11 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) outings, the 27-year-old scored his first goal for the Hammers and on Instagram, he wrote: \\\"First in claret & blue. We keep pushing.\\\"\\n\\nFormer United teammates Martial, De Gea and Teden Mengi were among those to send support to the full-back. Both Martial and De Gea posted spider emojis while the now-Luton Town defender Mengi added: \\\"Yessirrrrr.\\\"\\n\\nThere was also a compliment from former United coach Benni McCarthy. The former Blackburn Rovers striker, who left his role at the Theatre of Dreams in the summer, said: \\\"Nice one Wan B. Well played mate and good goal.\\\"\\n\\nErik ten Hag wanted to keep McCarthy in the United ranks following his one-year extension in light of the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) triumph over [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc). The South African opted to part ways and in an interview following his exit, while he praised the Dutchman highly, he noted that the tactician was lacking two key managerial components.\\n\\n\\\"Tactically Erik is one of the smartest coaches I have ever met. He is intelligent, a very intelligent man,\\\" he told Portuguese outlet [Zero Zero](https://www.zerozero.pt/noticias/benni-mccarthy-heroi-portista-separacao-entre-ronaldo-e-ten-hag-era-inevitavel-/682502#google_vignette). \\\"Meticulous, concerned with details.\\n\\n\\\"He made everything available to the players, he carefully explained every possible and imaginable situation about the game. Then, at the end of the day, it was up to the players to step onto the pitch and give a good response\\n\\n\\\"In modern football, I believe that players want to see a bit more passion in their coach. They need to feel that the coach is with them and willing to fight alongside them. Tactically, I feel that Erik is at the top. He lacks a bit of that fire, that passion. That’s where we differ, him and I.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes I didn’t see in him that passion I speak of. He has a different personality, a different profile. I think that was one of the difficulties that the team and the players encountered.\\\"\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

Tomas Soucek opened the scoring after 10 minutes before the former United defender doubled the East London side's lead to alleviate some of the pressure building on under fire manager Julen Lopetegui.\\n\\nWest Ham moved six points clear of the bottom three and further away from the likes of Wolves - who picked up an important win away at Fulham - as well as Everton and Leicester City. Wan-Bissaka completed a move back to the capital, following a five-year spell at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), signing for West Ham on a seven-year contract for an undisclosed fee.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: ['I've never forgotten' - Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana shows his true colours](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660)**\\n\\nAnd after 11 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) outings, the 27-year-old scored his first goal for the Hammers and on Instagram, he wrote: \\\"First in claret & blue. We keep pushing.\\\"\\n\\nFormer United teammates Martial, De Gea and Teden Mengi were among those to send support to the full-back. Both Martial and De Gea posted spider emojis while the now-Luton Town defender Mengi added: \\\"Yessirrrrr.\\\"\\n\\nThere was also a compliment from former United coach Benni McCarthy. The former Blackburn Rovers striker, who left his role at the Theatre of Dreams in the summer, said: \\\"Nice one Wan B. Well played mate and good goal.\\\"\\n\\nErik ten Hag wanted to keep McCarthy in the United ranks following his one-year extension in light of the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) triumph over [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc). The South African opted to part ways and in an interview following his exit, while he praised the Dutchman highly, he noted that the tactician was lacking two key managerial components.\\n\\n\\\"Tactically Erik is one of the smartest coaches I have ever met. He is intelligent, a very intelligent man,\\\" he told Portuguese outlet [Zero Zero](https://www.zerozero.pt/noticias/benni-mccarthy-heroi-portista-separacao-entre-ronaldo-e-ten-hag-era-inevitavel-/682502#google_vignette). \\\"Meticulous, concerned with details.\\n\\n\\\"He made everything available to the players, he carefully explained every possible and imaginable situation about the game. Then, at the end of the day, it was up to the players to step onto the pitch and give a good response\\n\\n\\\"In modern football, I believe that players want to see a bit more passion in their coach. They need to feel that the coach is with them and willing to fight alongside them. Tactically, I feel that Erik is at the top. He lacks a bit of that fire, that passion. That’s where we differ, him and I.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes I didn’t see in him that passion I speak of. He has a different personality, a different profile. I think that was one of the difficulties that the team and the players encountered.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Kobbie Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Ruben Amorim tipped to complete

Tomas Soucek opened the scoring after 10 minutes before the former United defender doubled the East London side's lead to alleviate some of the pressure building on under fire manager Julen Lopetegui.\\n\\nWest Ham moved six points clear of the bottom three and further away from the likes of Wolves - who picked up an important win away at Fulham - as well as Everton and Leicester City. Wan-Bissaka completed a move back to the capital, following a five-year spell at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), signing for West Ham on a seven-year contract for an undisclosed fee.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: ['I've never forgotten' - Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana shows his true colours](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660)**\\n\\nAnd after 11 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) outings, the 27-year-old scored his first goal for the Hammers and on Instagram, he wrote: \\\"First in claret & blue. We keep pushing.\\\"\\n\\nFormer United teammates Martial, De Gea and Teden Mengi were among those to send support to the full-back. Both Martial and De Gea posted spider emojis while the now-Luton Town defender Mengi added: \\\"Yessirrrrr.\\\"\\n\\nThere was also a compliment from former United coach Benni McCarthy. The former Blackburn Rovers striker, who left his role at the Theatre of Dreams in the summer, said: \\\"Nice one Wan B. Well played mate and good goal.\\\"\\n\\nErik ten Hag wanted to keep McCarthy in the United ranks following his one-year extension in light of the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) triumph over [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc). The South African opted to part ways and in an interview following his exit, while he praised the Dutchman highly, he noted that the tactician was lacking two key managerial components.\\n\\n\\\"Tactically Erik is one of the smartest coaches I have ever met. He is intelligent, a very intelligent man,\\\" he told Portuguese outlet [Zero Zero](https://www.zerozero.pt/noticias/benni-mccarthy-heroi-portista-separacao-entre-ronaldo-e-ten-hag-era-inevitavel-/682502#google_vignette). \\\"Meticulous, concerned with details.\\n\\n\\\"He made everything available to the players, he carefully explained every possible and imaginable situation about the game. Then, at the end of the day, it was up to the players to step onto the pitch and give a good response\\n\\n\\\"In modern football, I believe that players want to see a bit more passion in their coach. They need to feel that the coach is with them and willing to fight alongside them. Tactically, I feel that Erik is at the top. He lacks a bit of that fire, that passion. That’s where we differ, him and I.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes I didn’t see in him that passion I speak of. He has a different personality, a different profile. I think that was one of the difficulties that the team and the players encountered.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Kobbie Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Ruben Amorim tipped to complete

Tomas Soucek opened the scoring after 10 minutes before the former United defender doubled the East London side's lead to alleviate some of the pressure building on under fire manager Julen Lopetegui.\\n\\nWest Ham moved six points clear of the bottom three and further away from the likes of Wolves - who picked up an important win away at Fulham - as well as Everton and Leicester City. Wan-Bissaka completed a move back to the capital, following a five-year spell at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), signing for West Ham on a seven-year contract for an undisclosed fee.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: ['I've never forgotten' - Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana shows his true colours](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-never-forgotten-manchester-united-30451660)**\\n\\nAnd after 11 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) outings, the 27-year-old scored his first goal for the Hammers and on Instagram, he wrote: \\\"First in claret & blue. We keep pushing.\\\"\\n\\nFormer United teammates Martial, De Gea and Teden Mengi were among those to send support to the full-back. Both Martial and De Gea posted spider emojis while the now-Luton Town defender Mengi added: \\\"Yessirrrrr.\\\"\\n\\nThere was also a compliment from former United coach Benni McCarthy. The former Blackburn Rovers striker, who left his role at the Theatre of Dreams in the summer, said: \\\"Nice one Wan B. Well played mate and good goal.\\\"\\n\\nErik ten Hag wanted to keep McCarthy in the United ranks following his one-year extension in light of the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) triumph over [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc). The South African opted to part ways and in an interview following his exit, while he praised the Dutchman highly, he noted that the tactician was lacking two key managerial components.\\n\\n\\\"Tactically Erik is one of the smartest coaches I have ever met. He is intelligent, a very intelligent man,\\\" he told Portuguese outlet [Zero Zero](https://www.zerozero.pt/noticias/benni-mccarthy-heroi-portista-separacao-entre-ronaldo-e-ten-hag-era-inevitavel-/682502#google_vignette). \\\"Meticulous, concerned with details.\\n\\n\\\"He made everything available to the players, he carefully explained every possible and imaginable situation about the game. Then, at the end of the day, it was up to the players to step onto the pitch and give a good response\\n\\n\\\"In modern football, I believe that players want to see a bit more passion in their coach. They need to feel that the coach is with them and willing to fight alongside them. Tactically, I feel that Erik is at the top. He lacks a bit of that fire, that passion. That’s where we differ, him and I.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes I didn’t see in him that passion I speak of. He has a different personality, a different profile. I think that was one of the difficulties that the team and the players encountered.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Kobbie Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Ruben Amorim tipped to complete

They will have to learn very quickly but I think as well, they need to just write off this season.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a long time \\\\[of pain\\\\] for [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and they are going to have to accept that as they have got the man they want now.

after officially joining from Portuguese club

Town](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/ruben-amorim-man-united-ipswich-741509-20241125), a result which indicates the size of the task Amorim faces in transforming the club's fortunes this season.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nThe Red Devils are currently 12th in the Premier League, already 15 points behind league leaders Liverpool after just 12 games.\\n\\nAmorim's predecessor Erik ten Hag spent more than £600m on new signings during his time as manager at United, leaving the Portuguese with a restricted transfer budget in January.\\n\\nBut that hasn't stopped the club targeting potential signings for the Portuguese.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nNow, a sensational report in Italy claims United are lining up a move for [Napoli](https://www.sportbible.com/napoli) winger [Khvicha Kvaratskhelia](https://www.sportbible.com/khvicha-kvaratskhelia).\\n\\nItalian outlet [Sportmediaset](https://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2024/manchester-united-serious-in-move-for-napolis-khvicha-kvaratskhelia/?utm_content=cmp-true) \\\\[via

'serious' move for the Georgia international, who has scored 30 goals and provided 28 assists in 103 games for Napoli.\\n\\nAmorim is said to view him as a 'key target' for the inside forward role in his preferred 3-4-3 set-up.\\n\\nKvaratskhelia is out of contract in 2027 and Napoli are keen to tie him down to a new long-term deal.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nThe Serie A leaders are said to have offered him a €6m (£5.1m) contract to convince him to stay.\\n\\nHowever, United are prepared to offer the player a €9m (£7.5m) deal, which Napoli would be unable to match.\\n\\nThe report adds that if Kvaratskhelia's future isn't resolved by the end of the season, Napoli could look to sell the winger – but a fee of around €100m (£83.4m) would be required to convince the Italian club to part ways.\\n\\n![Image 1: United are said to have 'serious' interest in Kvaratskhelia (Image:

are said to have 'serious' interest in Kvaratskhelia (Image: Getty)\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nKvaratskhelia has scored five goals in 15 games this season to help Napoli to the top of Serie A, where they are one point clear of four teams – Atalanta, Inter, Fiorentina and Lazio.\\n\\nSpeaking last year, Kvaratskhelia's former Napoli teammate Victor Osimhen tipped the Georgian to challenge for the Ballon d'Or in the coming seasons.\\n\\n\\\"He's a great guy, I understood that immediately,\\\" said Osimhen.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone loves him in the dressing room, not only for what he does on the pitch but also for what he does off the pitch.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"I believe he can win the Ballon d'Or in the next few years, I hope he also brings many successes to Napoli.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2: comment

[Jamie Redknapp](https://www.sportbible.com/jamie-redknapp), meanwhile, was heard telling the group to \\\"just leave it\\\".\\n\\nNow, season ticket holder Neil Finbow, 55, has given a further insight into the row after standing right next to the former Manchester United captain as the incident played out.\\n\\n\\\"It was the guy in the middle's comments that got him, I think,\\\" Finbow told [**The Mirror**](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ipswich-fan-roy-keane-manutd-34181330). \\\"He was going on about his time when he was manager, how he treated his kids.\\\"\\n\\nFinbow continued: \\\"I will sort of defend [Roy Keane](https://www.sportbible.com/roy-keane) here as well, because it may be that the comment 'I'll see you in the car park' is to talk to the guy rather than take him out, so it can be misconstrued. I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"The guy had an issue, when \\\\[Keane\\\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that. So obviously that's been pent-up.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"I don't have any regrets \\\\[about going down the front\\\\]. It's pent-up anger. No swear words came out of my mouth, I just said 'you're a better pundit than you are a manager'.\\\"\\n\\nSky Sports will reportedly investigate the incident to see if any action is needed, while Finbow admits he is concerned about the future of his season ticket.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone I sit with knows what I'm like,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm in the family bit there, I've been there for years. I do worry about my season ticket, someone has put on there that it could affect it, but I don't think I've been abusive or anything. If people class that as abuse then it's just gone mad.\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 1: Roy Keane clashed with an Ipswich supporter.

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\\n\\n\\\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\\n\\n\\\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 1: Image credit: Sky Sports/X](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0542222d6dee7723/67458635803d5c87b49cea3c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_08.11.18.png)\\n\\nImage credit: Sky Sports/X\\n\\nHe added: \\\"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\\n\\n\\\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim added: \\\"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 3: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Ten talking points from the weekend football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ipswich Town](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswichtown)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Southampton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton)\\n*   [Arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal)\\n*   [features](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=PremierLeague:10talkingpointsfromtheweekend%E2%80%99saction&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2024%2Fnov%2F25%2Fpremier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action&type=article&internalpagecode=football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nComments (…)\\n------------\\n\\n[Sign in](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dsignin_to_comment) or [create your Guardian account](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dregister_to_comment) to join the discussion\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-11-25T08:00:36.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":4379}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\",\"description\":\"Amad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\",\"content\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n=============== \\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)\\n\\n![Image 2: Dejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840cfe382b44d072bebc725833788993c800c480/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\nDejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri.

He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 3: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Can this Ruben Amorim fella walk the walk as well as he talks the talk?  \n\nSuch a drastic change of vision would have been challenging to instil with a full pre-season at his disposal. United visited Portman Road with two training sessions in the tank.  \n\nAmorim understands that only wins will buy him time, but that has not deterred his repeated cries for patience.  \n\nIt was simple. The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.  \n\nThis time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.  \n\nAmorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.  \n\n**BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions.**  \n\n**Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \"suffer\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\n\nRuben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity. We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n**Published Time:** 2024-11-25T14:26:00Z  \n**Article Date:** 2024-11-25\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\n\nManchester United have shared their first quarter financial results, confirming total revenue up to September 30 was £143.1million, including a profit of £1.3m compared to a £32.8m loss during the same period last year.\n\nUnited have confirmed they have encountered a reduction in commercial revenue as a result of having a smaller scale pre-season tour. United, for the second year running, visited the United States, but played just three friendlies, facing Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool. They played five friendlies in total in comparison to they eight they fulfilled ahead of 2023/24.\n\nAs a result, their commercial revenue for the first quarter was £85.3m - a reduction of 5.6 per cent from the first quarter in 2023.\n\nThe club has also announced a loss in broadcast revenue in comparison to the first quarter last year, with revenue from the new-look Europa League format earning United £31.3m from the first quarter.\n\nUnited, of course, participated in the Champions League last season and the financial rewards for competing in Europe's premier club competition are more lucrative. United secured £39.3m from broadcast revenue in the first quarter last season, highlighting a 20.4 per cent reduction.\n\nThe matchday revenue earned from the first quarter has stronger parallels with the figure earned from the first quarter 12 months ago, with United earning £26.5m. They banked £27.4m last year, marking a reduction of just 3.3 per cent.\n\nTotal revenue from the first quarter stands at £141.3m in comparison to a figure of £157.1m in 2023.\n\nUnited chief executive Omar Berrada said: \"The season is now well underway for both our men's and women's team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible.\n\n\"We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men's team and remain committed to returning Manchester United to the top of domestic and European football. Our cost and headcount reductions remain on track, and we are pleased to have seen further commercial traction, and welcome new partner Heineken, through their Tiger brand. Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work.\n\n\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\"\n\nUnited have confirmed that nothing within the figures relates to any events beyond September 30, meaning the cost of Erik ten Hag's dismissal on October 28 has not been included within the first quarter, likewise the release clause paid to Sporting Lisbon for Amorim.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

[Sources indicated earlier this year that the task force hoped to conclude their findings by the end of 2024](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-reveal-very-positive-29600940).\n\n**READ MORE:** **[United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\n\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\n\nUnited have consulted supporters during the process and earlier this month [shared the results of a survey they distributed to season ticket holders, United members and executive club members](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/world-class-manchester-united-reveal-30299695). Fifty-two per cent of those who participated said they are in favour of a new stadium being constructed.\n\nIssuing a fresh update on the landscape of the situation, Berrada has confirmed the task force is still conducting its investigation and it will not be until that is complete that United will then consider their plans.\n\n\"Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work,\" said Berrada.\n\n\"Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.\"\n\nIn March, Ratcliffe outlined his preference to build a new stadium, saying the club had the 'opportunity' to build a new arena that could house up to 100,000 supporters.\n\n\"It needs to have a stadium that's befitting the club and the brand,\" Ratcliffe told the [Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jp0G27S1yAe5FkBQqYkaC?si=95822aaf6ff14fc3&nd=1&dlsi=d33da2679a144d8c). \"That might have been the case 20 years ago, but it isn't today.\n\n\"I mean we can refurbish the ground and we'll do a really nice job of that, it will be a fantastic stadium. And that would cost about a billion \\[pounds\\] to do that and the club can shoulder that burden.\n\n\"But you have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground because we have got enough space to build a completely new ground. If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state of the art, world-class, 90,000 or maybe even 100,000 (capacity).\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\n\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\n\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\n\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\n\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\n\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\n\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\n\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\n\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\n\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\n\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\n\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\n\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would he be given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\n\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\n\n\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\" said Amass in the summer.\n\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\n\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th Premier League start and not his first.\n\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of United's 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\n\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make Ruben Amorim's first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount. \n\nOf that midfield trio, Mainoo was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.  \n\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\n\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and Amad in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\n\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\n\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\n\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on Monday Night Football, where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\n\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\n\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\n\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\n\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\n\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\n\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\n\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n### Arsenal send clear Ruben Amorim message\n\nManchester United may well have appointed the next big thing in management judging by how Sporting CP's first Champions League game without Ruben Amorim played out.\n\nIn his last home clash, the Portuguese champions beat Manchester City 4-1. However, just a few weeks later they were on the end of a battering by an English team. Arsenal rocked up to Jose Alvalade Stadium following a comfortable 3-0 victory against Nottingham Forest and again showed their attacking power.\n\nAt half time, it was 3-0 to the Gunners with the final score being 5-1, though it could have been much more. While Sporting were missing key players, it is telling how they got on without Amorim at the helm against elite-level opposition.\n\nAs such, it seems clear that Amorim is a very talented coach and given time will be able to bring success back to Old Trafford.\n\n### Strongest United line-up with Ferguson\n\nManchester United may have been handed a major boost ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nUnited have been linked with several potential new signings in recent months, with one of them being Brighton striker Evan Ferguson. It was reported by the Daily Star in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\n\nAnd now, after a tough start to the season, The Telegraph has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season.\n\n### Gyokeres opening 45 minutes vs Arsenal\n\nThat was a very difficult first half for Viktor Gyokeres and Sporting CP with Arsenal ahead courtesy of goals from Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhaes.\n\nIn his last European outing, which was Ruben Amorim's final home game before joining Manchester United, the Swede bagged a hat-trick against Manchester City but barely touched the ball in the opening 45 against the Gunners.\n\nHe did have some nice touches and his strong hold up play was on show but Gabriel and William Saliba mostly dealt with his threat.\n\n### Van Nistelrooy could provide United with transfer boost\n\nThere has been a lot of talk over the future of Ruud van Nistelrooy since his Manchester United exit just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe former striker returned to United in the summer as assistant to Erik ten Hag. The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\n\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\n\nHe has now been heavily linked with the Leicester City job.\n\n### Ruben Amorim identifies key transfer target\n\nManchester United are reportedly interested in Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window, with the player in a contract stand-off with his current club.\n\nNapoli are keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached.\n\n### Neville spots Man United 'red flags'\n\nGary Neville has explained why Ruben Amorim will be fully aware of the 'red flags' at Manchester United.\n\nAmorim's reign as United head coach began on Sunday with a 1-1 draw away at Ipswich Town. The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the Premier League table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nBefore Amorim's appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the league table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\n\n**[Read more here](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gary-neville-spots-man-united-30457486).**\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The youngster needed an arm placed around him as he returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off but subsequently delivered a strong performance.\n\nAmass is probably more frustrated than he shows. The youngster played a prominent role in pre-season on the United States tour but hasn't been given his debut this season.\n\nWithout stating the obvious, making a debut for United is a landmark moment in a player's career and they aren't handed out willy-nilly, but Amass seemed likely to make his.\n\nAmass excelled during the United States pre-season tour and travelled to Wembley for the Community Shield. Many expected him to make his debut against Manchester City in that game but he was left out of the squad and only had the opportunity to be around the team instead.\n\nThe 17-year-old was included in six matchday squads in the Premier League at the back end of last season. With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\n\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\n\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\n\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\n\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\n\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\n\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\n\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\n\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would he be given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\n\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\n\n\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\" said Amass in the summer.\n\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

With a promising pre-season under his belt and Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia still sidelined at the beginning of the new campaign, he seemed a prime candidate to make a debut in 2024/25.\n\nHowever, Amass has been overlooked and the longer his wait for a debut goes on, it feels likelier it might not happen and there have been reports of Aston Villa being interested.\n\nConsidering Shaw and Malacia were unavailable, Amass would have seen the start of the season as the perfect chance to make his debut but he's continued to play for the U21s.\n\nHe was on the bench against West Ham and Chelsea in the Premier League, in the squads to face Fenerbahce and PAOK in the Europa League and was included in the squad to face Leicester in the Carabao Cup, but hasn't come close to getting onto the pitch to make his debut.\n\nSomething that could have irked Amass was when Toby Collyer started at left-back against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup and he was left out the squad - that might have dented his belief.\n\nAmass watched from home as a midfielder played in his position and that seemed bizarre as former manager Erik ten Hag clearly rated him throughout the pre-season schedule.\n\nUnited's youngsters have travelled to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar and Amass is set to start in that game, meaning he won't be involved with the senior squad on Thursday.\n\nMalacia is finally available and was on the bench against Ipswich, while Shaw made his first appearance in nine months and there is stiff competition at left-back again.\n\nIt's obvious what Amass will be thinking: why would he be given a first-team debut now if he wasn't when the two senior left-backs were injured? It's not been a surprise to see reports linking Amass with a move away emerge but that doesn't mean his Old Trafford dream is over.\n\nAmass can either knuckle down, continue to work hard and attempt to make his debut with United, or decide that a move away to another club would be better for his long-term career.\n\n\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career,\" said Amass in the summer.\n\nThe London-born lad signed his first professional contract with the club in March when he celebrated his 17th birthday and it will be fascinating to see how the situation develops.",

It was reported by the Daily Star in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\n\nUnited were reportedly considering a £50million bid to sign Ferguson, who scored six goals in 36 appearances last season. Brighton were reported to value Ferguson at £60million at the time, but now their stance has seemingly changed.\n\nThe Telegraph has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season. After valuing the 20-year-old at £60million just three months ago, it seems that the Seagulls want to give Ferguson more playing time after giving him just nine appearances with three starts under new manager Fabian Hurzeler.\n\nUnited have been heavily linked with signing a striker in recent months, and the update on Ferguson's future could be the perfect opportunity for the club to strengthen a key position. However, the signing of Ferguson could present questions for two members of the United squad.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund are United's current centre forward options, but have scored just three goals between them this season. Zirkzee was signed by United last summer from Bologna in a deal worth up to €42.5million (£35.5million).\n\nShould United sign Ferguson, then it would leave United with a decision to make regarding the futures of Zirkzee and Hojlund. In Zirkzee's case, the striker has been linked with a loan move away from Old Trafford when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.\n\nFerguson would perform in a centre-forward role for United, likely with two wide forwards on either wing. They could be Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo or Antony, who are all options to play in the forward areas.\n\n**Potential United line-up after Evan Ferguson signing:** Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Yoro, Martinez, Shaw; Mainoo, Ugarte; Fernandes, Ferguson, Garnacho.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

However, he stopped short of extending that promise until the summer transfer window, when he all but acknowledged the striker would leave Sporting.\n\nThere have been claims that United are in the market for a centre-forward in January. Amorim starting Marcus Rashford over Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee against Ipswich Town only fuelled that speculation. Fresh reports now suggest someone United have previously shown interest in could be available.\n\nThe Telegraph claims Brighton and Hove Albion will make Evan Ferguson available on loan during January should their current striking department remain fit and firing. United academy graduate Danny Welbeck is starting ahead of the man 14 years his senior for the Seagulls this season, with Joao Pedro and Georginio Rutter supporting the striker.\n\nAll three appear ahead of the Republic of Ireland international in the mind of Brighton head coach Fabian Huerzeler despite Ferguson's desperation to play. They claim that a loan within the Premier League rather than the Championship is the likeliest destination, with Fulham, Leicester City, Newcastle United and West Ham United named as teams struggling in front of goal this season.\n\nUnited has not scored more than any of those quartets, and it is the club Ferguson was a boyhood fan of. The Manchester Evening News reported last year that the club were monitoring his progress on the south coast.\n\nNow, over 12 months on, Brighton is said to value their striker at around £60million, which is a fee unlikely to be affordable for United in the new year, but the Seagulls would prefer not to sell. Therefore, a loan move could suit both parties in the short term, with the Reds able to assess the availability of Gyokeres or others for the summer transfer window while reinforcing their frontline for the remainder of this season and presumably playing Ferguson plenty, at least more than Brighton currently are.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\n\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\n\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\n\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\n\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\n\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallow) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\n\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\n\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\n\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name. Though he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the Premier League table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nBefore Amorim's appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the Premier League table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\n\nNeville was asked if he spotted any concerns with individual performances from some United players at Portman Road. The United legend explained why Amorim will now have spotted some of the issues that need addressing.\n\n\"The red flags that were there yesterday would have been there probably for the last few months and the last season and a half of a team that are very difficult to actually like watching,\" Neville said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football.\n\n\"And I say that with respect because I genuinely do believe what Ruben Amorim said at the end of the game. No football player goes out onto the pitch and wants to lose or doesn't want to win or, work hard or do well.\n\n\"They don't want criticism. But you watch them play, even yesterday, the new system, and you look at Ipswich, who are very near the bottom of the league, who look more organized, better coached. They look like they've got more appetite for the game, more enthusiasm.\n\n\"And that's a constant and has been a constant, not just obviously on Sunday, but a constant for the last year-and-a-half, two years, three years. So we got to a situation where these group of players, to be honest with you, have created a pattern for themselves and become what they are.\n\n\"And not just a red flag yesterday, because the same things that we've seen in the last six to eight months, ten months, we saw yesterday with Ruben Amorim being the manager, he saw it as well.\n\n\"He [Amorim] obviously knew how big a job this was, but he'll have recognized it yesterday.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\n\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th Premier League start and not his first.\n\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of United's 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\n\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make Ruben Amorim's first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount. \n\nOf that midfield trio, Mainoo was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.  \n\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\n\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and Amad in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\n\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\n\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\n\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on Monday Night Football, where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\n\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\n\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\n\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\n\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\n\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\n\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\n\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

With United still yet to field a natural left-back this season, Mazraoui has had to fill in on both flanks, with 12 of his appearances at right-back and three on the left.\n\nThere was widespread surprise when Erik ten Hag fielded him as an attacking midfielder at Fenerbahce in the Europa League, an experiment unlikely to be repeated under Amorim, even if he does like to operate with two players in that area of the pitch. That didn't stop the Portuguese from giving him a new position though, starting him as the right-sided central defender in his 3-4-3 system at Ipswich.\n\nThere had been a lot of speculation about Mazraoui's potential role under Amorim and whether he had the attributes to play at wing-back. In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\n\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\n\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\n\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\n\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\" he said. \"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 19-year-old midfielder, who's yet to play for the new Manchester United boss, has missed the last six matches due to a muscle injury he suffered last month.\n\nMainoo was replaced by Casemiro in the final minutes of the goalless draw with Aston Villa in October, having aggravated the hamstring problem he picked up against Tottenham Hotspur a week prior. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has since stepped down as interim manager, later confirmed that the teenager wouldn't be available until after the November international break.\n\n\"Kobbie is also progressing with his injury. He isn't yet with the team, though. He needs more time,\" said the Dutchman. Mainoo finally returned to the matchday squad that faced Ipswich Town at the weekend, but he was an unused substitute.\n\nRuben Amorim opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte instead, further delaying the Englishman's audition for a place in the starting line-up. In a column for BBC Sport, former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy claimed that the switch at Portman Road could be a sign of things to come, although Mainoo was returning from injury.\n\nThe ex-Premier League ace suggested that Mainoo may not have a future at Old Trafford, and tipped Amorim to bring in a new face to partner Ugarte in the middle of the park. Murphy said: \"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too.\n\n\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them. He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\"\n\nMurphy added: \"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\"\n\nWhile Murphy surprisingly overlooked Mainoo, Gary Neville branded the teenager as a 'certainty' in Amorim's side. The United legend said: \"I think Mainoo and Ugarte for me, playing midfield, I think they’re absolute certs.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n### Arsenal send clear Ruben Amorim message\n\nManchester United may well have appointed the next big thing in management judging by how Sporting CP's first Champions League game without Ruben Amorim played out.\n\nIn his last home clash, the Portuguese champions beat Manchester City 4-1. However, just a few weeks later they were on the end of a battering by an English team. Arsenal rocked up to Jose Alvalade Stadium following a comfortable 3-0 victory against Nottingham Forest and again showed their attacking power.\n\nAt half time, it was 3-0 to the Gunners with the final score being 5-1, though it could have been much more. While Sporting were missing key players, it is telling how they got on without Amorim at the helm against elite-level opposition.\n\nAs such, it seems clear that Amorim is a very talented coach and given time will be able to bring success back to Old Trafford.\n\n### Strongest United line-up with Ferguson\n\nManchester United may have been handed a major boost ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nUnited have been linked with several potential new signings in recent months, with one of them being Brighton striker Evan Ferguson. It was reported by the Daily Star in August that United were weighing up a move to sign the Republic of Ireland international but would face competition from Chelsea.\n\nAnd now, after a tough start to the season, The Telegraph has reported that Brighton are willing to let Ferguson leave the Amex Stadium in January on loan for the remainder of the season.\n\n### Gyokeres opening 45 minutes vs Arsenal\n\nThat was a very difficult first half for Viktor Gyokeres and Sporting CP with Arsenal ahead courtesy of goals from Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhaes.\n\nIn his last European outing, which was Ruben Amorim's final home game before joining Manchester United, the Swede bagged a hat-trick against Manchester City but barely touched the ball in the opening 45 against the Gunners.\n\nHe did have some nice touches and his strong hold up play was on show but Gabriel and William Saliba mostly dealt with his threat.\n\n### Van Nistelrooy could provide United with transfer boost\n\nThere has been a lot of talk over the future of Ruud van Nistelrooy since his Manchester United exit just a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe former striker returned to United in the summer as assistant to Erik ten Hag. The manager’s sacking in October led to van Nistelrooy taking interim charge of the club.\n\nIn his four games in charge, United won three and drew one. Two of those wins came against Leicester City - a 5-2 Carabao Cup victory and a 3-0 win in the Premier League.\n\nHe has now been heavily linked with the Leicester City job.\n\n### Ruben Amorim identifies key transfer target\n\nManchester United are reportedly interested in Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window, with the player in a contract stand-off with his current club.\n\nNapoli are keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached.\n\n### Neville spots Man United 'red flags'\n\nGary Neville has explained why Ruben Amorim will be fully aware of the 'red flags' at Manchester United.\n\nAmorim's reign as United head coach began on Sunday with a 1-1 draw away at Ipswich Town. The stalemate leaves United in 12th place in the Premier League table and will next face Everton in the top flight after taking on Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League.\n\nBefore Amorim's appointment, United had won just three of their first 10 Premier League matches this season, as well as four defeats. The draw with Ipswich still leaves United in the bottom half of the league table but just six points adrift of the top four spots.\n\n**[Read more here](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gary-neville-spots-man-united-30457486).**\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Tomas Soucek opened the scoring after 10 minutes before the former United defender doubled the East London side's lead to alleviate some of the pressure building on under-fire manager Julen Lopetegui.\n\nWest Ham moved six points clear of the bottom three and further away from the likes of Wolves - who picked up an important win away at Fulham - as well as Everton and Leicester City. Wan-Bissaka completed a move back to the capital, following a five-year spell at Old Trafford, signing for West Ham on a seven-year contract for an undisclosed fee.\n\nAnd after 11 Premier League outings, the 27-year-old scored his first goal for the Hammers and on Instagram, he wrote: \"First in claret & blue. We keep pushing.\"\n\nFormer United teammates Martial, De Gea and Teden Mengi were among those to send support to the full-back. Both Martial and De Gea posted spider emojis while the now-Luton Town defender Mengi added: \"Yessirrrrr.\"\n\nThere was also a compliment from former United coach Benni McCarthy. The former Blackburn Rovers striker, who left his role at the Theatre of Dreams in the summer, said: \"Nice one Wan B. Well played mate and good goal.\"\n\nErik ten Hag wanted to keep McCarthy in the United ranks following his one-year extension in light of the FA Cup triumph over Manchester City. The South African opted to part ways and in an interview following his exit, while he praised the Dutchman highly, he noted that the tactician was lacking two key managerial components.\n\n\"Tactically Erik is one of the smartest coaches I have ever met. He is intelligent, a very intelligent man,\" he told Portuguese outlet Zero Zero. \"Meticulous, concerned with details.\n\n\"He made everything available to the players, he carefully explained every possible and imaginable situation about the game. Then, at the end of the day, it was up to the players to step onto the pitch and give a good response\n\n\"In modern football, I believe that players want to see a bit more passion in their coach. They need to feel that the coach is with them and willing to fight alongside them. Tactically, I feel that Erik is at the top. He lacks a bit of that fire, that passion. That’s where we differ, him and I.\n\n\"Sometimes I didn’t see in him that passion I speak of. He has a different personality, a different profile. I think that was one of the difficulties that the team and the players encountered.\"\n\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Gomes was highly rated throughout his time in the [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) youth set-up, going on to make 10 senior appearances before departing the club in 2020 after failing to agree terms over a new deal.\n\nSince then, [his ascent has been remarkable.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving [Old Trafford,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\n\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him [linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-clear-angel-gomes-30440973) The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\n\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year [with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-mourinho-gomes-amorim-30439244)\n\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\n\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played [Amad Diallo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallow) in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\n\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\n\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\n\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name. Though he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

It's worth throwing in the caveat that had he not experienced the level of first-team football he has since leaving Old Trafford, he might not have gone on to become a fully fledged England international.\n\nGomes' performances with the Three Lions have been impressive and it should come as no surprise to see him linked with not just United, but a number of other Premier League clubs. The former Reds youngster was predominantly a number ten during his time at Carrington, but was utilised by Lee Carsley in a deep-lying midfield role on international duty.\n\nAlso capable of playing on the wing, Gomes would add some much needed versatility to United's current squad, if they were to enter negotiations in January. Ruben Amorim's side would be able to hold talks over a reunion for the 24-year-old at the turn of the year with his contract set to expire with his current club this summer.\n\nLille could be tempted to cash in on the midfielder who has one goal and one assist to his name so far this season, before potentially losing him on a free transfer at the end of the campaign. A free transfer would be a huge boost for United and their battle to pass the Premier League's PSR deadline, while also allowing them to invest into other areas of the squad.\n\nDuring the recent draw with Ipswich, Amorim played Amad Diallo in an unorthodox wing-back role. United have had their fair share of injuries in recent weeks, so bolstering the squad with a player like Gomes would allow Diallo to be utilised further forward.\n\nAfter all, Gomes has played in a deeper role for England and with his current club, arguably having more defensive awareness than Amad who operates better in the final third. That's not taking anything away from the Ivorian who has been one of the bright sparks from an otherwise disappointing campaign to date for United.\n\nGomes is a signing that makes perfect sense. It would allow Amorim to utilise his preferred 3-4-3 formation which we saw for the first time at Portman Road.\n\nThe England international could also add some much needed creativity to the final third, if he were to be utilised as one of the number tens behind the central striker. Gomes finished last season with ten assists in all competitions for Lille and two goals to his name. Though he's not the most clinical in front of goal, the young Englishman is a creator and that's something United are crying out for at present time.",

Must run in the family.\"\n\nAlthough the young midfielder is likely years away from making any senior appearances for Arsenal, he will no doubt aim to follow in the footsteps of his older brother after he established himself as a fan-favourite last weekend.\n\nSpeaking about Nwaneri's performance last Saturday, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta [told the BBC's Match of the Day](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cr7rnmy190lt): \"He is the second youngest \\[Premier League goalscorer\\] in our history. That is a story in itself.\n\n\"He is brave. You see the reaction of fans, and they were singing 'he is one of our own'.\n\n\"I think we have to put brick-by-brick and make sure the cement does not get dry. Hopefully, we can build a beautiful thing with him.\"\n\nIn total, the midfielder has made nine appearances across all competitions this season, having made his senior debut for Arsenal last season.\n\nHis goal against Forest was his fourth for the London club this season, having scored one against Preston North End and two against Bolton Wanderers during the Carabao Cup campaign.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

In the end, Diogo Dalot and Amad started. But with Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire all absent, there was a role for Mazraoui.\n\nThe 27-year-old impressed again and further solidified his reputation as a fan favourite. It was only his fifth career start at centre-back, but he defended superbly and was comfortable on the ball. He played a role in the build-up to the first goal by taking possession from Andre Onana and then finding a pass up the right flank that allowed Bruno Fernandes and Amad to combine.\n\nOnce again, it was his physicality that most caught the eye. He won 11 duels in the game, the most by an individual in the Premier League this season and six more than any of his United teammates. He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\n\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\n\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\" he said. \"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

He loves a battle and often comes out on top, so while Liam Delap tried to bully United's defence, he didn't get much success against Mazraoui.\n\nWith Yoro closing in on a return and Martinez and Maguire not far away, Mazraoui's stint as a centre-back could be a short one. Amorim's best back three will surely be Yoro, Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nBut the new head coach might have to find a role for Mazraoui somewhere. He has already complained about this squad's lack of running back and physicality. Mazraoui's relish of the battle and his own physical strengths could make him important as something of a tone-setter.\n\nAmorim was certainly impressed with him at Ipswich. “We don’t have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well,\" he said. \"He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\" \n\nMazraoui could soon be operating in a fifth position this season if he gets a chance in one of the wing-back roles. He is close to undroppable at the moment because of the influence he can have on his teammates.",

Must run in the family.\"\n\nAlthough the young midfielder is likely years away from making any senior appearances for Arsenal, he will no doubt aim to follow in the footsteps of his older brother after he established himself as a fan-favourite last weekend.\n\nSpeaking about Nwaneri's performance last Saturday, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta [told the BBC's Match of the Day](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cr7rnmy190lt): \"He is the second youngest \\[Premier League goalscorer\\] in our history.

Must run in the family.\"\n\nAlthough the young midfielder is likely years away from making any senior appearances for Arsenal, he will no doubt aim to follow in the footsteps of his older brother after he established himself as a fan-favourite last weekend.\n\nSpeaking about Nwaneri's performance last Saturday, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta [told the BBC's Match of the Day](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cr7rnmy190lt): \"He is the second youngest \\[Premier League goalscorer\\] in our history.

The 26-year-old also has four assists to his name.\n\nAs a result of his spectacular form, Gyokeres has been linked with a host of different clubs around the continent, including the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Barcelona.\n\nHowever, since Ruben Amorim left Sporting for Old Trafford, reports linking Gyokeres with a move to United have picked up.\n\nIt has now been claimed that the striker has made up his mind on which club he wants to join in the future.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, Gyokeres has his eyes set on a move to Old Trafford, in what would be a reunion with former boss Amorim.\n\nThe report stated: \"SunSport understands Sporting Lisbon striker Gyokeres has his heart set on a move to the Premier League and a reunion with ex-boss Ruben Amorim at Manchester United.\"\n\nBefore joining United, Amorim was asked about potentially reuniting with Gyokeres at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Portuguese said: \"No, no, no. I cannot be funny with that in this moment. It was tough for me to leave, if I start joking about that with Gyokeres, I’ll have problems. This is my city, this is my country, I will respect.\n\n\"Viktor has to stay until the end of the season and then his life is going, maybe, somewhere else.\"\n\nWhen asked about Amorim, Gyokeres himself said: \"We will miss him a lot, of course.\n\n\"We achieved a lot together and we will miss him and the other members of the staff, but they are leaving and we have to move on and face the next challenge we have.\"\n\nGyokeres is set to start for Sporting as they resume their UEFA Champions League campaign against Arsenal at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday night.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It goes for all three of them, Virgil and Trent too, they are so focused on the next game and being leaders.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot also spoke out about the incident, assuring fans that nobody at the club is concerned or distracted by it, certainly not Salah himself.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think Mo is distracted at all. He just keeps on scoring. He is fully focused. The media and fans talk about it but at the AXA I didn't see anyone talking about it.\"\n\nThe Scotsman is the first current Liverpool player to speak about Salah's comments, after former player Jamie Carragher spoke out against the winger on Monday.\n\n“I must say, I am very disappointed with Mo Salah,” Carragher said on Sky Sports’ MNF.\n\n“With that interview yesterday…Liverpool have got Real Madrid midweek and Manchester City at the weekend – that’s the story for Liverpool right now.\n\n“And Mo Salah, we’re all quite aware…that in the seven years he has been at the football club, he’s stopped in the mixed zone twice, which is his right, which is absolutely fine.\n\n“But he decided to stop for the third time away at Southampton on the back of winning Liverpool the game.”\n\n\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

[Jamie Redknapp](https://www.sportbible.com/jamie-redknapp), meanwhile, was heard telling the group to \"just leave it\".\n\nNow, season ticket holder Neil Finbow, 55, has given a further insight into the row after standing right next to the former Manchester United captain as the incident played out.\n\n\"It was the guy in the middle's comments that got him, I think,\" Finbow told [**The Mirror**](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ipswich-fan-roy-keane-manutd-34181330). \"He was going on about his time when he was manager, how he treated his kids.\"\n\nFinbow continued: \"I will sort of defend [Roy Keane](https://www.sportbible.com/roy-keane) here as well, because it may be that the comment 'I'll see you in the car park' is to talk to the guy rather than take him out, so it can be misconstrued. I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\n\n\"The guy had an issue, when \\[Keane\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that. So obviously that's been pent-up.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't have any regrets \\[about going down the front\\]. It's pent-up anger. No swear words came out of my mouth, I just said 'you're a better pundit than you are a manager'.\"\n\nSky Sports will reportedly investigate the incident to see if any action is needed, while Finbow admits he is concerned about the future of his season ticket.\n\n\"Everyone I sit with knows what I'm like,\" he said. \"I'm in the family bit there, I've been there for years. I do worry about my season ticket, someone has put on there that it could affect it, but I don't think I've been abusive or anything. If people class that as abuse then it's just gone mad.\"\n\nFinbow added: \"I want my side to be heard, that it was more sarcasm than anything. To be fair, he's provoked it by coming over, hasn't he? I was actually saying 'calm down, Roy', funnily enough, which I've been telling a lot of my friends to do this morning.\n\n_SPORTbible have reached out to Sky Sports for comment._\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\n\n\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\n\n\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\"\n\nHe added: \"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\"\n\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\n\n\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\" he said.\n\n\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\"\n\nAmorim added: \"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\n\n\"As well as being the best player in the Premier League he’s a cultural icon across the Arab world and beyond.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

        "article_headline": "Liverpool fans spot what Virgil van Dijk did during bombshell Mo Salah interview as new footage emerges",
        "article_text": "**New footage has emerged showing exactly what Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk did when he saw Mo Salah speaking to the media.** Salah, 32, scored twice in the 3-2 victory at St Mary’s as the Reds went eight points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. The brace took his tally to ten goals and six assists in just twelve league games this term. But it was Salah’s post-match comments that hit the headlines following the result. The forward admitted that he was “probably more out than in” when discussing whether he had been offered a new contract by the club. Salah is just one of three of Liverpool’s key players whose contract is set to expire following the 2024/25 campaign - with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk’s futures still uncertain. The latter of the trio, who featured against his former side on Sunday, could not help but react when he saw Salah speaking to the media scrum outside the Players Entrance at St Mary’s. While the Egyptian was voicing his thoughts to the gathered journalists, Van Dijk slowly walked towards him before smirking and catching Salah’s eye, who also appeared to find the situation amusing. Fans on social were quick to give their thoughts on Van Dijk’s reaction. One said: “Mo's body language became more unsettled once VVD showed up, and he became aware of it. Almost like he got caught doing something he shouldn't have, haha.” A second added: “What a mess so far by LFC. Poor summer window signing a crocked winger and a keeper when we have two of the best. “Failure to get a midfielder and now on the cusp of losing club legends. No contract will outweigh the cost of replacement and the drop in output. Get it done!” With a third saying: “If Mo, Virgil and Trent leave, it’ll be extremely embarrassing and disastrous to FSG. Everything at Liverpool is going through these players. Can’t afford to lose even one of them.” While a fourth exclaimed: “I think Virg knows something might be coming up. No way our captain isn't in on it.”",

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\nRuben Amorim watches on from the sideline during Man Utd's 1-1 draw with Ipswich (Image: Getty)\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Sky Sports / GettyTopics: [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united), [Ipswich Town](https://www.sportbible.com/ipswich-town), [Ruben Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim), [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league)\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\n\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\n\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\n\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\n\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\n\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\n\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s [1-1 draw at Ipswich](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report). Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now, and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\-1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\-6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\-7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\-8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\-8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\-10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\-7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\-15 | 4\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\n\nAs well as being the best player in the Premier League he’s a cultural icon across the Arab world and beyond.\"",

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things. \"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half. Ruben Amorim watches on from the sideline during Man Utd's 1-1 draw with Ipswich (Image: Getty) \"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work. \"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\" United are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\-1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\-6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\-7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\-8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\-8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\-10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\-7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\-15 | 4\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\n===========================================================\n\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\n\n1\n\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\n---------------------------------\n\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**",

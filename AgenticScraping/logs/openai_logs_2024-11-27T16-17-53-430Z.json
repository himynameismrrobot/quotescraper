unusual way of singling out players when he is making generic points.\\n    \\n    He did it on Sunday when he spoke about his players having difficulties adapting to his new system, pointing to an instance when Jonny Evans found himself in the wrong place.\\n    \\n    Today in his news conference, Amorim explained he was using Evans to emphasise the point he was making rather than being critical.\\n    \\n    A couple of answers later, he was talking about players needing to score goals and said Amad Diallo needs to be better at it.\\n    \\n    This is good, but it is also a bit dangerous because at some point the subtlety might be lost and it will come across as a direct criticism, which it isn't.\\n    \\n    Then, it will turn into a storm he then has to deal with when he next speaks to the media.\\n    \\n    *   [Not a Man Utd fan?

I am really well aware of that.\\n    \\n    \\\"During training I try to absorb everything, from every position. I try to have an understanding of the game because being the captain, the manager cannot always give the message from the bench to the pitch. As captain, you have to try to resolve the situation together with your team-mates. Having knowledge of every position is my role.\\\"\\n    \\n    Fernandes has four goals and two assists in his past five games in all competitions in November after initially struggling for goal contributions at the start of the season. He is confident he will settle quickly into Amorim's tactical setup.\\n    \\n    \\\"I think \\\\[adapting to the system\\\\] could probably be worse for the younger players - I know what the Sporting players were doing very well,\\\" he added. \\\"Not because I was reading what the manager was doing, but because I was watching their games!\\n    \\n    \\\"We are international players. Every time you go to the national team, you probably play in a different system. With Portugal, we sometimes play with a back three. I've had that experience of the manager's formation already.\\\"\\n    \\n4.

Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond.\\n    \\n    ‌Certainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\\n    \\n    ‌The fact that they were not demonstrably better than promoted [Ipswich](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town), after a fabulous start, shows the road is long, and he will need some time, probably quite a lot.\\n    \\n    ‌Will it be a match made in heaven? It has more chance than Steve Cooper had at [Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city). If ever there was a poisoned chalice, this was it for the former [Nottingham Forest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest) manager, that was a union doomed to failure.\\n    \\n    *   [Not a Man Utd fan?

That is why Amorim will have a place for the 22-year-old.\\n    \\n    As a wing-back, Amad is also expected to carry out defensive duties, and he was kept busy in that department at Portman Road with 71 touches of the ball. He won five of his eight duels and made five clearances against the Tractor Boys.\\n    \\n    Amad could be used as a number 10 in Amorim’s system – alongside Bruno Fernandes – as he has energy in abundance to carry out that role if required, as seen during his stint at Sunderland under Tony Mowbray.\\n    \\n    The Ivory Coast international has been knocking on the door at United for some time, but he deserves the opportunities he’s got this season.\\n    \\n    After a match-winning display against PAOK in the Europa League earlier this month, there is reason to believe Amad will become an important player under Amorim at United.\\n    \\n    Further proof that hard work pays off.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Dale O'Donnell at_ [_Stretty News_, external](https://strettynews.com/)\\n    \\n    ![Image 30: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream

However, Mainoo's performance was as equally impressive.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **['Adaptable' - Gary Neville names four United players who will be key for Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adaptable-gary-neville-names-four-30452462)**\\n\\nSitting at the base of the midfield, the then-18-year-old bossed proceedings, leaving almost everyone watching in awe of just how accomplished he looked. You would have been forgiven for thinking he was making his 100th [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) start and not his first.\\n\\nHis performance at Goodison Park meant he immediately became a mainstay in Ten Hag's plans; he started 23 of [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) 25 remaining Premier League matches last season. He is a generational talent and United have incredibly high hopes for him.\\n\\nHowever, the midfielder, after overcoming a six-week absence due to a muscle injury, was not deemed ready to make [Ruben Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) first United starting XI at Portman Road on Sunday. He was named on the bench alongside fellow midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount.\\n\\nOf that midfield trio, [Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo) was the only member of it not to step off the bench. But after several weeks on the sidelines, United are well within their rights not to rush his return.\\n\\nBut the fact he made the matchday squad has to be considered as a positive. He could make his first appearance of the Amorim era when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the Europa League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAmorim started with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in the centre of midfield on Sunday, supported by Diogo Dalot and [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) in the two wing-back roles. Eriksen and Casemiro, who helped form United's strongest midfield in 2022/23, have a combined age of 64.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 64: Casemiro plays a pass to ease pressure from Ipswich Town ace Omari Hutchinson.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30453145.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186660711.jpg)\\n\\nCasemiro started in a two-man midfield against Ipswich Town. (Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nWhat quickly became clear during Amorim's debut in the dugout, as expected, was that he wants United to play with energy and aggression. He wants his team to press high up the pitch and move the ball with both speed and purpose.\\n\\nAs experienced as both Casemiro and Eriksen are, they are unlikely to remain starters under Amorim. They have both enjoyed outstanding careers, but they are now each at a juncture where all they can offer is a short-term solution.\\n\\nThat fear was highlighted during Jamie Carragher's analysis of United's performance at Ipswich on _Monday Night Football,_ where he highlighted a point in the first half when Amorim was animated with Casemiro for not pressing higher up the pitch. Carragher argued the Brazilian did not appear to be comfortable with moving out of his natural habitat as a midfield destroyer in the No.6 berth.\\n\\nBy the time Mainoo turns 20 in April, Casemiro will have already celebrated his 33rd birthday, likewise Eriksen. Mainoo is 13 years their junior and will naturally have more energy in the tank.\\n\\nThe United academy graduate is a forward-thinking, progressive midfielder, who has the legs to get around the pitch much quicker. He can also move the ball faster and help United break the lines.\\n\\nHad Mainoo not spent several weeks on the sidelines prior to Amorim's appointment, the chances are he would have started in Suffolk. The same could be said for Ugarte, who was away with Uruguay on international duty last week and only had two training sessions prior to the trip to Ipswich.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 65: Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte track the run of Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30415719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2173571204.jpg)\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo (left) and Manuel Ugarte (right) have only started one game together for Manchester United. (Image: Harriet Lander/Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe general expectation is that Mainoo and Ugarte will end up forming Amorim's first-choice midfield. It is a combination that has the potential to become a long-term partnership.\\n\\nMainoo and Ugarte both have the legs and the energy required to press man-for-man. Amorim is evidently hungry for United to show more energy than what they have done so far this season.\\n\\nAs well as being happy to press, Mainoo can also add a turn of speed and athleticism to United's midfield, enabling them to progress the ball quicker. That particular trait was missing at Portman Road.\\n\\nWithout even playing a single minute under Amorim thus far, Mainoo's omission on Sunday highlighted just how important he could be. He could quite easily form the pillar of Amorim's vision.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream

Today in his news conference, Amorim explained he was using Evans to emphasise the point he was making rather than being critical.\n    \n    A couple of answers later, he was talking about players needing to score goals and said Amad Diallo needs to be better at it. This is good, but it is also a bit dangerous because at some point the subtlety might be lost and it will come across as a direct criticism, which it isn't. Then, it will turn into a storm he then has to deal with when he next speaks to the media.\n\n2.  **Josh Lobley**  \n    BBC Sport Journalist\n    \n    Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Europa League game against Bodo/Glimt. Here are the key lines from his news conference:\n    \n    *   He was asked if Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez will be available for Thursday's match: \"Not Harry. Lisandro is ready. I felt he's had enough time so he is ready. Harry will be ready soon and on the pitch also.\"\n    \n3.  **Pat Nevin**  \n    Former footballer and presenter\n    \n    After Liverpool's win at Southampton, all eyes shifted to the real story on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s first decisions as Manchester United coach are as much discussed in the UK as Donald Trump’s White House cabinet selections attract attention over the pond. Certainly, United now have a plan, but whether it is a good one that suits the players is less certain. The identity of a harder working, energetic side has already been demanded by the new coach. The suspicion is that he will need a lot of action in the transfer market rather than the training ground to achieve this.\n    \n4.  **Dale O'Donnell**  \n    Fan writer\n    \n    Amad Diallo has been working his way into Manchester United’s plans, but now is the time for the winger to stake his importance to Ruben Amorim. Last Sunday, we saw Amad deployed as one of two wing-back options in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town. Amorim had just two training sessions with his matchday squad to prepare his players for their first game. The Portuguese coach wasted no time implementing his preferred 3-4-3 formation, with Diogo Dalot named as the opposite wing-back...\n    \nThis is good, but it is also a bit dangerous because at some point the subtlety might be lost and it will come across as a direct criticism, which it isn't. Then, it will turn into a storm he then has to deal with when he next speaks to the media.\n    \nWhen I watch United, I want our wide players hurting teams down the flanks, and Amad has the energy to be a threat throughout games. That is why Amorim will have a place for the 22-year-old.\n\n    \n    # Quotes from article\n    [{\"speaker_name\":\"Ruben Amorim\",\"raw_quote_text\":\"[In response to a question about player availability] Not Harry.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nAmorim was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\n\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former Premier League striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at Old Trafford after several new signings are added to the squad.\n\n\"Because Manchester United were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for Optus Sport.\n\n\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\n\n\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\n\n\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\n\n\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

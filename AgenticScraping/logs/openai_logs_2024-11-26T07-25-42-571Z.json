Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n5.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area.

They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\n\\\"I know after that goal with the confidence we have to have more ball and we can do it.\\\"\\n\\nAndre Onana was United's best performer by a distance and his steady season continued with three impressive stops from Sammie Szmodics and two either side of half-time from Liam Delap.\\n\\n\\\"I think it’s so clear for everybody, he saved us two times, at least,\\\" Amorim admitted. \\\"And one important thing is he did long balls and tried to connect with players, that was very good for me, he understood the idea.

\\\"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis).\\n\\n\\\"So it’s like a winger follows the left back. It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO

\\\"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis).\\n\\n\\\"So it’s like a winger follows the left back. It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO

improve](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorims-gestures-show-what-30440854)**\\n\\n\\\"I think it was very good, he has improved a lot,\\\" Amorim said of Amad. \\\"Since these three days, he improved so much defensively but for him the opponent he had all the time was the left back (Leif Davis).\\n\\n\\\"So it’s like a winger follows the left back. It’s so much easier I think because he doesn’t have to think, 'can I jump in the centre back or not?' He just follows one guy and goes forward and it’s like a game of man-to-man game in that area. He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"All the team (did well for the goal) but they are top players, you just put them in positions. They do one-two, run with the ball, good movement from Rash and Garna (Alejandro Garnacho) was also there to score, (Diogo) Dalot was in position, we managed to score.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO

A hamstring issue and head injury reduced Mount to just four [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) appearances, seven in all competitions, this season, with his latest coming as a late substitute during Sunday's draw at Ipswich.\\n\\nIn two seasons at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), Mount has mustered just 27 appearances providing one goal and one assist.

But Mount was among those who made an early impression.\\n\\n\\\"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,\\\" Amorim said on Friday. \\\"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad.

Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were the best performers of the so-called ‘big six’ with £305.7m.\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/11bn-reason-ruben-amorim-find-30450630#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Sir Jim Ratcliffe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-jim-ratcliffe)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457)\\n\\n['Be amazed' -

Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were the best performers of the so-called ‘big six’ with £305.7m.\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end.

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThat deal handed the British billionaire oversight over football matters, as well as leading the plan for what happens with Old Trafford’s future and the plans for a new stadium.\\n\\nAmorim - who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag earlier this month - is the first changing of the managerial guard since Ratcliffe’s arrival as a minority owner of the club, and the noises already have pointed toward a change in shift when it comes to transfer policy. Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were the best performers of the so-called ‘big six’ with £305.7m.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['We will suffer' -

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThat deal handed the British billionaire oversight over football matters, as well as leading the plan for what happens with Old Trafford’s future and the plans for a new stadium.\\n\\nAmorim - who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag earlier this month - is the first changing of the managerial guard since Ratcliffe’s arrival as a minority owner of the club, and the noises already have pointed toward a change in shift when it comes to transfer policy. Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['We will suffer' -

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThat deal handed the British billionaire oversight over football matters, as well as leading the plan for what happens with Old Trafford’s future and the plans for a new stadium.\\n\\nAmorim - who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag earlier this month - is the first changing of the managerial guard since Ratcliffe’s arrival as a minority owner of the club, and the noises already have pointed toward a change in shift when it comes to transfer policy. Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['We will suffer' -

Liverpool right now.\\n\\n“And Mo Salah, we’re all quite aware…that in the seven years he has been at the football club, he’s stopped in the mixed zone twice, which is his right, which is absolutely fine.\\n\\n“But he decided to stop for the third time away at Southampton on the back of winning Liverpool the game.”\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nHowever, Carragher had seemingly given a less harsh view of the situation earlier in the broadcast and gave a considered take on what he felt the issue between both parties is.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's pretty obvious what the issue is what Mo Salah feels he's worth, whether that's in financial terms or length of contract is completely different to what Liverpool feel at this moment,\\\" explained Carragher.\\n\\nPowered By\\n\\n10 Sec\\n\\nJamie Carragher hits

A hamstring issue and head injury reduced Mount to just four [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) appearances, seven in all competitions, this season, with his latest coming as a late substitute during Sunday's draw at Ipswich.\\n\\nIn two seasons at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), Mount has mustered just 27 appearances providing one goal and one assist.

But Mount was among those who made an early impression.\\n\\n\\\"Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,\\\" Amorim said on Friday. \\\"You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad.

stage, we will be here with the same problems.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, his job could be made easier in the January transfer window, which may allow him to bring in his own choice of players.\\n\\nSporting’s Geovany Quenda, 17, is reportedly the subject of interest from United, with Amorim’s former club ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign the player, according to [A BOLA](https://x.com/abolapt).\\n\\nThe right-winger/wing-back has featured 11 times in Liga Portugal this season and is already used to Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 1: Geovany

Quenda has been linked with Manchester United (Credit:Getty)\\n\\nQuenda became Sporting’s youngest-ever goal scorer when he netted in a 4-3 loss against Porto in the Portuguese Super Cup in August - breaking [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.sportbible.com/cristiano-ronaldo)’s record.\\n\\nIt is unclear if the Portugal youth international would slot straight into Amorim’s starting XI, but he would likely provide competition for Amad, who started yesterday’s match as United’s right-winger/wing-back.\\n\\nThe Ivorian is used to playing in a more advanced role, and given the fact usual left-back Diogo Dalot started on the left flank, it would be fair to say this leaves the side unbalanced.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nAnd it is not just Quenda who is being monitored.\\n\\nAccording to [Scouts in Attendance](https://x.com/scoutsattending/status/1860969052211941793), United, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona will have scouts at Sporting’s Champions League match against Arsenal on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe highly rated forward Viktor Gyökeres is reportedly being ‘monitored’ by some of Europe’s top clubs, with the Sweden international having already scored 24 times in 19 appearances for the Portuguese club this term.\\n\\nThe 26-year-old's current deal is set to run until 2028 meaning a hefty fee of around £62m may need to be offered for Sporting to consider

The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

United chief executive Omar Berrada is a big fan. Going after him also made sense.\\n    \\n    The problem is having made the calls, United are now in a position where the new coach is trying to implement a new playing style, knowing there are too many midweek matches looming to allow proper training on shape and positioning, which may lead to unexpected defeats.\\n    \\n    As a club, they cannot afford to just toss away seasons as part of a big rebuild.

They will look to go one better when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday night (8pm kick-off).\\n\\nAs well as preparing for upcoming games, Amorim is also likely to be looking ahead to the January transfer window. After having some time to assess his squad, the new head coach may have a chance to bring in a couple of his players when the window opens at the start of next year.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream move](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-strongest-line-up-30458500)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United dealt Euro blow as they face UEFA Youth League challenge](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-dealt-euro-blow-30458176)**\\n\\nSo, it’s no surprise that United continue to be linked with players. With that in mind, MEN Sport have taken a look at a couple of the stories doing the rounds, and given our own thoughts on the situation.\\n\\n#### United ‘eye’ £83m man\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are reportedly interested in a move for Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window. Sportmediaset, via [Get Italian Football News](https://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2024/manchester-united-serious-in-move-for-napolis-khvicha-kvaratskhelia/) report that United are 'serious' about the player, but would need to offer a fee of around €100 million (£83.48m) to temp Napoli into selling.\\n\\nNapoli are said to be keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached, and United are said to be willing to offer a bigger deal to the player.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _Ruben Amorim is likely to be keen to add his own players to his squad when the January transfer window opens. However, how big of a budget he will have is still to be seen._\\n\\n_While Kvaratskhelia is highly-rated, the 23-year-old has scored five times and provided two assists in 13 Serie A appearances this season, it seems unlikely that United will pay the asking price in the January window. It may be a move to keep a closer eye on in the summer window._\\n\\n#### Striker transfer truth\\n\\nAn update has been given on United’s reported interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. Reports earlier this month claimed that United had held talks over a potential loan deal for the forward in the January transfer window.\\n\\nHowever, Sky Sports Germany’s Florian Plettenberg claims that there has been no discussions over the player. Instead, the journalist names Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush as on a list of potential targets ahead of the January window.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _United’s search for a striker in January could depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. There has been reports over clubs being interested in a loan deal, but I can’t see that happening just six months into his Old Trafford Career._\\n\\n_Getting a loan deal for Kolo Muani, only to send Zirkzee on loan doesn’t really make too much sense. But a possible permanent deal for Marmoush, who has been linked with several Premier League clubs, could be an interesting one to keep an eye on._\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

[More info](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/privacy-notice)\\n\\n[Join us on WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IG57qlIoDZM56XwrenyELG)\\n\\nManchester United head coach [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) will have his first taste of European football at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) this week, after what may be seen as a disappointing start in the Premier League.\\n\\nThe Red Devils [drew 1-1 with newly-promoted Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825) in the new boss’ first game in charge on Sunday afternoon. They will look to go one better when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday night (8pm kick-off).\\n\\nAs well as preparing for upcoming games, Amorim is also likely to be looking ahead to the January transfer window. After having some time to assess his squad, the new head coach may have a chance to bring in a couple of his players when the window opens at the start of next year.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream move](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-strongest-line-up-30458500)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United dealt Euro blow as they face UEFA Youth League challenge](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-dealt-euro-blow-30458176)**\\n\\nSo, it’s no surprise that United continue to be linked with players. With that in mind, MEN Sport have taken a look at a couple of the stories doing the rounds, and given our own thoughts on the situation.\\n\\n#### United ‘eye’ £83m man\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are reportedly interested in a move for Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window. Sportmediaset, via [Get Italian Football News](https://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2024/manchester-united-serious-in-move-for-napolis-khvicha-kvaratskhelia/) report that United are 'serious' about the player, but would need to offer a fee of around €100 million (£83.48m) to temp Napoli into selling.\\n\\nNapoli are said to be keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached, and United are said to be willing to offer a bigger deal to the player.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _Ruben Amorim is likely to be keen to add his own players to his squad when the January transfer window opens. However, how big of a budget he will have is still to be seen._\\n\\n_While Kvaratskhelia is highly-rated, the 23-year-old has scored five times and provided two assists in 13 Serie A appearances this season, it seems unlikely that United will pay the asking price in the January window. It may be a move to keep a closer eye on in the summer window._\\n\\n#### Striker transfer truth\\n\\nAn update has been given on United’s reported interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. Reports earlier this month claimed that United had held talks over a potential loan deal for the forward in the January transfer window.\\n\\nHowever, Sky Sports Germany’s Florian Plettenberg claims that there has been no discussions over the player. Instead, the journalist names Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush as on a list of potential targets ahead of the January window.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _United’s search for a striker in January could depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. There has been reports over clubs being interested in a loan deal, but I can’t see that happening just six months into his Old Trafford Career._\\n\\n_Getting a loan deal for Kolo Muani, only to send Zirkzee on loan doesn’t really make too much sense. But a possible permanent deal for Marmoush, who has been linked with several Premier League clubs, could be an interesting one to keep an eye on._\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United

They will look to go one better when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday night (8pm kick-off).\\n\\nAs well as preparing for upcoming games, Amorim is also likely to be looking ahead to the January transfer window. After having some time to assess his squad, the new head coach may have a chance to bring in a couple of his players when the window opens at the start of next year.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream move](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-strongest-line-up-30458500)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United dealt Euro blow as they face UEFA Youth League challenge](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-dealt-euro-blow-30458176)**\\n\\nSo, it’s no surprise that United continue to be linked with players. With that in mind, MEN Sport have taken a look at a couple of the stories doing the rounds, and given our own thoughts on the situation.\\n\\n#### United ‘eye’ £83m man\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are reportedly interested in a move for Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window. Sportmediaset, via [Get Italian Football News](https://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2024/manchester-united-serious-in-move-for-napolis-khvicha-kvaratskhelia/) report that United are 'serious' about the player, but would need to offer a fee of around €100 million (£83.48m) to temp Napoli into selling.\\n\\nNapoli are said to be keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached, and United are said to be willing to offer a bigger deal to the player.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _Ruben Amorim is likely to be keen to add his own players to his squad when the January transfer window opens. However, how big of a budget he will have is still to be seen._\\n\\n_While Kvaratskhelia is highly-rated, the 23-year-old has scored five times and provided two assists in 13 Serie A appearances this season, it seems unlikely that United will pay the asking price in the January window. It may be a move to keep a closer eye on in the summer window._\\n\\n#### Striker transfer truth\\n\\nAn update has been given on United’s reported interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. Reports earlier this month claimed that United had held talks over a potential loan deal for the forward in the January transfer window.\\n\\nHowever, Sky Sports Germany’s Florian Plettenberg claims that there has been no discussions over the player. Instead, the journalist names Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush as on a list of potential targets ahead of the January window.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _United’s search for a striker in January could depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. There has been reports over clubs being interested in a loan deal, but I can’t see that happening just six months into his Old Trafford Career._\\n\\n_Getting a loan deal for Kolo Muani, only to send Zirkzee on loan doesn’t really make too much sense. But a possible permanent deal for Marmoush, who has been linked with several Premier League clubs, could be an interesting one to keep an eye on._\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United

They will look to go one better when Bodo/Glimt visit Old Trafford in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday night (8pm kick-off).\\n\\nAs well as preparing for upcoming games, Amorim is also likely to be looking ahead to the January transfer window. After having some time to assess his squad, the new head coach may have a chance to bring in a couple of his players when the window opens at the start of next year.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United's strongest line-up after Evan Ferguson signing as Ruben Amorim handed dream move](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-strongest-line-up-30458500)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United dealt Euro blow as they face UEFA Youth League challenge](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-dealt-euro-blow-30458176)**\\n\\nSo, it’s no surprise that United continue to be linked with players. With that in mind, MEN Sport have taken a look at a couple of the stories doing the rounds, and given our own thoughts on the situation.\\n\\n#### United ‘eye’ £83m man\\n\\n[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) are reportedly interested in a move for Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ahead of the January transfer window. Sportmediaset, via [Get Italian Football News](https://www.getfootballnewsitaly.com/2024/manchester-united-serious-in-move-for-napolis-khvicha-kvaratskhelia/) report that United are 'serious' about the player, but would need to offer a fee of around €100 million (£83.48m) to temp Napoli into selling.\\n\\nNapoli are said to be keen on getting the player tied down to a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2027. However, no agreement has yet been reached, and United are said to be willing to offer a bigger deal to the player.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _Ruben Amorim is likely to be keen to add his own players to his squad when the January transfer window opens. However, how big of a budget he will have is still to be seen._\\n\\n_While Kvaratskhelia is highly-rated, the 23-year-old has scored five times and provided two assists in 13 Serie A appearances this season, it seems unlikely that United will pay the asking price in the January window. It may be a move to keep a closer eye on in the summer window._\\n\\n#### Striker transfer truth\\n\\nAn update has been given on United’s reported interest in Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani. Reports earlier this month claimed that United had held talks over a potential loan deal for the forward in the January transfer window.\\n\\nHowever, Sky Sports Germany’s Florian Plettenberg claims that there has been no discussions over the player. Instead, the journalist names Eintracht Frankfurt’s Omar Marmoush as on a list of potential targets ahead of the January window.\\n\\n**MENSport says**: _United’s search for a striker in January could depend on the future of Joshua Zirkzee. There has been reports over clubs being interested in a loan deal, but I can’t see that happening just six months into his Old Trafford Career._\\n\\n_Getting a loan deal for Kolo Muani, only to send Zirkzee on loan doesn’t really make too much sense. But a possible permanent deal for Marmoush, who has been linked with several Premier League clubs, could be an interesting one to keep an eye on._\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager. Sixth, easy!\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

The 39-year-old took charge of his first match at the weekend which saw the Reds held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was appointed as United boss with the club well adrift of the top four spots, and currently find themselves in 12th place after the stalemate at Portman Road. Six points separate United from fourth, while the Reds are only three behind Tottenham Hotspur in sixth place.\\n\\nIt's sixth spot that Wright believes is the most likely position for United to finish this season, which would see the club qualify for Europe in the process. The former [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) striker believes that Amorim will enjoy success at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) after several new signings are added to the squad.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United confirm first quarter financial results as Omar Berrada sends message**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n\\\"Because [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were 14th when it was all happening and he's coming in, he gives me the impression of someone that has been given time - 'Just do your stuff and play your football',\\\" said Wright on The Kelly & Wrighty Show for [Optus Sport](https://sport.optus.com.au/epl/videos/os83772/os83772-the-kelly-and-wrighty-show).\\n\\n\\\"That's his formation, he said that when he took the job - 'That's how I know how to play and that's how we're going to play'.\\n\\n\\\"I believe once he gets his players in and they start getting it, it is a free hit against these teams for the rest of this season because Manchester United were in 14th!\\n\\n\\\"Whatever he gets from the end of this season is only going to stand him in good stead for the summer because if it does finish well for him, they're going to probably give him whatever he wants.\\n\\n\\\"For this season, if Manchester United can blast themselves up into sixth and all that, it's perfect for what they're doing with a new manager.

After he left [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on the Monday, [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) wasted little time finding his successor with Ruben Amorim appointed the following Friday.\\n\\nDue to an agreement with Sporting Lisbon, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) did not begin work at Old Trafford until Monday, November 11 - the start of the final international break of the year. As such, his first match in charge of the club came on Sunday when United drew 1-1 at Ipswich Town despite taking the lead inside 90 seconds.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on three United weaknesses during warm-ups](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United have new contender for key Amorim role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\nOf course, it will take longer than one match to implement a new style on this United team but former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott believes the Reds need to let this season go particularly with such a relentless run of games between now and the new year. He told [Sky Sports' Monday Night Football](https://www.skysports.com/): \\\"That \\\\[implementing a new season\\\\] is the difficulty he is going to have at this part of the season.\\n\\n\\\"The November/December period before [Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/christmas) is for me always an interesting time where it is all about recovery for the players. I think at times now, the players are just going to have to get on with it and need to learn really quickly.\\n\\n\\\"They will do a lot of walkthrough, I would have thought, but they need to get in the habits, plant the seed which will be repetition, repetition just to adapt to the system. They will have to learn very quickly but I think as well, they need to just write off this season.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a long time \\\\[of pain\\\\] for [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and they are going to have to accept that as they have got the man they want now.

After playing as a right-back, a left-back and as an attacking-midfielder under former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager Erik ten Hag, his successor, Ruben Amorim, deployed him as a right-sided centre-back for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nSetting up with the 3-4-3 formation that had been religiously analysed ever since succeeding Ten Hag on November 1, the former Sporting Lisbon boss tasked [Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) with operating on the right side of the back-three. He was joined in the defence by [Matthijs de Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nOf that rearguard, only De Ligt will be considered as a staple in United's first-choice backline once everyone is fit and available. The general expectation is that once Amorim has overseen a reduction in the size of the current injury list, De Ligt will be joined in defence by fellow summer signing [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) and Lisandro Martinez.\\n\\nYoro was not included in the matchday squad at Portman Road, with United continuing to monitor his recovery from a fractured metatarsal carefully, and Martinez missed out due to a back injury. With Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof also missing, Amorim had no choice but to make do with what he had available.\\n\\nHowever, as reported by the _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-takes-decision-leny-30417554)_ last week, Yoro is understood to be on the cusp of making his competitive debut for United. It is possible he could be awarded it this week, either against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night or when Everton visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nYoro was United's statement signing of the summer, being signed from Lille in a deal initially worth £52.2million. He was on Real Madrid's radar but yet United convinced him to move to Old Trafford.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Leny Yoro smiles for the camera as he is pictured in training at Carrington.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30456869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185450759.jpg)\\n\\nLeny Yoro could soon make his competitive debut for Manchester United. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe feeling is he will soon occupy the right-sided centre-back berth Mazraoui held against Ipswich. Once Martinez is back, he should join Yoro and De Ligt in making up United's first-choice back-three.\\n\\nHowever, Martinez's return is understood not to be imminent, opening up a window of opportunity for someone else to stake a claim for the left-sided centre-back berth. That someone could be [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw).\\n\\nA whopping 280 days after he made his last United appearance, the England international made his long-awaited comeback against Ipswich, appearing as a second half substitute. He slotted into the left-sided centre-back role after replacing Evans.\\n\\nShaw has experience of playing centrally for United, being tasked with playing as a left-sided centre-back several times by Ten Hag during the 2022/23 season. He admitted after a 1-0 win over Wolves on New Year's Eve in 2022 that he was \\\"really enjoying\\\" the responsibility.\\n\\nAfter so long out, United's primary mission has to be managing Shaw's load carefully and keeping him out of the treatment room. They cannot afford to push him too quickly.\\n\\nBut if he is deemed fit enough to start for United at any point within the next week or so, he is a credible option to start in the left-sided centre-back berth. He has the ball-playing ability to play in a central area and he is defensively sound.\\n\\nOf course, Martinez should be reinstated as United's chief left-sided centre-back once he recovers from his current injury, but Shaw is a solid option to compete with him and provide rotation.\\n\\nThe prospect of Yoro debuting in the coming days and Shaw being deemed fit enough to start will provide United with two very welcomed boosts. Yoro's addition to the squad in July was greeted with a wave of appreciation and Shaw, regardless of his injury concerns, is a fantastic player when he is fit.\\n\\nThe prospect of those two operating either side of De Ligt in a back-three would offer United something completely different to what was on show at Ipswich, and Amorim would be well within his rights to test the water with that approach.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top

After playing as a right-back, a left-back and as an attacking-midfielder under former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager Erik ten Hag, his successor, Ruben Amorim, deployed him as a right-sided centre-back for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nSetting up with the 3-4-3 formation that had been religiously analysed ever since succeeding Ten Hag on November 1, the former Sporting Lisbon boss tasked [Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) with operating on the right side of the back-three. He was joined in the defence by [Matthijs de Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nOf that rearguard, only De Ligt will be considered as a staple in United's first-choice backline once everyone is fit and available. The general expectation is that once Amorim has overseen a reduction in the size of the current injury list, De Ligt will be joined in defence by fellow summer signing [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) and Lisandro Martinez.\\n\\nYoro was not included in the matchday squad at Portman Road, with United continuing to monitor his recovery from a fractured metatarsal carefully, and Martinez missed out due to a back injury. With Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof also missing, Amorim had no choice but to make do with what he had available.\\n\\nHowever, as reported by the _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-takes-decision-leny-30417554)_ last week, Yoro is understood to be on the cusp of making his competitive debut for United. It is possible he could be awarded it this week, either against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night or when Everton visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nYoro was United's statement signing of the summer, being signed from Lille in a deal initially worth £52.2million. He was on Real Madrid's radar but yet United convinced him to move to Old Trafford.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Leny Yoro smiles for the camera as he is pictured in training at Carrington.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30456869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185450759.jpg)\\n\\nLeny Yoro could soon make his competitive debut for Manchester United. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe feeling is he will soon occupy the right-sided centre-back berth Mazraoui held against Ipswich. Once Martinez is back, he should join Yoro and De Ligt in making up United's first-choice back-three.\\n\\nHowever, Martinez's return is understood not to be imminent, opening up a window of opportunity for someone else to stake a claim for the left-sided centre-back berth. That someone could be [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw).\\n\\nA whopping 280 days after he made his last United appearance, the England international made his long-awaited comeback against Ipswich, appearing as a second half substitute. He slotted into the left-sided centre-back role after replacing Evans.\\n\\nShaw has experience of playing centrally for United, being tasked with playing as a left-sided centre-back several times by Ten Hag during the 2022/23 season. He admitted after a 1-0 win over Wolves on New Year's Eve in 2022 that he was \\\"really enjoying\\\" the responsibility.\\n\\nAfter so long out, United's primary mission has to be managing Shaw's load carefully and keeping him out of the treatment room. They cannot afford to push him too quickly.\\n\\nBut if he is deemed fit enough to start for United at any point within the next week or so, he is a credible option to start in the left-sided centre-back berth. He has the ball-playing ability to play in a central area and he is defensively sound.\\n\\nOf course, Martinez should be reinstated as United's chief left-sided centre-back once he recovers from his current injury, but Shaw is a solid option to compete with him and provide rotation.\\n\\nThe prospect of Yoro debuting in the coming days and Shaw being deemed fit enough to start will provide United with two very welcomed boosts. Yoro's addition to the squad in July was greeted with a wave of appreciation and Shaw, regardless of his injury concerns, is a fantastic player when he is fit.\\n\\nThe prospect of those two operating either side of De Ligt in a back-three would offer United something completely different to what was on show at Ipswich, and Amorim would be well within his rights to test the water with that approach.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

After playing as a right-back, a left-back and as an attacking-midfielder under former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager Erik ten Hag, his successor, Ruben Amorim, deployed him as a right-sided centre-back for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nSetting up with the 3-4-3 formation that had been religiously analysed ever since succeeding Ten Hag on November 1, the former Sporting Lisbon boss tasked [Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) with operating on the right side of the back-three. He was joined in the defence by [Matthijs de Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nOf that rearguard, only De Ligt will be considered as a staple in United's first-choice backline once everyone is fit and available. The general expectation is that once Amorim has overseen a reduction in the size of the current injury list, De Ligt will be joined in defence by fellow summer signing [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) and Lisandro Martinez.\\n\\nYoro was not included in the matchday squad at Portman Road, with United continuing to monitor his recovery from a fractured metatarsal carefully, and Martinez missed out due to a back injury. With Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof also missing, Amorim had no choice but to make do with what he had available.\\n\\nHowever, as reported by the _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-takes-decision-leny-30417554)_ last week, Yoro is understood to be on the cusp of making his competitive debut for United. It is possible he could be awarded it this week, either against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night or when Everton visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nYoro was United's statement signing of the summer, being signed from Lille in a deal initially worth £52.2million. He was on Real Madrid's radar but yet United convinced him to move to Old Trafford.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Leny Yoro smiles for the camera as he is pictured in training at Carrington.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30456869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185450759.jpg)\\n\\nLeny Yoro could soon make his competitive debut for Manchester United. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe feeling is he will soon occupy the right-sided centre-back berth Mazraoui held against Ipswich. Once Martinez is back, he should join Yoro and De Ligt in making up United's first-choice back-three.\\n\\nHowever, Martinez's return is understood not to be imminent, opening up a window of opportunity for someone else to stake a claim for the left-sided centre-back berth. That someone could be [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw).\\n\\nA whopping 280 days after he made his last United appearance, the England international made his long-awaited comeback against Ipswich, appearing as a second half substitute. He slotted into the left-sided centre-back role after replacing Evans.\\n\\nShaw has experience of playing centrally for United, being tasked with playing as a left-sided centre-back several times by Ten Hag during the 2022/23 season. He admitted after a 1-0 win over Wolves on New Year's Eve in 2022 that he was \\\"really enjoying\\\" the responsibility.\\n\\nAfter so long out, United's primary mission has to be managing Shaw's load carefully and keeping him out of the treatment room. They cannot afford to push him too quickly.\\n\\nBut if he is deemed fit enough to start for United at any point within the next week or so, he is a credible option to start in the left-sided centre-back berth. He has the ball-playing ability to play in a central area and he is defensively sound.\\n\\nOf course, Martinez should be reinstated as United's chief left-sided centre-back once he recovers from his current injury, but Shaw is a solid option to compete with him and provide rotation.\\n\\nThe prospect of Yoro debuting in the coming days and Shaw being deemed fit enough to start will provide United with two very welcomed boosts. Yoro's addition to the squad in July was greeted with a wave of appreciation and Shaw, regardless of his injury concerns, is a fantastic player when he is fit.\\n\\nThe prospect of those two operating either side of De Ligt in a back-three would offer United something completely different to what was on show at Ipswich, and Amorim would be well within his rights to test the water with that approach.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

After playing as a right-back, a left-back and as an attacking-midfielder under former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager Erik ten Hag, his successor, Ruben Amorim, deployed him as a right-sided centre-back for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nSetting up with the 3-4-3 formation that had been religiously analysed ever since succeeding Ten Hag on November 1, the former Sporting Lisbon boss tasked [Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) with operating on the right side of the back-three. He was joined in the defence by [Matthijs de Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nOf that rearguard, only De Ligt will be considered as a staple in United's first-choice backline once everyone is fit and available. The general expectation is that once Amorim has overseen a reduction in the size of the current injury list, De Ligt will be joined in defence by fellow summer signing [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) and Lisandro Martinez.\\n\\nYoro was not included in the matchday squad at Portman Road, with United continuing to monitor his recovery from a fractured metatarsal carefully, and Martinez missed out due to a back injury. With Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof also missing, Amorim had no choice but to make do with what he had available.\\n\\nHowever, as reported by the _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-takes-decision-leny-30417554)_ last week, Yoro is understood to be on the cusp of making his competitive debut for United. It is possible he could be awarded it this week, either against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night or when Everton visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nYoro was United's statement signing of the summer, being signed from Lille in a deal initially worth £52.2million. He was on Real Madrid's radar but yet United convinced him to move to Old Trafford.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Leny Yoro smiles for the camera as he is pictured in training at Carrington.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30456869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185450759.jpg)\\n\\nLeny Yoro could soon make his competitive debut for Manchester United. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe feeling is he will soon occupy the right-sided centre-back berth Mazraoui held against Ipswich. Once Martinez is back, he should join Yoro and De Ligt in making up United's first-choice back-three.\\n\\nHowever, Martinez's return is understood not to be imminent, opening up a window of opportunity for someone else to stake a claim for the left-sided centre-back berth. That someone could be [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw).\\n\\nA whopping 280 days after he made his last United appearance, the England international made his long-awaited comeback against Ipswich, appearing as a second half substitute. He slotted into the left-sided centre-back role after replacing Evans.\\n\\nShaw has experience of playing centrally for United, being tasked with playing as a left-sided centre-back several times by Ten Hag during the 2022/23 season. He admitted after a 1-0 win over Wolves on New Year's Eve in 2022 that he was \\\"really enjoying\\\" the responsibility.\\n\\nAfter so long out, United's primary mission has to be managing Shaw's load carefully and keeping him out of the treatment room. They cannot afford to push him too quickly.\\n\\nBut if he is deemed fit enough to start for United at any point within the next week or so, he is a credible option to start in the left-sided centre-back berth. He has the ball-playing ability to play in a central area and he is defensively sound.\\n\\nOf course, Martinez should be reinstated as United's chief left-sided centre-back once he recovers from his current injury, but Shaw is a solid option to compete with him and provide rotation.\\n\\nThe prospect of Yoro debuting in the coming days and Shaw being deemed fit enough to start will provide United with two very welcomed boosts. Yoro's addition to the squad in July was greeted with a wave of appreciation and Shaw, regardless of his injury concerns, is a fantastic player when he is fit.\\n\\nThe prospect of those two operating either side of De Ligt in a back-three would offer United something completely different to what was on show at Ipswich, and Amorim would be well within his rights to test the water with that approach.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

[Jamie Redknapp](https://www.sportbible.com/jamie-redknapp), meanwhile, was heard telling the group to \\\"just leave it\\\".\\n\\nNow, season ticket holder Neil Finbow, 55, has given a further insight into the row after standing right next to the former Manchester United captain as the incident played out.\\n\\n\\\"It was the guy in the middle's comments that got him, I think,\\\" Finbow told [**The Mirror**](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ipswich-fan-roy-keane-manutd-34181330). \\\"He was going on about his time when he was manager, how he treated his kids.\\\"\\n\\nRoy Keane goes on incredible parking rant\\n\\nCredit: The Overlap & Sky Bet\\n\\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 25 secondsVolume 90%\\n\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\n\\nKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabled\\n\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\n\\nPlay/PauseSPACE\\n\\nIncrease Volume↑\\n\\nDecrease Volume↓\\n\\nSeek Forward→\\n\\nSeek Backward←\\n\\nCaptions On/Offc\\n\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\\n\\nMute/Unmutem\\n\\nDecrease Caption Size\\\\-\\n\\nIncrease Caption Size\\\\+ or =\\n\\nSeek %0-9\\n\\nNext Up\\n\\nRoy Keane leaves The Overlap panel in stitches with comment to Jill Scott\\n\\n01:20\\n\\nAuto718p480p320p\\n\\nLive\\n\\n00:00\\n\\n01:25\\n\\n01:25\\n\\nMore Videos\\n\\n01:20\\n\\nRoy Keane leaves The Overlap panel in stitches with comment to Jill Scott\\n\\n01:04\\n\\nRoy Keane trolls Gary Neville over Sir Alex Ferguson\\n\\n01:08\\n\\nDeclan Rice gives insight into how Mikel Arteta likes to utilise the roles of No.6 and No.8 at Arsenal.\\n\\n01:00\\n\\nJake Paul involved in altercation with Neeraj Goyat\\n\\n03:15\\n\\nSunday League player takes on ex-Premier League pros in 10-a-side game\\n\\n01:23\\n\\nAntony's reaction after being told to play left-back for Man Utd vs. Liverpool\\n\\nClose\\n\\nFinbow continued: \\\"I will sort of defend [Roy Keane](https://www.sportbible.com/roy-keane) here as well, because it may be that the comment 'I'll see you in the car park' is to talk to the guy rather than take him out, so it can be misconstrued. I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"The guy had an issue, when \\\\[Keane\\\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that. So obviously that's been pent-up.\\\"\\n\\nHe added: \\\"I don't have any regrets \\\\[about going down the front\\\\]. It's pent-up anger. No swear words came out of my mouth, I just said 'you're a better pundit than you are a manager'.\\\"\\n\\nSky Sports will reportedly investigate the incident to see if any action is needed, while Finbow admits he is concerned about the future of his season ticket.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone I sit with knows what I'm like,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm in the family bit there, I've been there for years.

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\\n\\n\\\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\\n\\n\\\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 1: Image credit: Sky Sports/X](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0542222d6dee7723/67458635803d5c87b49cea3c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_08.11.18.png)\\n\\nImage credit: Sky Sports/X\\n\\nHe added: \\\"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\\n\\n\\\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim added: \\\"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nThoughts on Amorim's first game in charge as United manager?

For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.\\n\\n\\\"But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there's a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don't drop back.\\n\\n\\\"There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. The big problem is - is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n![Image 2: Image credit: Sky Sports/X](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt0542222d6dee7723/67458635803d5c87b49cea3c/Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_08.11.18.png)\\n\\nImage credit: Sky Sports/X\\n\\nHe added: \\\"We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.\\\"\\n\\nSpeaking after the game against Ipswich, Amorim admitted that his team struggled to properly adapt to his new formation, although he singled out one of his defenders for praise.\\n\\n\\\"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better. We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim added: \\\"I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\\\"\\n\\nThoughts on Amorim's first game in charge as United manager?

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Most of those left in the summer or autumn. The first‑quarter results for the period ending 30 September 2024 may also take in related fees for auditors and other payments.\\n\\nA statement in the accounts said: “Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £8.6m. This comprises costs incurred in relation to the restructuring of the Group’s operations, including the redundancy scheme implemented in the first quarter of financial year 2025. Exceptional items in the prior year quarter were £nil.”\\n\\nUnited’s total debt is now £714m due to non-current borrowings of £481.7m and current borrowings of £232.3m. The latter has risen £36.5m from June’s end-of-year accounts because of the club’s revolving credit ­facility, which offers access to short-term finance and, it is understood, fluctuates during the year.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/manchester-united-spent-8m-sacking-staff-in-jim-ratcliffe-cost-cutting-drive#EmailSignup-skip-link-4)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nUnited’s summer transfer spend of approximately £200m on Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte will represent a sizeable proportion of the £195.8m rise. The figure is expected to be reduced by a significant amount during the season due to sponsorship income, season tickets, broadcast revenues and other sources.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\\n\\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\\n\\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\\n\\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s [1-1 draw at Ipswich](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report). Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\\n\\n\\\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\\n\\n![Image 1: Ruben Amorim watches on from the sideline during Man Utd's 1-1 draw with Ipswich (Image: Getty)](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltd251eccabd89b5ee/67442a273b4e9ee9027080dc/Ruben-Amorim-Man-Utd-Ipswich.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim watches on from the sideline during Man Utd's 1-1 draw with Ipswich (Image: Getty)\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Ten talking points from the weekend football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ipswich Town](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswichtown)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Southampton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton)\\n*   [Arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal)\\n*   [features](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=PremierLeague:10talkingpointsfromtheweekend%E2%80%99saction&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2024%2Fnov%2F25%2Fpremier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action&type=article&internalpagecode=football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nComments (…)\\n------------\\n\\n[Sign in](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dsignin_to_comment) or [create your Guardian account](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dregister_to_comment) to join the discussion\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-11-25T08:00:36.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":4379}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\",\"description\":\"Amad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\",\"content\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n===============\\n                                                                          \\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)\\n\\n![Image 2: Dejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840cfe382b44d072bebc725833788993c800c480/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\nDejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan.

As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 5: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 6: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 5: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 6: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 9: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 10: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

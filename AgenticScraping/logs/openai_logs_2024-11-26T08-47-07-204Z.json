Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n6.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were back.\\n\\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for [Kieran McKenna's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kieran-mckenna) team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ed Sheeran breaks silence on Ruben Amorim exchange after Man United backlash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ed-sheeran-breaks-silence-ruben-30446892)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United news LIVE: £50m transfer talk 'intensifies' as Van Nistelrooy update emerges](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\nThose improvements never came and [it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-ipswich-score-30419615). But that may not be a bad thing.\\n\\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\\n\\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\\n\\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\\n\\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit [such as Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842), or just coming back from long layoffs like [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw). And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\\n\\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine. No manager can fix that after just a few days. Amorim will hope that expectation levels have dropped and he can now focus on the long road to getting United back to the top again.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30450513#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford)\\n*   [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw)\\n*   [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\\n\\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\\n\\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\\n\\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and [interest Geovany Quenda](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/geovany-quenda-transfer-latest-man-30420012) are out of the question.\\n\\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day.

Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\\n\\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing.\\n\\n> \\\"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\\\" he told BBC Sport. \\\"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\\n\\n> \\\"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\\n> \\n> \\\"As for who Ugarte will have alongside him, well, it will probably be someone who is not at the club at the moment. There is going to have to be activity in the next couple of transfer windows for them to get the type of player Amorim requires.\\\"\\n\\n![Image 2](internal:/article/30426263)\\n\\n*   Share\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n\\n*   [Comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382#comments-wrapper \\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\n08:03Bruna Reis\\n\\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\\n\\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\\n\\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter are also keen on securing the striker's services.

On Sunday, Leicester announced Cooper's departure from the King Power Stadium after securing only two victories in his 12-game tenure, with the club choosing to move forward following Saturday's loss to [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc).\\n\\nThe incoming manager will take over a team currently positioned 16th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and without a win in four games. Van Nistelrooy, who recently enjoyed two triumphs over the Foxes during his temporary stint at the helm of United, is now tipped to replace Cooper.\\n\\n[The Coventry City position, which remains vacant following the dismissal of Mark Robins, was one that Van Nistelrooy was reportedly considered for.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30433486) Former Chelsea and Everton boss Frank Lampard was also in the frame for that role and now appears to be the frontrunner to take charge at the CBS Arena.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United player ratings as Andre Onana good but three get 4/10 vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Roy Keane asks Ruben Amorim to change one thing after 45 minutes as Man United manager](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-asks-ruben-amorim-30441479)**\\n\\nIt's since been suggested that United legend Van Nistelrooy has been waiting for a chance to manage a top-flight team, with several managers, including those at Crystal Palace, Wolves and Southampton, under severe pressure.\\n\\nTherefore, it's likely that Van Nistelrooy will stay in England and aim to return to a full managerial role, making him a possible contender should City consider replacing Cooper with the Dutchman. Van Nistelrooy could reunite with United in March, with Leicester hosting the Reds on the 15th of that month.\\n\\nHowever, a return to former club Hamburger SV could also be on the table. According to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is on the list of possible replacements for Steffen Baumgart at the Bundesliga 2 club and has already been discussed internally.

According to Turkish outlet [Fotomac](https://www.fotomac.com.tr/fenerbahce/2024/11/21/fenerbahceden-dunyayi-sarsacak-ronaldo-hamlesi-iste-cilgin-plan?paging=10) last week, [Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe report claimed that the Turkish side's director of football, Mario Branco, opened talks with the Portuguese talisman and his agent, Jorge Mendes. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\\\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\\\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \\\"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\\\"\\n\\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\\n\\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['Be amazed' - Ruben Amorim has proven Manchester United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['Be amazed' - Ruben Amorim has proven Manchester United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['Be amazed' - Ruben Amorim has proven Manchester United critic wrong once and could do so again](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

[More info](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/privacy-notice)\\n\\n[Join us on WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IG57qlIoDZM56XwrenyELG)\\n\\nRobbie Savage has called on Ruben Amorim to reposition Alejandro Garnacho as wing-back in his new-look [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) side.\\n\\nGarnacho was named as one of two attacking midfielders in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road, in what was a change to the wide right and left positions he had become accustomed to under Erik ten Hag.\\n\\nHowever, Savage believes the 20-year-old would be better suited to one of the wingback roles in the 3-4-2-1 system the Portuguese tactician is trying to implement at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, Savage said: \\\"I don’t think Ruben Amorim’s system suits Alejandro Garnacho. He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 3: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Ten talking points from the weekend football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/ten-talking-points-weekend-action)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ipswich Town](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswichtown)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Southampton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton)\\n*   [Arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/arsenal)\\n*   [features](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=PremierLeague:10talkingpointsfromtheweekend%E2%80%99saction&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2024%2Fnov%2F25%2Fpremier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action&type=article&internalpagecode=football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nComments (…)\\n------------\\n\\n[Sign in](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dsignin_to_comment) or [create your Guardian account](https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?INTCMP=DOTCOM_COMMENTS_SIGNIN&componentEventParams=componentType%3Didentityauthentication%26componentId%3Dregister_to_comment) to join the discussion\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-11-25T08:00:36.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":4379}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\",\"description\":\"Amad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\",\"content\":\"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action | Premier League | The Guardian\\n=============== \\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#navigation)\\n\\n![Image 2: Dejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840cfe382b44d072bebc725833788993c800c480/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\nDejan Kulusevski of Tottenham, Brighton's Danny Welbeck celebrates with João Pedro and Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 3: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 4: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 7: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 8: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14. The point took them up a place to 12th in the table, having won only a third of their 12 league matches so far.\n\nWith the January transfer window just around the corner, Amorim may have a limited budget to spend after a heavy spending in the summer. However, Amorim has vowed not to buy any of his former players at Sporting CP in the new year, meaning moves for Viktor Gyokeres and interest Geovany Quenda are out of the question.\n\nWith that said, MEN Sport will keep you covered with the transfer latest throughout the day. So stay up to date with all of the latest Manchester United news in our live blog below.\n\n08:24 Bruna Reis\n\n### Kobbie Mainoo theory\n\nDanny Murphy has suggested that Kobbie Mainoo could have no future at Manchester United following the arrival of Ruben Amorim.\n\nMainoo returned to the matchday squad for Ipswich Town but wasn't among the five substitutes brought on by Amorim. Manuel Ugarte meanwhile, featured off the bench after reuniting with Amorim.\n\nMurphy believes Amorim's long-term vision for the midfield double pivot in his 3-4-3 system will involve Ugarte and a new signing.\n\n> \"To play that role well, United's midfielders will need to be more than just mobile, too,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They will both have to love the defensive side of the game and be able to spot danger and then be fast enough to stop it. In the long run, I think Manuel Ugarte will be one of them.\n\n> \"He needs a run of games to get his sharpness back, but we have seen glimpses of how good he is, for example, in the Europa League against Fenerbahce last month, and he has flourished under Amorim at Sporting before.\n\n08:03 Bruna Reis\n\n### Joshua Zirkzee interest\n\nCaught Offside reports Aston Villa are the latest team to join the list of Zirkzee’s admirers.\n\nHowever, they are set to face stiff competition from Serie A, with Juventus, Milan, Napoli, and Inter also keen on securing the striker's services. It's said that Juve is the 'ideal destination' for the Dutch as he would have the opportunity to reunite with his former manager Thiago Motta.\n\n07:46 Bruna Reis\n\n### Ruben Amorim wish\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford.\n\nThe article claims that United will face competition from Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande. It has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n07:42 Bruna Reis\n\n### Rayan Ait-Nouri 'interest'\n\nThe Sun reports Wolves' Rayan Ait-Nouri is 'high on the wishlist' of Ruben Amorim.\n\nThe Portuguese manager is said to want to reinforce his options given Luke Shaw's injury record. There is a possibility that Shaw could also eventually move into the back-three once Amorim fully instills his 3-4-3 system at the club.\n\nAit-Nouri, an attacking wing-back, is believed to tick all of the boxes for Amorim and the style of football he likes to play. He has also been linked with a move to Liverpool.\n\n07:39 Bruna Reis\n\n### Geovany Quenda 'approach'\n\nPortuguese news outlet A Bola claims Man United have intensified their interest in signing Geovany Quenda ahead of the transfer window.\n\nThe report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach. It has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager.\n\nThe 17-year-old forward has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\n\n07:29 Bruna Reis\n\n### Good morning Reds fans!\n\nHello and welcome to our Man United live blog.\n\nWe will keep you up to date with all things United throughout the day.\n\n22:57 Jack Flintham\n\n### Ex-United men in the running for Premier League return\n\nWhile United fans were focused on Amorim's debut, Leicester City were making the decision to part ways with Steve Cooper.\n\nThe Foxes lost 2-1 to Chelsea at the weekend and sit 16th in the Premier League table - just a solitary point above the drop zone.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a number of ex-United men are being linked with the vacancy at the King Power Stadium.\n\nAccording to bet365, they include;\n\n* Ruud van Nistelrooy - 11/4\n* David Moyes - 5/1\n* Michael Carrick - 10/1\n* Mark Robins - 20/1\n* Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - 50/1\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

On Sunday, Leicester announced Cooper's departure from the King Power Stadium after securing only two victories in his 12-game tenure, with the club choosing to move forward following Saturday's loss to Chelsea.\n\nThe incoming manager will take over a team currently positioned 16th in the Premier League and without a win in four games. Van Nistelrooy, who recently enjoyed two triumphs over the Foxes during his temporary stint at the helm of United, is now tipped to replace Cooper.\n\nIt's since been suggested that United legend Van Nistelrooy has been waiting for a chance to manage a top-flight team, with several managers, including those at Crystal Palace, Wolves and Southampton, under severe pressure.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that Van Nistelrooy will stay in England and aim to return to a full managerial role, making him a possible contender should City consider replacing Cooper with the Dutchman. Van Nistelrooy could reunite with United in March, with Leicester hosting the Reds on the 15th of that month.\n\nHowever, a return to former club Hamburger SV could also be on the table. According to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is on the list of possible replacements for Steffen Baumgart at the Bundesliga 2 club and has already been discussed internally. Following his departure from Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim has been appointed the club's new head coach.\n\nHis first game in charge arrived this past Sunday with a 1-1 Premier League draw played out against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The 39-year-old striker faces an increasingly uncertain future in the Middle East, with his contract at Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of the season.\n\nRonaldo, who was released by Manchester United back in November 2022, has featured 10 times in the Saudi Pro League this season, scoring 10 goals and providing two assists. Playing a key role in Stefano Pioli's side, the Portugal international has fired Al-Nassr to third in the table.\n\nDespite his impressive performances, he's yet to be awarded an extension, making him available on a free transfer in the summer. According to Turkish outlet Fotomac last week, Mourinho contacted Ronaldo about a potential move to Fenerbahçe.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the weekend, the former United boss was quizzed on the reports – which he described as 'ridiculous'.\n\n\"News about Cristiano Ronaldo to Fenerbahce are ridiculous,\" said Mourinho, who preceded to make his fellow countryman an offer. \"Cristiano might come to Istanbul to eat because it's right in the middle of the road between Saudi and Portugal. Or maybe he'll come see his old friend Jose, we can eat at my hotel.\"\n\nFrom January, foreign clubs will be eligible to open pre-contract talks with Ronaldo over a free transfer in the summer – unless he signs a new deal beforehand. If the United legend doesn't pen an extension, the Saudi Pro League outfit will be forced to make a difficult call.\n\nAl-Nassr will have to consider whether they'd rather risk losing Ronaldo for free or cut their losses and cash in during the upcoming transfer window. While the five-time Ballon d'Or winner have been linked with a move, he's recently suggested that he could soon hang up his boots.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Portugal's 5-1 win over Poland, as quoted by TNT Sports, Ronaldo said: \"Plan for retirement? If it has to happen, in one or two years. I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon. I really want to enjoy it, as long as I feel motivated, I keep going.\n\n\"The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\"\n\nMourinho managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. They won the LaLiga title in 2011-12 and the Copa del Rey the year before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\"\n\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\n\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the Premier League as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\n\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\n\n\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\n\n\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\n\n\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\n\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich - Tyrone Marshall - Manchester Evening News\n\nThis wasn't the lift-off for the Ruben Amorim era Manchester United had hoped for, but the mitigation for a sometimes disjointed performance is pretty strong.\n\nAmorim introduced a new formation after two training sessions with his full squad and attempted to up the intensity with a group of players who don't yet have the physical capabilities to sustain it for 90 minutes.\n\nHe was also trying to do all of that against a team superbly well-drilled by Kieran McKenna and one that is proving difficult to beat this season. Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.",

Almost like he got caught doing something he shouldn't have, haha.”\n\nA second added: “What a mess so far by LFC. Poor summer window signing a crocked winger and a keeper when we have two of the best.\n\n“Failure to get a midfielder and now on the cusp of losing club legends. No contract will outweigh the cost of replacement and the drop in output. Get it done!”\n\nWith a third saying: “If Mo, Virgil and Trent leave, it’ll be extremely embarrassing and disastrous to FSG. Everything at Liverpool is going through these players. Can’t afford to lose even one of them.”\n\nWhile a fourth exclaimed: “I think Virg knows something might be coming up. No way our captain isn't in on it.”\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After the game, the Portuguese manager emphasised that some problems will take a while to get fixed.\n\nThey did get to the best start possible within 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford, who scored the opener. But United later struggled to maintain a concerted presence in the final third.\n\nThe result means they have yet to score more than one goal in a Premier League game away from home since September 14.

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\n\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\n\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what Manchester United need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\n\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Ipswich. Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

After an exciting 3-2 match between Liverpool and Southampton on Sunday, all all eyes turned to the Portman Road Stadium as Ipswich Town welcomed Amorim to England for his first game as United manager. Despite an early goal from Marcus Rashford, United allowed the hosts back into the game as Omari Hutchinson scored an equaliser that set the final scoreline as 1-1. And in the wake of the match, members of the Portuguese media have spoken out about former Sporting manager Amorim's first match in charge of United. Portuguese outlet Record was not impressed with what they say from Amorim's side on Sunday suggesting that, while two players enjoyed standout performances, Amorim has a lot that he needs to improve at United. Their report stated: \"The goal after just 2 minutes suggested a great performance from Manchester United in Ruben Amorim's debut, but it was short-lived. \"Rashford scored after a great play by Diallo, but the Red Devils, in short, put in a somewhat lacklustre performance against an Ipswich side that was better at various points in the game. \"Onana shone on two occasions in the United goal and Bruno Fernandes was the most clear-cut, but Amorim's team struggled to connect the game and lacked intensity. \"Ultimately, the Portuguese coach has a lot of work ahead of him.\" Sports newspaper A Bola agreed with Record's assessment and were highly critical of United's performance, criticising their lack of speed and unity. They reported: \"The first goal of the Amorim era for the Red Devils came just 80 seconds into the game. \"The worst came later: a shapeless team, slow defence, low pace and rare dangerous chances up front, showing that there is still a lot of work ahead for the Portuguese coach.\" Amorim's next match in the United dugout will be his first at Old Trafford as his side hosts Norwegian club Bodø/Glimt for a Europa League clash on Thursday night. United will then play seven Premier League fixtures in December as part of a busy festive period, the first of which is a home fixture against Everton.",

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\-1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\-6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\-7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\-8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\-8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\-10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\-7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\-15 | 4\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\-1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\-6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\-7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\-8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\-8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\-10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\-7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\-15 | 4\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\n\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | -1 | 15 |\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | -6 | 12 |\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | -7 | 11 |\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | -8 | 10 |\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | -8 | 9 |\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | -10 | 9 |\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | -7 | 8 |\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | -15 | 4\n",

Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n5.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc).\\n\\nThey encountered it in [Erik ten Hag's first window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news), when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \\\"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\\\" Murtough was told.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: ['No way' - Wilcox transfer stance spells bad news for Ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/no-way-jason-wilcox-man-29102331)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ten Hag has hinted at biggest United change this summer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-hinted-biggest-29106572)**\\n\\nThe irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.\\n\\nThat reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for [Casemiro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/casemiro) and Antony a couple of years ago.\\n\\nThis is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.\\n\\nIn time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.\\n\\nUnited will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.\\n\\nWilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.\\n\\nIt's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.\\n\\nThat makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment13](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jason-wilcox-encounter-familiar-manchester-29122231#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['Be amazed' -

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\\n\\n[Analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis)\\n\\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\\n\\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\\n\\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Composite: Getty Images/Reuters\\n\\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action\\n===========================================================\\n\\nAmad Diallo shows versatility, Ethan Nwaneri offers plenty of potential and Danny Welbeck’s role is key for Brighton\\n\\n![Image 7](https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/logos/red-blue-small-banner-faded.svg)![Image 8](https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/logos/red-blue-large-banner-faded.svg)\\n\\nNo billionaire approved this\\n----------------------------\\n\\nHow the Guardian is different\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\n\\nDiallo thrives in unfamiliar role\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nFor the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s.

So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 9: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 10: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

New Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is keen on Wolves' 23-year-old Algeria wing-back Rayan Ait-Nouri. (Sun)\n\n   United are monitoring Wolves' 25-year-old Brazil forward Matheus Cunha, with Tottenham also showing interest. (TBR Football)\n\n   The Red Devils are also interested in Chelsea's Christopher Nkunku but could face competition from Borussia Dortmund for the 27-year-old France forward. (Teamtalk)\n\n   Manchester United have enquired about Sporting's 17-year-old Portugal U21s winger Geovany Quenda, who is valued at 60m euros (£50.1m). (A Bola)\n\n   The Red Devils are targeting a number of strikers, with PSG's 25-year-old France international Randal Kolo Muani and Eintracht Frankfurt's Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, 25, on the club's radar. (Sky Germany)\n\n2.  Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United ended in a 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town. In this week's show, Gaz Drinkwater and Joe McGrath look at who stood out at Portman Road and discuss how United's players took to the new system.\n\n3.  Manchester United's new formation may have to \"evolve into something else\" if they are going to be competitive in the Premier League, says former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy. Amorim used his favoured 3-4-3 formation in his first game in charge.\n\n   \"This league is very, very different than continental leagues. We have only had Chelsea in recent years win playing that system. And, let's be honest, they had Kante and Matic - two wonderful midfielders in the middle of the pitch, plus Costa and Hazard supporting them as well.\"\n\n4.  Ruben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game. However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\n5. Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Sport: \"Not a good result but it is a tough league with high intensity. We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n   \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ruben Amorim is officially the new head coach at Old Trafford and it remains to be seen if any new additions will be made to the squad this winter.\n\nAmorim's time as the club's new boss began on Sunday when United were held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town in the Premier League. The Reds will now prepare to face Bodo/Glimt in the Europa League on Thursday night before returning to top-flight action against Everton next Sunday.\n\nHere, MEN Sport takes a look at some of the latest United transfer news and gossip that have generated headlines over the last 24 hours. United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\n\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet A Bola, the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\n\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future. Elsewhere, United are reportedly interested in signing Quenda's Sporting teammate, Ousmane Diomande.\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. The article claims that United will face competition from Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande.\n\nIt has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.\n\nThey encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.\n\nThe irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.\n\nThat reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.\n\nThis is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.\n\nIn time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.\n\nUnited will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.\n\nWilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.\n\nIt's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.\n\nThat makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

There is no club like this. But in the end, it is not in my hands.\n\n“As I said, it is December, and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end, it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nHe also went on to admit he felt “disappointed” by the situation.\n\nThis prompted Sky Sports’ pundit Carragher to voice how he was in fact, [disappointed at Salah’s timing](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/champions-league/liverpool-mo-salah-contract-jamie-carragher-475131-20241125) given the fact Liverpool face Real Madrid and Manchester City this week.\n\n“I must say, I am very disappointed with Mo Salah,” Carragher said on [Sky Sports’ MNF.](https://x.com/SkySportsPL/status/1861122528883691772)\n\n“\\[With\\] that interview yesterday…Liverpool have got Real Madrid midweek and Manchester City at the weekend – that’s the story for Liverpool right now.\n\n“And Mo Salah, we’re all quite aware…that in the seven years he has been at the football club, he’s stopped in the mixed zone twice, which is his right, which is absolutely fine.\n\n“But he decided to stop for the third time away at Southampton on the back of winning Liverpool the game.”\n\nHowever, Carragher had seemingly given a less harsh view of the situation earlier in the broadcast and gave a considered take on what he felt the issue between both parties is.\n\n\"I think it's pretty obvious what the issue is what Mo Salah feels he's worth, whether that's in financial terms or length of contract is completely different to what Liverpool feel at this moment,\" explained Carragher.\n\n\"I just hope they meet somewhere in the middle at some stage between now and the end of the season, as I'm desperate to see him in a Liverpool shirt next season.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Dyche was known for his long-sleeved white shirt and blue tie. But during a relegation ‘six-pointer’ against Nottingham Forest in April 2024, the Toffees’ boss wore a club tracksuit to the surprise of many. Oddly enough, his side won 2-0. So, the tracksuit stayed. And the coincidence did not stop there as his team went on a fine run of form, beating city rivals Liverpool and Brentford in a six-day period to ensure their Premier League status. \n\nSo maybe there is a method to coach’s rituals after all.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.\n\nThey encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million.

Not in terms of transfer budget anyway.

A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.\n\nThis is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.\n\nIn time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.\n\nUnited will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.\n\nWilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.\n\nIt's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.\n\nThat makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.",

I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

        "article_text": "Arne Slot has bizarre superstition he sticks to every Liverpool matchday to avoid bad luck - Champions League - SPORTbible =============== Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has a ritual he follows on matchdays, according to reports. Slot, 46, took charge of the Reds in June 2024 following Jurgen Klopp’s departure. Given the fact he had come from the Eredivisie, both fans and the British media were unsure how he would take to life as a Premier League boss. But even the most optimistic of Liverpool fans could not have predicted his start to life at Anfield. A Mohamed Salah brace saw the Reds to a 3-2 comeback victory against Southampton at St Mary’s on Sunday. The win meant Slot’s side went eight points clear of second place Manchester City in the Premier League table. They currently sit top of the 36-team Champions League table with a perfect four wins from four games so far this term. Of course, Slot’s tactics, Liverpool’s players and even the Anfield atmosphere could all be contributing factors to their success, but there may be a more alternative reason at play. According to Mail Sport, the Dutchman has a superstition which involves avoiding looking at the clock at exactly 13.13 (1:13 or am) for several years, as he believes the number can mean bad luck. And luckily for Slot, Liverpool don’t have a ‘13’ in their official squad list. But he is not the only football manager to have fairly odd superstitions. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone is thought to be keen on routines which could also pass as superstitions. Guilherme Siqueira, who played for the La Liga outfit from 2014 to 2017, revealed that the Argentine had the same music playlist on the team coach and in the changing room ahead of games. “In recent times, Slot’s Merseyside rival Everton boss Sean Dyche even switched up his choice of clothing on matchday. Dyche was known for his long-sleeved white shirt and blue tie. But during a relegation ‘six-pointer’ against Nottingham Forest in April 2024, the Toffees’ boss wore a club tracksuit to the surprise of many. Oddly enough, his side won 2-0.

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Mo Salah drops Liverpool contract bombshell and fans can't believe it's true - Liverpool - SPORTbible\n===============\n\nLiverpool superstar Mohamed Salah has spoken out about his current contract negotiations with the club, and fans are shocked.\n\nOn Sunday, Liverpool continued their impressive form in the Premier League this season as they came back to beat Southampton 3-2 at St Mary's Stadium.\n\nAs he has been on several occasions this season, Salah was central to Liverpool's success in the match, scoring a brace to equalise and later win the hard-fought match.\n\nHowever, after the match Salah made a huge revelation about his contract negotiations with Liverpool, ahead of his current deal expiring in the summer.\n\nSpeaking after Sunday's win against Southampton, Salah said: \"We are almost in December and I haven't received any offers yet to stay in the club. I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\"",

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\n\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of this decelerating game of semi-football to talk about Ruben Amorim at least realizing the scale of the job he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It would be tempting at the end of this decelerating game of semi-football to talk about Ruben Amorim at least realizing the scale of the job he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.",

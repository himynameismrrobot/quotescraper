Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 37: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

That means in terms of his mentality, and maybe his attitude, a little bit is going to have to change.\\n    \\n    Once he got his goal against [Ipswich](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town), he seemed to settle for it but when you look at how Amorim’s Sporting team's worked with and without the ball, that is something Rashford is will have learn he has to do. It is down to him as an individual to adapt.\\n    \\n    But it is sad. As an outsider looking in, it is sad to see him looking miserable and not looking like he is enjoying playing. When you feel that way you really do not get the best out of yourself.\\n    \\n    I have been there when you are at a club and you do not feel like you want to be there. It is really difficult to pick yourself up and carry on and he seems to be in that moment at United. Maybe it is time for him to move on to get back to his best because unless he changes his mentality a little bit and Amorim can get him working, then I do not see a place for him in the team.\\n    \\n    The manager will certainly want him to play.

That he has taken to a specialised role in a new system with the minimum of fuss will be no surprise to the supporters who have quickly taken the Morrocan to heart at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nMazraoui has only played 19 games for [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), but he's already played four different positions. In just two games, the 27-year-old looks tailor-made for the right centre-back slot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\\n\\nWith United building play in a back three and defending as a four, Mazraoui's versatility to switch between centre-back and right-back is invaluable. Along with Bruno Fernandes, he is the only outfield player to play every minute of Amorim's first two games in charge, and the head coach likes what he sees.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/noussair-mazraoui-doing-what-manchester-30477349)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Rasmus Hojlund responds to Gyokeres comparison and explains new role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/rasmus-hojlund-responds-victor-gyokeres-30476570)**\\n\\n\\\"He’s an incredible player, he’s our future,\\\" Amorim said of Mazraoui after the win against Bodo/Glimt. \\\"He played in different positions, he always looks fresh but we have to be careful. There’s a lot of games but he’s here to stay. This kind of player is what we need.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has looked unflustered in adapting to a new role, and although it has changed how he sees the game, he is enjoying its benefits.\\n\\n“This is the first time. It’s nice. You have to view the game differently because you are not as high up the pitch like when you are the full-back,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"But you get more time on the ball and you must make the most of that in the build-up. There are some different things I have to do but it’s still the same game.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim has road-tested 17 different starters in his first two games in charge, but Mazraoui seems someone set for a long-term role, with the Portuguese describing him as the type of player he needs.\\n\\n“It’s a big compliment to hear the coach say that,\\\" he said. \\\"What can I say? I try my best every day and in every game. I give my all for the team, for the coach and for the supporters.\\n\\n“We are all in this together. It isn’t about one player.”\\n\\nUnited's spending across three summer windows under Erik ten Hag hit more than £600m. Mazraoui was one of the cheaper buys, at an initial £12.8m, with a further £4.2m in add-ons, but he looks like a bargain.\\n\\nSupporters have already taken him to their hearts. His combative style is celebrated on social media and his low-key passion and commitment have won over a fanbase who were disappointed by the team's start to the season.\\n\\nMazraoui underwent minor surgery after complaining of palpitations back in September, but having initially been told he would be sidelined for a few weeks, he ended up not missing a game. That is the kind of commitment that has made him such a popular figure at Old Trafford, although when that was put to him, he was unaware of his status.\\n\\n“To be honest I’ve not seen a lot \\\\[about that\\\\], but it gives me a really good feeling to hear that about the fans. I love the fans and I always say in every interview that I give my all for them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I hope and I think they see that, that I give my all for the badge and for the supporters. Everybody wants to go home with a win and when I can give that to them as a player and as a team that’s what you do it for.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has had a close-up view of Amorim's start to life at Old Trafford, with a draw against Ipswich followed by a victory against Bodo Glimt.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of changes as the head coach instils his 3-4-3 system into a new group of players and although Mazraoui accepts it will take time for everyone to adapt, he is confident in the player's ability to do just that.\\n\\n“I think always when you want to implement a new style of play that isn’t even close to how we played before then no-one can expect us to understand everything the manager has in his mind right from the start,\\\" he said.\\n\\n“So yes, of course, this is going to be a tough time - but come on, we are all top players and we play the game to win. Eventually we will get to wherever the coach wants us to be.\\n\\n“We have unbelievable players. Of course we can adapt and I think we are showing that. We have to get used to the new style, but I don’t think it will take too long.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

That he has taken to a specialised role in a new system with the minimum of fuss will be no surprise to the supporters who have quickly taken the Morrocan to heart at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nMazraoui has only played 19 games for [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), but he's already played four different positions. In just two games, the 27-year-old looks tailor-made for the right centre-back slot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\\n\\nWith United building play in a back three and defending as a four, Mazraoui's versatility to switch between centre-back and right-back is invaluable. Along with Bruno Fernandes, he is the only outfield player to play every minute of Amorim's first two games in charge, and the head coach likes what he sees.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/noussair-mazraoui-doing-what-manchester-30477349)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Rasmus Hojlund responds to Gyokeres comparison and explains new role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/rasmus-hojlund-responds-victor-gyokeres-30476570)**\\n\\n\\\"He’s an incredible player, he’s our future,\\\" Amorim said of Mazraoui after the win against Bodo/Glimt. \\\"He played in different positions, he always looks fresh but we have to be careful. There’s a lot of games but he’s here to stay. This kind of player is what we need.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has looked unflustered in adapting to a new role, and although it has changed how he sees the game, he is enjoying its benefits.\\n\\n“This is the first time. It’s nice. You have to view the game differently because you are not as high up the pitch like when you are the full-back,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"But you get more time on the ball and you must make the most of that in the build-up. There are some different things I have to do but it’s still the same game.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim has road-tested 17 different starters in his first two games in charge, but Mazraoui seems someone set for a long-term role, with the Portuguese describing him as the type of player he needs.\\n\\n“It’s a big compliment to hear the coach say that,\\\" he said. \\\"What can I say? I try my best every day and in every game. I give my all for the team, for the coach and for the supporters.\\n\\n“We are all in this together. It isn’t about one player.”\\n\\nUnited's spending across three summer windows under Erik ten Hag hit more than £600m. Mazraoui was one of the cheaper buys, at an initial £12.8m, with a further £4.2m in add-ons, but he looks like a bargain.\\n\\nSupporters have already taken him to their hearts. His combative style is celebrated on social media and his low-key passion and commitment have won over a fanbase who were disappointed by the team's start to the season.\\n\\nMazraoui underwent minor surgery after complaining of palpitations back in September, but having initially been told he would be sidelined for a few weeks, he ended up not missing a game. That is the kind of commitment that has made him such a popular figure at Old Trafford, although when that was put to him, he was unaware of his status.\\n\\n“To be honest I’ve not seen a lot \\\\[about that\\\\], but it gives me a really good feeling to hear that about the fans. I love the fans and I always say in every interview that I give my all for them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I hope and I think they see that, that I give my all for the badge and for the supporters. Everybody wants to go home with a win and when I can give that to them as a player and as a team that’s what you do it for.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has had a close-up view of Amorim's start to life at Old Trafford, with a draw against Ipswich followed by a victory against Bodo Glimt.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of changes as the head coach instils his 3-4-3 system into a new group of players and although Mazraoui accepts it will take time for everyone to adapt, he is confident in the player's ability to do just that.\\n\\n“I think always when you want to implement a new style of play that isn’t even close to how we played before then no-one can expect us to understand everything the manager has in his mind right from the start,\\\" he said.\\n\\n“So yes, of course, this is going to be a tough time - but come on, we are all top players and we play the game to win. Eventually we will get to wherever the coach wants us to be.\\n\\n“We have unbelievable players. Of course we can adapt and I think we are showing that. We have to get used to the new style, but I don’t think it will take too long.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

That he has taken to a specialised role in a new system with the minimum of fuss will be no surprise to the supporters who have quickly taken the Morrocan to heart at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nMazraoui has only played 19 games for [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), but he's already played four different positions. In just two games, the 27-year-old looks tailor-made for the right centre-back slot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\\n\\nWith United building play in a back three and defending as a four, Mazraoui's versatility to switch between centre-back and right-back is invaluable. Along with Bruno Fernandes, he is the only outfield player to play every minute of Amorim's first two games in charge, and the head coach likes what he sees.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/noussair-mazraoui-doing-what-manchester-30477349)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Rasmus Hojlund responds to Gyokeres comparison and explains new role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/rasmus-hojlund-responds-victor-gyokeres-30476570)**\\n\\n\\\"He’s an incredible player, he’s our future,\\\" Amorim said of Mazraoui after the win against Bodo/Glimt. \\\"He played in different positions, he always looks fresh but we have to be careful. There’s a lot of games but he’s here to stay. This kind of player is what we need.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has looked unflustered in adapting to a new role, and although it has changed how he sees the game, he is enjoying its benefits.\\n\\n“This is the first time. It’s nice. You have to view the game differently because you are not as high up the pitch like when you are the full-back,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"But you get more time on the ball and you must make the most of that in the build-up. There are some different things I have to do but it’s still the same game.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim has road-tested 17 different starters in his first two games in charge, but Mazraoui seems someone set for a long-term role, with the Portuguese describing him as the type of player he needs.\\n\\n“It’s a big compliment to hear the coach say that,\\\" he said. \\\"What can I say? I try my best every day and in every game. I give my all for the team, for the coach and for the supporters.\\n\\n“We are all in this together. It isn’t about one player.”\\n\\nUnited's spending across three summer windows under Erik ten Hag hit more than £600m. Mazraoui was one of the cheaper buys, at an initial £12.8m, with a further £4.2m in add-ons, but he looks like a bargain.\\n\\nSupporters have already taken him to their hearts. His combative style is celebrated on social media and his low-key passion and commitment have won over a fanbase who were disappointed by the team's start to the season.\\n\\nMazraoui underwent minor surgery after complaining of palpitations back in September, but having initially been told he would be sidelined for a few weeks, he ended up not missing a game. That is the kind of commitment that has made him such a popular figure at Old Trafford, although when that was put to him, he was unaware of his status.\\n\\n“To be honest I’ve not seen a lot \\\\[about that\\\\], but it gives me a really good feeling to hear that about the fans. I love the fans and I always say in every interview that I give my all for them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I hope and I think they see that, that I give my all for the badge and for the supporters. Everybody wants to go home with a win and when I can give that to them as a player and as a team that’s what you do it for.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has had a close-up view of Amorim's start to life at Old Trafford, with a draw against Ipswich followed by a victory against Bodo Glimt.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of changes as the head coach instils his 3-4-3 system into a new group of players and although Mazraoui accepts it will take time for everyone to adapt, he is confident in the player's ability to do just that.\\n\\n“I think always when you want to implement a new style of play that isn’t even close to how we played before then no-one can expect us to understand everything the manager has in his mind right from the start,\\\" he said.\\n\\n“So yes, of course, this is going to be a tough time - but come on, we are all top players and we play the game to win. Eventually we will get to wherever the coach wants us to be.\\n\\n“We have unbelievable players. Of course we can adapt and I think we are showing that. We have to get used to the new style, but I don’t think it will take too long.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

That he has taken to a specialised role in a new system with the minimum of fuss will be no surprise to the supporters who have quickly taken the Morrocan to heart at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nMazraoui has only played 19 games for [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), but he's already played four different positions. In just two games, the 27-year-old looks tailor-made for the right centre-back slot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\\n\\nWith United building play in a back three and defending as a four, Mazraoui's versatility to switch between centre-back and right-back is invaluable. Along with Bruno Fernandes, he is the only outfield player to play every minute of Amorim's first two games in charge, and the head coach likes what he sees.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Noussair Mazraoui is doing what Manchester United said he would do](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/noussair-mazraoui-doing-what-manchester-30477349)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Rasmus Hojlund responds to Gyokeres comparison and explains new role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/rasmus-hojlund-responds-victor-gyokeres-30476570)**\\n\\n\\\"He’s an incredible player, he’s our future,\\\" Amorim said of Mazraoui after the win against Bodo/Glimt. \\\"He played in different positions, he always looks fresh but we have to be careful. There’s a lot of games but he’s here to stay. This kind of player is what we need.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has looked unflustered in adapting to a new role, and although it has changed how he sees the game, he is enjoying its benefits.\\n\\n“This is the first time. It’s nice. You have to view the game differently because you are not as high up the pitch like when you are the full-back,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"But you get more time on the ball and you must make the most of that in the build-up. There are some different things I have to do but it’s still the same game.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim has road-tested 17 different starters in his first two games in charge, but Mazraoui seems someone set for a long-term role, with the Portuguese describing him as the type of player he needs.\\n\\n“It’s a big compliment to hear the coach say that,\\\" he said. \\\"What can I say? I try my best every day and in every game. I give my all for the team, for the coach and for the supporters.\\n\\n“We are all in this together. It isn’t about one player.”\\n\\nUnited's spending across three summer windows under Erik ten Hag hit more than £600m. Mazraoui was one of the cheaper buys, at an initial £12.8m, with a further £4.2m in add-ons, but he looks like a bargain.\\n\\nSupporters have already taken him to their hearts. His combative style is celebrated on social media and his low-key passion and commitment have won over a fanbase who were disappointed by the team's start to the season.\\n\\nMazraoui underwent minor surgery after complaining of palpitations back in September, but having initially been told he would be sidelined for a few weeks, he ended up not missing a game. That is the kind of commitment that has made him such a popular figure at Old Trafford, although when that was put to him, he was unaware of his status.\\n\\n“To be honest I’ve not seen a lot \\\\[about that\\\\], but it gives me a really good feeling to hear that about the fans. I love the fans and I always say in every interview that I give my all for them,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I hope and I think they see that, that I give my all for the badge and for the supporters. Everybody wants to go home with a win and when I can give that to them as a player and as a team that’s what you do it for.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui has had a close-up view of Amorim's start to life at Old Trafford, with a draw against Ipswich followed by a victory against Bodo Glimt.\\n\\nThere have been plenty of changes as the head coach instils his 3-4-3 system into a new group of players and although Mazraoui accepts it will take time for everyone to adapt, he is confident in the player's ability to do just that.\\n\\n“I think always when you want to implement a new style of play that isn’t even close to how we played before then no-one can expect us to understand everything the manager has in his mind right from the start,\\\" he said.\\n\\n“So yes, of course, this is going to be a tough time - but come on, we are all top players and we play the game to win. Eventually we will get to wherever the coach wants us to be.\\n\\n“We have unbelievable players. Of course we can adapt and I think we are showing that. We have to get used to the new style, but I don’t think it will take too long.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

United sit 13th and 12th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and European standings respectively.\\n\\nOn Sunday, they welcome Merseyside club Everton to Old Trafford at an earlier time of 1:30pm. Typically, the two Sunday slots for the Premier League are the later times of 2pm and 4:30pm.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [I noticed a Guardiola change which proves City are in crisis](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/noticed-pep-guardiola-change-before-30481810)**\\n\\nWhile an official reason hasn't been given for the change to the earlier kick-off times, in which [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) vs Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham also take place at 1:30pm, it is most likely due to the [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) vs [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) clash taking place at 4pm instead of 4:30pm.\\n\\nThe MEN [has previously reported](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-vs-man-city-4pm-30479620) the decision was made at the request of Merseyside Police in light of supporter trouble in previous meetings between the two teams. Therefore, the earlier games have likely been moved to avoid any crossover of TV coverage, with Chelsea's game against Villa also set to be broadcast on Sky Sports.\\n\\nAmorim will hope his side can gain some ground in the top four chase with a victory over Everton this weekend as they will then travel to face title chasers Arsenal midweek in the Premier League. City meanwhile are desperate to address their slump after they went six games without a win following an unbelievable draw against Feyenoord on Tuesday night.\\n\\n### Sign up to get even more from our Man United coverage\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article22664779.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_cavani.jpg)\\n\\nWe want your views, Reds.

United sit 13th and 12th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and European standings respectively.\\n\\nOn Sunday, they welcome Merseyside club Everton to Old Trafford at an earlier time of 1:30pm.

Therefore, the earlier games have likely been moved to avoid any crossover of TV coverage, with Chelsea's game against Villa also set to be broadcast on Sky Sports.\\n\\nAmorim will hope his side can gain some ground in the top four chase with a victory over Everton this weekend as they will then travel to face title chasers Arsenal midweek in the Premier League.

Typically, the two Sunday slots for the Premier League are the later times of 2pm and 4:30pm.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [I noticed a Guardiola change which proves City are in crisis](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/noticed-pep-guardiola-change-before-30481810)**\\n\\nWhile an official reason hasn't been given for the change to the earlier kick-off times, in which [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) vs Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham also take place at 1:30pm, it is most likely due to the [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) vs [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) clash taking place at 4pm instead of 4:30pm.\\n\\nThe MEN [has previously reported](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-vs-man-city-4pm-30479620) the decision was made at the request of Merseyside Police in light of supporter trouble in previous meetings between the two teams. Therefore, the earlier games have likely been moved to avoid any crossover of TV coverage, with Chelsea's game against Villa also set to be broadcast on Sky Sports.\\n\\nAmorim will hope his side can gain some ground in the top four chase with a victory over Everton this weekend as they will then travel to face title chasers Arsenal midweek in the Premier League. City meanwhile are desperate to address their slump after they went six games without a win following an unbelievable draw against Feyenoord on Tuesday night.\\n\\n### Sign up to get even more from our Man United coverage\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article22664779.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_cavani.jpg)\\n\\nWe want your views, Reds.

At Ipswich Town, [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were on fire in the opening 90 seconds but soon the frailties of the squad rose to the surface with a draw the fair result.\\n\\nOn Thursday night it looked for 20 minutes like it would be a bleak debut for [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) as Bodo/Glimt stunned the hosts with two good goals. But United settled with [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) becoming the hero to secure a big three points in the context of their [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) campaign.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Casemiro reveals how dressing room has reacted to Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casemiro-reveals-how-manchester-united-30486654)**\\n\\nNeither result should have sparked too strong a reaction from supporters. Ultimately, Amorim's reign is still in its infancy so to expect drastic improvements so soon is unrealistic as is being able to draw meaningful conclusions on whether the Portuguese head coach will be a success or not.\\n\\nHowever, that did not stop former Arsenal man Paul Merson venting his opinion on [Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday](https://www.skysports.com/soccer-saturday). \\\"It shocked me how far they are off,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"When they went 1-0 up against Ipswich within one or two minutes, you think then: 'Here we go, they are going to keep the ball and get their confidence up.' You are 1-0 up away from home, within about two or three minutes Ipswich nearly scored and it was like... there is so much work to be done.\\n\\n\\\"My biggest worry out of all of it was the interview after, when he said: 'That's it now, I have never done so many interviews, now I have got to concentrate on the team.' No, you are the manager of one of the biggest clubs in world football, you will do interviews when they ask you to do interviews and you are told to do interviews.\\n\\n\\\"That was the one worry I think they have got to cope with. When you are in Portuguese football, you will do an interview here and there and they wheel along.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30487972.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2152069342.jpg)\\n\\nSky Sports pundit Paul Merson\\n\\n\\\"He will have the press in the palm of his hand because he is winning every week and they will want a bit of him. Now he's got to be keeping them happy at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, it is a culture shock for Amorim adjusting to the demands of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and United but there is no sign at this stage that he is either out of his depth or unable to adjust in the future. [Merson's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-merson) worries would be cause for concern two years into his reign, not two games.\\n\\nWhatever happens on Sunday against Everton, it is important not to jump to conclusions. This is a long-term project not a short-term fix and United fans need not be concerned by teething issues in the team or with the manager.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

At Ipswich Town, [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were on fire in the opening 90 seconds but soon the frailties of the squad rose to the surface with a draw the fair result.\\n\\nOn Thursday night it looked for 20 minutes like it would be a bleak debut for [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) as Bodo/Glimt stunned the hosts with two good goals. But United settled with [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) becoming the hero to secure a big three points in the context of their [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) campaign.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Casemiro reveals how dressing room has reacted to Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casemiro-reveals-how-manchester-united-30486654)**\\n\\nNeither result should have sparked too strong a reaction from supporters. Ultimately, Amorim's reign is still in its infancy so to expect drastic improvements so soon is unrealistic as is being able to draw meaningful conclusions on whether the Portuguese head coach will be a success or not.\\n\\nHowever, that did not stop former Arsenal man Paul Merson venting his opinion on [Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday](https://www.skysports.com/soccer-saturday). \\\"It shocked me how far they are off,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"When they went 1-0 up against Ipswich within one or two minutes, you think then: 'Here we go, they are going to keep the ball and get their confidence up.' You are 1-0 up away from home, within about two or three minutes Ipswich nearly scored and it was like... there is so much work to be done.\\n\\n\\\"My biggest worry out of all of it was the interview after, when he said: 'That's it now, I have never done so many interviews, now I have got to concentrate on the team.' No, you are the manager of one of the biggest clubs in world football, you will do interviews when they ask you to do interviews and you are told to do interviews.\\n\\n\\\"That was the one worry I think they have got to cope with. When you are in Portuguese football, you will do an interview here and there and they wheel along.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30487972.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2152069342.jpg)\\n\\nSky Sports pundit Paul Merson\\n\\n\\\"He will have the press in the palm of his hand because he is winning every week and they will want a bit of him. Now he's got to be keeping them happy at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, it is a culture shock for Amorim adjusting to the demands of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and United but there is no sign at this stage that he is either out of his depth or unable to adjust in the future. [Merson's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-merson) worries would be cause for concern two years into his reign, not two games.\\n\\nWhatever happens on Sunday against Everton, it is important not to jump to conclusions. This is a long-term project not a short-term fix and United fans need not be concerned by teething issues in the team or with the manager.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

At Ipswich Town, [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were on fire in the opening 90 seconds but soon the frailties of the squad rose to the surface with a draw the fair result.\\n\\nOn Thursday night it looked for 20 minutes like it would be a bleak debut for [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) as Bodo/Glimt stunned the hosts with two good goals. But United settled with [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) becoming the hero to secure a big three points in the context of their [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) campaign.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Casemiro reveals how dressing room has reacted to Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casemiro-reveals-how-manchester-united-30486654)**\\n\\nNeither result should have sparked too strong a reaction from supporters. Ultimately, Amorim's reign is still in its infancy so to expect drastic improvements so soon is unrealistic as is being able to draw meaningful conclusions on whether the Portuguese head coach will be a success or not.\\n\\nHowever, that did not stop former Arsenal man Paul Merson venting his opinion on [Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday](https://www.skysports.com/soccer-saturday). \\\"It shocked me how far they are off,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"When they went 1-0 up against Ipswich within one or two minutes, you think then: 'Here we go, they are going to keep the ball and get their confidence up.' You are 1-0 up away from home, within about two or three minutes Ipswich nearly scored and it was like... there is so much work to be done.\\n\\n\\\"My biggest worry out of all of it was the interview after, when he said: 'That's it now, I have never done so many interviews, now I have got to concentrate on the team.' No, you are the manager of one of the biggest clubs in world football, you will do interviews when they ask you to do interviews and you are told to do interviews.\\n\\n\\\"That was the one worry I think they have got to cope with. When you are in Portuguese football, you will do an interview here and there and they wheel along.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30487972.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2152069342.jpg)\\n\\nSky Sports pundit Paul Merson\\n\\n\\\"He will have the press in the palm of his hand because he is winning every week and they will want a bit of him. Now he's got to be keeping them happy at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, it is a culture shock for Amorim adjusting to the demands of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and United but there is no sign at this stage that he is either out of his depth or unable to adjust in the future. [Merson's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-merson) worries would be cause for concern two years into his reign, not two games.\\n\\nWhatever happens on Sunday against Everton, it is important not to jump to conclusions. This is a long-term project not a short-term fix and United fans need not be concerned by teething issues in the team or with the manager.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

At Ipswich Town, [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were on fire in the opening 90 seconds but soon the frailties of the squad rose to the surface with a draw the fair result.\\n\\nOn Thursday night it looked for 20 minutes like it would be a bleak debut for [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) as Bodo/Glimt stunned the hosts with two good goals. But United settled with [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) becoming the hero to secure a big three points in the context of their [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) campaign.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Casemiro reveals how dressing room has reacted to Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/casemiro-reveals-how-manchester-united-30486654)**\\n\\nNeither result should have sparked too strong a reaction from supporters. Ultimately, Amorim's reign is still in its infancy so to expect drastic improvements so soon is unrealistic as is being able to draw meaningful conclusions on whether the Portuguese head coach will be a success or not.\\n\\nHowever, that did not stop former Arsenal man Paul Merson venting his opinion on [Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday](https://www.skysports.com/soccer-saturday). \\\"It shocked me how far they are off,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"When they went 1-0 up against Ipswich within one or two minutes, you think then: 'Here we go, they are going to keep the ball and get their confidence up.' You are 1-0 up away from home, within about two or three minutes Ipswich nearly scored and it was like... there is so much work to be done.\\n\\n\\\"My biggest worry out of all of it was the interview after, when he said: 'That's it now, I have never done so many interviews, now I have got to concentrate on the team.' No, you are the manager of one of the biggest clubs in world football, you will do interviews when they ask you to do interviews and you are told to do interviews.\\n\\n\\\"That was the one worry I think they have got to cope with. When you are in Portuguese football, you will do an interview here and there and they wheel along.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30487972.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2152069342.jpg)\\n\\nSky Sports pundit Paul Merson\\n\\n\\\"He will have the press in the palm of his hand because he is winning every week and they will want a bit of him. Now he's got to be keeping them happy at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, it is a culture shock for Amorim adjusting to the demands of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and United but there is no sign at this stage that he is either out of his depth or unable to adjust in the future. [Merson's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/paul-merson) worries would be cause for concern two years into his reign, not two games.\\n\\nWhatever happens on Sunday against Everton, it is important not to jump to conclusions. This is a long-term project not a short-term fix and United fans need not be concerned by teething issues in the team or with the manager.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Along with being his first match at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), a 3-2 win in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Bode/Glimt gave Amorim his first taste of success in England.\\n\\nAmorim brought along his iconic three-back formation to Manchester. It's been clear that the players are still having to get used to it. However, with all new managers, Amorim will have a list of players that he wants to bring in to suit his tactics.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Liverpool suffer major Premier League title race injury blow ahead of Man City clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-suffer-major-premier-league-30484425)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Why 'Netflix of Football' is a step closer after Premier League clubs make significant decision](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/netflix-football-step-closer-after-30483231)\\n\\nWe have rounded up the six key possible signings that could change the dynamic of Manchester United.\\n\\n### **Geovany Quenda**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old is a player who Amorim adores from his Sporting CP days. Quenda would be following the likes of [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) and [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) if he changes the green and white stripes of Libson for the red of United.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager handed the youngster his debut in August and the wing-back has played every game since. Wing-backs are essential to Amorim's shape as they have the important job to manage the attack down the ring whilst still maintaining their defensive duties.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Geovany Quenda](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30414028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS350813746.jpg)\\n\\nGeovany Quenda could be on his way to Manchester with both United and City believed to be keen (Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe key thing with this potential signing is that Amorim trusts Quenda. Their relationship could look to build into the kind of connection Ronaldo and [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) had. Reports are that the 17-year-old has a £83m release clause in his contract which could be an issue - although the MEN reported on Friday that [United representatives have already met with the player's agent Jorge Mendes ahead of a potential move.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)\\n\\n### **Christopher Nkunku**\\n\\nThe [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) forward is claimed to be a player of interest to United by [TEAMtalk](https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-transfers-rival-dortmund-frustrated-chelsea-ace-perfect-ruben-amorim-signing-sources). The French international hasn't had the easiest start to his time at the Blues. A knee injury had him out of play last season for a good chunk of the year. Now fit and ready, he is still only experiencing a small amount of minutes, mainly appearing in the Conference League.\\n\\nAgain, Nkunku would be an ideal move for Amorim as he has experience playing with a three back during his time at RB Leipzig. Although he is now primarily used a winger, Nkunku has had experience in a centre forward role, a position which Amorim is experimenting with as seen when he put [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) up front against Ipswich, as well as in attacking midfield - a role former United interim boss [Ralf Rangnick previously praised him for being 'one of the best' at.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-sent-clear-53m-30468659)\\n\\nA permanent move away from Chelsea looks like an unlikely scenario, however, a loan move in January could be on the table with the Frenchman unhappy in London.\\n\\n### **Viktor Gyokeres**\\n\\nOne of the hottest strikers on the market, Gyokeres has a fantastic relationship with Amorim already from Sporting. Under the Portuguese boss, the striker managed 16 goals in 11 league games. So not only does the Swedish forward know how to play to Amorim's dynamic, but the boss understands how to get the most out of his forward.\\n\\nIn Amorim's first two games, he has played with two different central strikers in Rashford and [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund). Hojlund has been the most successful, grabbing a brace in the Europa League on Thursday.\\n\\nBringing the Swede into United would put the £100m+ signings of Hojlund and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) in jeopardy, but performances can pay.\\n\\n### **Matheus Cunha**\\n\\nAnother striker is [Wolves](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc)' main man Cunha. The Midlands side have just picked up their season, grabbing their first two wins in a row recently. Now, with manager Gary O'Neil having a further understanding of where gaps may lie, bringing in reinforcements may require big names like Cunha being sold.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Matheus Cunha](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30467415.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186769955.jpg)\\n\\nMatheus Cunha has been linked with a move to Manchester United in the past (Image: Jack Thomas)\\n\\nThe striker had cost Wolves £43m and they will likely be looking at making a profit from the Brazilian. Although Wolves are 17th, Cunha has bagged 7 goals from 12 games, more than the likes of Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka and Luis Diaz.\\n\\nAmorim will be smart enough to not overload his attacking options. Cunha has been known to play in attacking midfield, however, which could hint at a new role for captain Bruno Fernandes if [TBR Football reports](http://iftbrfootballreportsofunited'sinterestinthebrazilianprovetobetrue,/) of United's interest in the Brazilian prove to be true,.\\n\\n### **Rayan Ait-Nouri**\\n\\nIt looks like it could be double Wolves' for Amorim as the Algerian star Ait-Nouri has captured his eye. The defenders contract is set to expire in the summer of 2026 with [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31913903/man-utd-amorim-transfer-wolves-ait-nouri/) claiming that he wants a move away from the club.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager is certainly looking to expand his defensive options, especially those at left-back. The Wolves wing-back has proven himself a force to be reckoned with on the attack, frequently getting into a position to put a ball in the box, something that a player like Hojlund would certainly take advantage of.\\n\\nAn important factor is the fear of relegation for Wolves. Although they have collected a couple of wins recently, they still only sit one spot above relegation thanks to a better goal difference. It's certain that Ait-Nouri would prefer European football to Championship.\\n\\n### **Verdict**\\n\\nAmorim would certainly have some exciting options at his disposal should he pull off a major summer revamp at United. Should that happen, United's starting XI next season could be: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Ait-Nouri; Nkunku, Cunha; Gyokeres.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

Quenda would be following the likes of [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) and [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) if he changes the green and white stripes of Libson for the red of United.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager handed the youngster his debut in August and the wing-back has played every game since. Wing-backs are essential to Amorim's shape as they have the important job to manage the attack down the ring whilst still maintaining their defensive duties.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Geovany Quenda](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30414028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS350813746.jpg)\\n\\nGeovany Quenda could be on his way to Manchester with both United and City believed to be keen (Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe key thing with this potential signing is that Amorim trusts Quenda. Their relationship could look to build into the kind of connection Ronaldo and [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) had. Reports are that the 17-year-old has a £83m release clause in his contract which could be an issue - although the MEN reported on Friday that [United representatives have already met with the player's agent Jorge Mendes ahead of a potential move.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)\\n\\n### **Christopher Nkunku**\\n\\nThe [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) forward is claimed to be a player of interest to United by [TEAMtalk](https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-transfers-rival-dortmund-frustrated-chelsea-ace-perfect-ruben-amorim-signing-sources). The French international hasn't had the easiest start to his time at the Blues. A knee injury had him out of play last season for a good chunk of the year. Now fit and ready, he is still only experiencing a small amount of minutes, mainly appearing in the Conference League.\\n\\nAgain, Nkunku would be an ideal move for Amorim as he has experience playing with a three back during his time at RB Leipzig. Although he is now primarily used a winger, Nkunku has had experience in a centre forward role, a position which Amorim is experimenting with as seen when he put [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) up front against Ipswich, as well as in attacking midfield - a role former United interim boss [Ralf Rangnick previously praised him for being 'one of the best' at.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-sent-clear-53m-30468659)\\n\\nA permanent move away from Chelsea looks like an unlikely scenario, however, a loan move in January could be on the table with the Frenchman unhappy in London.\\n\\n### **Viktor Gyokeres**\\n\\nOne of the hottest strikers on the market, Gyokeres has a fantastic relationship with Amorim already from Sporting. Under the Portuguese boss, the striker managed 16 goals in 11 league games. So not only does the Swedish forward know how to play to Amorim's dynamic, but the boss understands how to get the most out of his forward.\\n\\nIn Amorim's first two games, he has played with two different central strikers in Rashford and [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund). Hojlund has been the most successful, grabbing a brace in the Europa League on Thursday.\\n\\nBringing the Swede into United would put the £100m+ signings of Hojlund and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) in jeopardy, but performances can pay.\\n\\n### **Matheus Cunha**\\n\\nAnother striker is [Wolves](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc)' main man Cunha. The Midlands side have just picked up their season, grabbing their first two wins in a row recently. Now, with manager Gary O'Neil having a further understanding of where gaps may lie, bringing in reinforcements may require big names like Cunha being sold.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Matheus Cunha](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30467415.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186769955.jpg)\\n\\nMatheus Cunha has been linked with a move to Manchester United in the past (Image: Jack Thomas)\\n\\nThe striker had cost Wolves £43m and they will likely be looking at making a profit from the Brazilian. Although Wolves are 17th, Cunha has bagged 7 goals from 12 games, more than the likes of Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka and Luis Diaz.\\n\\nAmorim will be smart enough to not overload his attacking options. Cunha has been known to play in attacking midfield, however, which could hint at a new role for captain Bruno Fernandes if [TBR Football reports](http://iftbrfootballreportsofunited'sinterestinthebrazilianprovetobetrue,/) of United's interest in the Brazilian prove to be true,.\\n\\n### **Rayan Ait-Nouri**\\n\\nIt looks like it could be double Wolves' for Amorim as the Algerian star Ait-Nouri has captured his eye. The defenders contract is set to expire in the summer of 2026 with [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31913903/man-utd-amorim-transfer-wolves-ait-nouri/) claiming that he wants a move away from the club.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager is certainly looking to expand his defensive options, especially those at left-back. The Wolves wing-back has proven himself a force to be reckoned with on the attack, frequently getting into a position to put a ball in the box, something that a player like Hojlund would certainly take advantage of.\\n\\nAn important factor is the fear of relegation for Wolves. Although they have collected a couple of wins recently, they still only sit one spot above relegation thanks to a better goal difference. It's certain that Ait-Nouri would prefer European football to Championship.\\n\\n### **Verdict**\\n\\nAmorim would certainly have some exciting options at his disposal should he pull off a major summer revamp at United. Should that happen, United's starting XI next season could be: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Ait-Nouri; Nkunku, Cunha; Gyokeres.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

Along with being his first match at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), a 3-2 win in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) against Bode/Glimt gave Amorim his first taste of success in England.\\n\\nAmorim brought along his iconic three-back formation to Manchester. It's been clear that the players are still having to get used to it. However, with all new managers, Amorim will have a list of players that he wants to bring in to suit his tactics.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Liverpool suffer major Premier League title race injury blow ahead of Man City clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-suffer-major-premier-league-30484425)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Why 'Netflix of Football' is a step closer after Premier League clubs make significant decision](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/netflix-football-step-closer-after-30483231)\\n\\nWe have rounded up the six key possible signings that could change the dynamic of Manchester United.\\n\\n### **Geovany Quenda**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old is a player who Amorim adores from his Sporting CP days. Quenda would be following the likes of [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) and [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) if he changes the green and white stripes of Libson for the red of United.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager handed the youngster his debut in August and the wing-back has played every game since. Wing-backs are essential to Amorim's shape as they have the important job to manage the attack down the ring whilst still maintaining their defensive duties.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Geovany Quenda](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30414028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS350813746.jpg)\\n\\nGeovany Quenda could be on his way to Manchester with both United and City believed to be keen (Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe key thing with this potential signing is that Amorim trusts Quenda. Their relationship could look to build into the kind of connection Ronaldo and [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) had. Reports are that the 17-year-old has a £83m release clause in his contract which could be an issue - although the MEN reported on Friday that [United representatives have already met with the player's agent Jorge Mendes ahead of a potential move.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)\\n\\n### **Christopher Nkunku**\\n\\nThe [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) forward is claimed to be a player of interest to United by [TEAMtalk](https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-transfers-rival-dortmund-frustrated-chelsea-ace-perfect-ruben-amorim-signing-sources). The French international hasn't had the easiest start to his time at the Blues. A knee injury had him out of play last season for a good chunk of the year. Now fit and ready, he is still only experiencing a small amount of minutes, mainly appearing in the Conference League.\\n\\nAgain, Nkunku would be an ideal move for Amorim as he has experience playing with a three back during his time at RB Leipzig. Although he is now primarily used a winger, Nkunku has had experience in a centre forward role, a position which Amorim is experimenting with as seen when he put [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) up front against Ipswich, as well as in attacking midfield - a role former United interim boss [Ralf Rangnick previously praised him for being 'one of the best' at.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-sent-clear-53m-30468659)\\n\\nA permanent move away from Chelsea looks like an unlikely scenario, however, a loan move in January could be on the table with the Frenchman unhappy in London.\\n\\n### **Viktor Gyokeres**\\n\\nOne of the hottest strikers on the market, Gyokeres has a fantastic relationship with Amorim already from Sporting. Under the Portuguese boss, the striker managed 16 goals in 11 league games. So not only does the Swedish forward know how to play to Amorim's dynamic, but the boss understands how to get the most out of his forward.\\n\\nIn Amorim's first two games, he has played with two different central strikers in Rashford and [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund). Hojlund has been the most successful, grabbing a brace in the Europa League on Thursday.\\n\\nBringing the Swede into United would put the £100m+ signings of Hojlund and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) in jeopardy, but performances can pay.\\n\\n### **Matheus Cunha**\\n\\nAnother striker is [Wolves](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc)' main man Cunha. The Midlands side have just picked up their season, grabbing their first two wins in a row recently. Now, with manager Gary O'Neil having a further understanding of where gaps may lie, bringing in reinforcements may require big names like Cunha being sold.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Matheus Cunha](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30467415.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186769955.jpg)\\n\\nMatheus Cunha has been linked with a move to Manchester United in the past (Image: Jack Thomas)\\n\\nThe striker had cost Wolves £43m and they will likely be looking at making a profit from the Brazilian. Although Wolves are 17th, Cunha has bagged 7 goals from 12 games, more than the likes of Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka and Luis Diaz.\\n\\nAmorim will be smart enough to not overload his attacking options. Cunha has been known to play in attacking midfield, however, which could hint at a new role for captain Bruno Fernandes if [TBR Football reports](http://iftbrfootballreportsofunited'sinterestinthebrazilianprovetobetrue,/) of United's interest in the Brazilian prove to be true,.\\n\\n### **Rayan Ait-Nouri**\\n\\nIt looks like it could be double Wolves' for Amorim as the Algerian star Ait-Nouri has captured his eye. The defenders contract is set to expire in the summer of 2026 with [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31913903/man-utd-amorim-transfer-wolves-ait-nouri/) claiming that he wants a move away from the club.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager is certainly looking to expand his defensive options, especially those at left-back. The Wolves wing-back has proven himself a force to be reckoned with on the attack, frequently getting into a position to put a ball in the box, something that a player like Hojlund would certainly take advantage of.\\n\\nAn important factor is the fear of relegation for Wolves. Although they have collected a couple of wins recently, they still only sit one spot above relegation thanks to a better goal difference. It's certain that Ait-Nouri would prefer European football to Championship.\\n\\n### **Verdict**\\n\\nAmorim would certainly have some exciting options at his disposal should he pull off a major summer revamp at United. Should that happen, United's starting XI next season could be: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Ait-Nouri; Nkunku, Cunha; Gyokeres.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nAmorim brought along his iconic three-back formation to Manchester. It's been clear that the players are still having to get used to it. However, with all new managers, Amorim will have a list of players that he wants to bring in to suit his tactics.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Liverpool suffer major Premier League title race injury blow ahead of Man City clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-suffer-major-premier-league-30484425)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [Why 'Netflix of Football' is a step closer after Premier League clubs make significant decision](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/netflix-football-step-closer-after-30483231)\\n\\nWe have rounded up the six key possible signings that could change the dynamic of Manchester United.\\n\\n### **Geovany Quenda**\\n\\nThe 17-year-old is a player who Amorim adores from his Sporting CP days. Quenda would be following the likes of [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) and [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) if he changes the green and white stripes of Libson for the red of United.\\n\\nThe Portuguese manager handed the youngster his debut in August and the wing-back has played every game since. Wing-backs are essential to Amorim's shape as they have the important job to manage the attack down the ring whilst still maintaining their defensive duties.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 64: Geovany Quenda](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30414028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS350813746.jpg)\\n\\nGeovany Quenda could be on his way to Manchester with both United and City believed to be keen (Image: Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe key thing with this potential signing is that Amorim trusts Quenda. Their relationship could look to build into the kind of connection Ronaldo and [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) had. Reports are that the 17-year-old has a £83m release clause in his contract which could be an issue - although the MEN reported on Friday that [United representatives have already met with the player's agent Jorge Mendes ahead of a potential move.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)\\n\\n### **Christopher Nkunku**\\n\\nThe [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) forward is claimed to be a player of interest to United by [TEAMtalk](https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-transfers-rival-dortmund-frustrated-chelsea-ace-perfect-ruben-amorim-signing-sources). The French international hasn't had the easiest start to his time at the Blues. A knee injury had him out of play last season for a good chunk of the year. Now fit and ready, he is still only experiencing a small amount of minutes, mainly appearing in the Conference League.\\n\\nAgain, Nkunku would be an ideal move for Amorim as he has experience playing with a three back during his time at RB Leipzig. Although he is now primarily used a winger, Nkunku has had experience in a centre forward role, a position which Amorim is experimenting with as seen when he put [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) up front against Ipswich, as well as in attacking midfield - a role former United interim boss [Ralf Rangnick previously praised him for being 'one of the best' at.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-sent-clear-53m-30468659)\\n\\nA permanent move away from Chelsea looks like an unlikely scenario, however, a loan move in January could be on the table with the Frenchman unhappy in London.\\n\\n### **Viktor Gyokeres**\\n\\nOne of the hottest strikers on the market, Gyokeres has a fantastic relationship with Amorim already from Sporting. Under the Portuguese boss, the striker managed 16 goals in 11 league games. So not only does the Swedish forward know how to play to Amorim's dynamic, but the boss understands how to get the most out of his forward.\\n\\nIn Amorim's first two games, he has played with two different central strikers in Rashford and [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund). Hojlund has been the most successful, grabbing a brace in the Europa League on Thursday.\\n\\nBringing the Swede into United would put the £100m+ signings of Hojlund and [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) in jeopardy, but performances can pay.\\n\\n### **Matheus Cunha**\\n\\nAnother striker is [Wolves](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc)' main man Cunha. The Midlands side have just picked up their season, grabbing their first two wins in a row recently. Now, with manager Gary O'Neil having a further understanding of where gaps may lie, bringing in reinforcements may require big names like Cunha being sold.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 65: Matheus Cunha](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30467415.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186769955.jpg)\\n\\nMatheus Cunha has been linked with a move to Manchester United in the past (Image: Jack Thomas)\\n\\nThe striker had cost Wolves £43m and they will likely be looking at making a profit from the Brazilian. Although Wolves are 17th, Cunha has bagged 7 goals from 12 games, more than the likes of Ollie Watkins, Bukayo Saka and Luis Diaz.\\n\\nAmorim will be smart enough to not overload his attacking options. Cunha has been known to play in attacking midfield, however, which could hint at a new role for captain Bruno Fernandes if [TBR Football reports](http://iftbrfootballreportsofunited'sinterestinthebrazilianprovetobetrue,/) of United's interest in the Brazilian prove to be true,.\\n\\n### **Rayan Ait-Nouri**\\n\\nIt looks like it could be double Wolves' for Amorim as the Algerian star Ait-Nouri has captured his eye. The defenders contract is set to expire in the summer of 2026 with [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31913903/man-utd-amorim-transfer-wolves-ait-nouri/) claiming that he wants a move away from the club.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image 66](https://cdn.convrse.media/images/mantis-recommender/mantisLogoNew.png)\\n\\n[![Image 67: Ruben Amorim must include two benched

The Wolves wing-back has proven himself a force to be reckoned with on the attack, frequently getting into a position to put a ball in the box, something that a player like Hojlund would certainly take advantage of.\\n\\nAn important factor is the fear of relegation for Wolves. Although they have collected a couple of wins recently, they still only sit one spot above relegation thanks to a better goal difference. It's certain that Ait-Nouri would prefer European football to Championship.\\n\\n### **Verdict**\\n\\nAmorim would certainly have some exciting options at his disposal should he pull off a major summer revamp at United. Should that happen, United's starting XI next season could be: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Ait-Nouri; Nkunku, Cunha; Gyokeres.\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 114](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\\n\\n[Argyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/wayne-rooney-plymouth-argyle-reaction-9750748) have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \\\"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\\\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \\\"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\\\"\\n\\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \\\"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\\\"\\n\\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \\\"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\\\"\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image 61](https://cdn.convrse.media/images/mantis-recommender/mantisLogoNew.png)\\n\\n[![Image 62:

But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

United recovered from 2-1 down to secure all three points, inspired by a [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) brace.\\n\\nAmorim will now be keen to oversee his first [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) victory as United boss after his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road last weekend finished in a 1-1 draw.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Chido Obi-Martin marks landmark United moment by scoring again for Under-18s](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chido-obi-martin-marks-landmark-30487111)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\nUnited will fancy their chances of getting the better of an Everton side that has won just one of six away league games this season. But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

United recovered from 2-1 down to secure all three points, inspired by a [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) brace.\\n\\nAmorim will now be keen to oversee his first [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) victory as United boss after his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road last weekend finished in a 1-1 draw.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Chido Obi-Martin marks landmark United moment by scoring again for Under-18s](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chido-obi-martin-marks-landmark-30487111)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\nUnited will fancy their chances of getting the better of an Everton side that has won just one of six away league games this season. But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us.

However, he emphasized the necessity of broadcasters: \\\"I don't see D2C \\\\[direct to consumer\\\\] as the future of football. Maybe it's an option you can use in certain markets,\\\" to negotiate better deals from media firms.\\n\\nFurther delving into American sports trends, Godard observed that long-term partnerships are formed between US leagues and broadcasters. He elaborated, saying: \\\"I don't believe the NFL and NBA D2C platforms are a substitute for sales to broadcasters,\\\" highlighting their usefulness as: \\\"They are a nice tool and a way to reach core fans.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [I fired Manchester United to the Treble -

Zinckernagel. Hojlund scored late in the first half to bring United back on level terms and then bagged his second of the game after 50 minutes to make it 3-2.\\n\\nHere are how the players rated at Old Trafford:\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Bodo/Glimt as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-live-30468119)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Why Leny Yoro is not training with United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/leny-yoro-not-training-manchester-30462175)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nWell beaten by Hakon Evjen but the ball went through his legs from Philip Zinckernagel. Flirted with disaster outside his area but scrambled the ball away. 6\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nEnded an uncharacteristically iffy half with a fine cross for Rasmus Hojlund to equalise. Effortlessly switched from centre back to right back in the second half. 7\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nFailed to anticipate the danger after Tyrell Malacia was outsprinted in another cumbersome performance. His place should not be secure in this side. 4\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nWent walkabout for Bodo's second goal on his return from a back injury. Played one fine pass that led to Mason Mount's sighter before his withdrawal. 6\\n\\n**Antony**\\n\\nCrowbarred into the team at right wing back and did not convince, having trained in that position last week. Made way before the hour. 4\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nHad a different partner in fellow Sporting alumni Bruno Fernandes and the balance was not quite right. Still did well to assist Rasmus Hojlund. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nMoved to a deeper role, where he has excelled before, but was unable to replicate that form. Not a particularly effectual evening. 5\\n\\n**Tyrell Malacia**\\n\\nOutpaced for Bodo's second goal in the ultimate endurance test. Overcooked crosses and had to come off at half-time. He did. 3\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nBusy off the ball on his first start in 96 days and hit the crossbar early in the second half. Earned a bullish chest-bump from Amorim after he came off. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nTapped into an open net after 48 seconds and found Fernandes and Mount for some good chances. Missed better chances himself. 6\\n\\n**Rasmus Hojlund**\\n\\nMade the first goal through his pressing and then finished adroitly to equalise just before half-time. Showed predatory instincts to put United ahead. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA spirited second-half performance. 6\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nSlotted in at centre half. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nBack on the right and a threat. 6\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nShot wide. 5\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

The Brazilian, who has been linked with a move to United, has been in fine form this season, scoring seven goals and adding three assists in 12 matches.\\n\\nCunha, 25, has two-and-a-half years on his contract having joined Wolves, initially on loan from Atletico Madrid, in January 2023. However, there has been speculation over his future with United 'monitoring' his situation following his excellent start to the campaign.\\n\\nA number of other teams are expected to be interested in Cunha, but Wolves are trying their best to keep him. According to [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/29/matheus-cunha-is-leading-light-of-wolves-brazilian-strategy/), the West Midlands club are set to initiate talks over improved terms and want to convince him to stay at Molineux long-term.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[Ratcliffe must make a U-turn after United price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kick-teeth-sir-jim-ratcliffe-30475527)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Wonderkid Obi-Martin signs first professional contract](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-wonderkid-chido-obi-30477567)**\\n\\nIt comes as Gary O'Neil addressed Cunha's future in his pre-Bournemouth press conference and claimed that their talisman \\\"definitely won't leave\\\" the club in January. He didn't, however, confirmed whether he might depart in move at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\\"Matheus definitely won't leave in January,\\\" O'Neil said. \\\"Definitely not. Mine and Matheus' relationship and his understanding of what we're trying to do here is exceptionally good.\\n\\n\\\"I don't foresee there being any problems at all in January with Matheus Cunha contract-wise. But I'll leave that to the club. We have a real focus, Matheus included, on tomorrow's game and making sure we're in the best shape to beat Bournemouth, then the contract staff will obviously be handled by the football club.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Cunha has previously spoken about links to United. He said: \\\"You know it’s a real honour to have your name linked to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), one of the biggest clubs in the world. But I’m happy at Wolves. If I’m lucky, I'll play another good season, but the window is open, you never know.\\\"\\n\\nAs for United, Ruben Amorim won his first game as their new head coach on Thursday as they scraped past Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league). Rasmus Hojlund scored twice, while Alejandro Garnacho grabbed the other as United moved up to 12th in the new league format.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-make-matheus-cunha-contract-30483915#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fired-manchester-united-treble-sir-30457787)\\n\\n[Manchester United features](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-features)[I fired Manchester United to the Treble -

The Brazilian, who has been linked with a move to United, has been in fine form this season, scoring seven goals and adding three assists in 12 matches.\\n\\nCunha, 25, has two-and-a-half years on his contract having joined Wolves, initially on loan from Atletico Madrid, in January 2023. However, there has been speculation over his future with United 'monitoring' his situation following his excellent start to the campaign.\\n\\nA number of other teams are expected to be interested in Cunha, but Wolves are trying their best to keep him. According to [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/29/matheus-cunha-is-leading-light-of-wolves-brazilian-strategy/), the West Midlands club are set to initiate talks over improved terms and want to convince him to stay at Molineux long-term.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[Ratcliffe must make a U-turn after United price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kick-teeth-sir-jim-ratcliffe-30475527)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Wonderkid Obi-Martin signs first professional contract](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-wonderkid-chido-obi-30477567)**\\n\\nIt comes as Gary O'Neil addressed Cunha's future in his pre-Bournemouth press conference and claimed that their talisman \\\"definitely won't leave\\\" the club in January. He didn't, however, confirmed whether he might depart in move at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\\"Matheus definitely won't leave in January,\\\" O'Neil said. \\\"Definitely not. Mine and Matheus' relationship and his understanding of what we're trying to do here is exceptionally good.\\n\\n\\\"I don't foresee there being any problems at all in January with Matheus Cunha contract-wise. But I'll leave that to the club. We have a real focus, Matheus included, on tomorrow's game and making sure we're in the best shape to beat Bournemouth, then the contract staff will obviously be handled by the football club.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Cunha has previously spoken about links to United. He said: \\\"You know it’s a real honour to have your name linked to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), one of the biggest clubs in the world.

The Brazilian, who has been linked with a move to United, has been in fine form this season, scoring seven goals and adding three assists in 12 matches.\\n\\nCunha, 25, has two-and-a-half years on his contract having joined Wolves, initially on loan from Atletico Madrid, in January 2023. However, there has been speculation over his future with United 'monitoring' his situation following his excellent start to the campaign.\\n\\nA number of other teams are expected to be interested in Cunha, but Wolves are trying their best to keep him. According to [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/29/matheus-cunha-is-leading-light-of-wolves-brazilian-strategy/), the West Midlands club are set to initiate talks over improved terms and want to convince him to stay at Molineux long-term.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[Ratcliffe must make a U-turn after United price hike](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kick-teeth-sir-jim-ratcliffe-30475527)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Wonderkid Obi-Martin signs first professional contract](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-wonderkid-chido-obi-30477567)**\\n\\nIt comes as Gary O'Neil addressed Cunha's future in his pre-Bournemouth press conference and claimed that their talisman \\\"definitely won't leave\\\" the club in January. He didn't, however, confirmed whether he might depart in move at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\\"Matheus definitely won't leave in January,\\\" O'Neil said. \\\"Definitely not. Mine and Matheus' relationship and his understanding of what we're trying to do here is exceptionally good.\\n\\n\\\"I don't foresee there being any problems at all in January with Matheus Cunha contract-wise. But I'll leave that to the club. We have a real focus, Matheus included, on tomorrow's game and making sure we're in the best shape to beat Bournemouth, then the contract staff will obviously be handled by the football club.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Cunha has previously spoken about links to United. He said: \\\"You know it’s a real honour to have your name linked to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc), one of the biggest clubs in the world. But I’m happy at Wolves. If I’m lucky, I'll play another good season, but the window is open, you never know.\\\"\\n\\nAs for United, Ruben Amorim won his first game as their new head coach on Thursday as they scraped past Bodo/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league). Rasmus Hojlund scored twice, while Alejandro Garnacho grabbed the other as United moved up to 12th in the new league format.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [I fired Manchester United to the Treble - but Sir Alex Ferguson told me I was a failure](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fired-manchester-united-treble-sir-30457787?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United predicted line-up vs Everton as new midfield unleashed and Amad recalled](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-predicted-line-up-30485990?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Get a LEGO set for £3.33 instead of £36 in one-day only Argos Black Friday deal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/lego-set-333-instead-36-30479569?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Mango's sparkly £30 jumper that's 'perfect' for Christmas parties reduced to £1.50](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/mangos-sparkly-30-jumper-thats-30474912?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Man City line-up vs Liverpool predicted as Guardiola left with no option amid Kevin De Bruyne concern](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-line-up-vs-30483266?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-make-matheus-cunha-contract-30483915#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30466622.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-1124727956.jpg)\\n\\nI fired Manchester United to the Treble -

He will have a watching brief for the weekend’s clash against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.\\n\\nHis arrival at Leicester comes after he spent the first part of the season as assistant to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) at United. Van Nistelrooy then took interim charge of the team for four games following the sacking of Ten Hag.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruud van Nistelrooy first words as new job confirmed and Man United reunion date set](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-first-words-30484872)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim's first Man United transfer move could hand Man City millions](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30484565)**\\n\\nIn those games, United won three and drew just one.

Maguire also has a link between the two clubs with the defender playing for Leicester for two seasons before joining United.\\n\\n> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC92PFcBkHX/embed)\\n\\n[Speaking about his appointment at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-first-words-30484872), Van Nistelrooy said: \\\"I’m proud, I’m excited. Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic.\\n\\n\\\"They have great stories about the quality of the people working at the club, the supporters and, of course, the recent history of the club is impressive. I’m excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.\\n\\n\\\"It’s also something I hear a lot about. I can’t wait to find that out, to be part of the Club, in a manager role, which is a big responsibility. I take it very seriously. Also, getting to know everybody, the community and the supporters, I can only imagine what it means to them.

He will have a watching brief for the weekend’s clash against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.\\n\\nHis arrival at Leicester comes after he spent the first part of the season as assistant to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) at United.

Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic.\\n\\n\\\"They have great stories about the quality of the people working at the club, the supporters and, of course, the recent history of the club is impressive. I’m excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.\\n\\n\\\"It’s also something I hear a lot about. I can’t wait to find that out, to be part of the Club, in a manager role, which is a big responsibility. I take it very seriously.

He will have a watching brief for the weekend’s clash against Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.\\n\\nHis arrival at Leicester comes after he spent the first part of the season as assistant to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) at United. Van Nistelrooy then took interim charge of the team for four games following the sacking of Ten Hag.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruud van Nistelrooy first words as new job confirmed and Man United reunion date set](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-first-words-30484872)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim's first Man United transfer move could hand Man City millions](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30484565)**\\n\\nIn those games, United won three and drew just one. Ironically, two of the wins came against Leicester, [a 5-2 victory in the Carabao Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-vs-30265661) and [a 3-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30338793) in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).\\n\\nLeicester made the decision to make a managerial change on Sunday when they parted ways with Steve Cooper. Van Nistelrooy was quickly linked with the role, with confirmation of his appointment coming on Friday night.\\n\\nUnited players were said to be impressed with the Dutchman during his time coaching at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). And two members of the United squad have shown that with their activity on social media.\\n\\nBoth defender [Harry Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) and winger [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) have ‘liked’ Leicester’s official announcement of Van Nistelrooy’s appointment on social media. Maguire also has a link between the two clubs with the defender playing for Leicester for two seasons before joining United.\\n\\n> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC92PFcBkHX/embed)\\n\\n[Speaking about his appointment at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-first-words-30484872), Van Nistelrooy said: \\\"I’m proud, I’m excited. Everybody that I speak to about Leicester City Football Club is enthusiastic.\\n\\n\\\"They have great stories about the quality of the people working at the club, the supporters and, of course, the recent history of the club is impressive. I’m excited to start and to get to know everyone and give everything I can for the football club.\\n\\n\\\"It’s also something I hear a lot about. I can’t wait to find that out, to be part of the Club, in a manager role, which is a big responsibility. I take it very seriously. Also, getting to know everybody, the community and the supporters, I can only imagine what it means to them. I want to feel it.”\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

despite many question marks over the Dutchman’s suitability for the top job at United, was, perhaps, a sign of Ratcliffe wanting to avoid the ‘hire em, fire em’ culture that had maybe been previously seen.

crunched some of the numbers over the past 10 years at United, highlighting that in sacking managers, coaching staff and parting ways with club officials such as Richard Arnold, the club had burned through £86.2m on those exercises alone, and that figure did not include the compensation paid to Newcastle United to acquire the services of sporting director [Dan

a cost of some £2.4m in redundancies related to his departure, while his successor, David Moyes, was sacked a day after the club failed to make the UEFA [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) the following season, meaning he was only entitled to one-year redundancy, which still came in at £4.9m.\\n\\nLouis van

The football taught now is by Ruben Amorim.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) navigated six changes, a half-time substitution, brief switches in formation and a one-goal deficit to secure a first win under Amorim. This United is a work in progress and sterner tests await.\\n\\nThe players had to think on their feet against the underrated Bodo/Glimt, a team that riled Jose Mourinho a few years ago. United will likely encounter more obdurate opponents in unambitious Everton on Sunday in a very different examination.\\n\\nAndre Onana resorted to time-wasting before added time and Amorim, ever present in the technical area, was often anxiously on his haunches. The referee charitably added only three more minutes. Casemiro diced with death outside his area with a handball. Onana punched Patrick Berg's free-kick away.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ratings vs Bodo/Glimt as Hojlund good](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-rasmus-30475897)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Bodo/Glimt as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-live-30468119)**\\n\\nThe 3-4-3 system was not entirely abandoned but United switched to a more conventional, tried and trusted back four without the ball after sieving two goals in the first half. Ironically, they ended the contest without a centre back on the pitch as Casemiro replaced the cumbersome Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nAmorim dicily decided to make all five substitutions before the 70-minute mark. Out of possession, the back four ended up as Noussair Mazraoui, Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot.\\n\\nCasemiro's lax reaction to Dalot's loose pass played Andre Onana into trouble. Bodo's staff in their dugout and the analysts in the press box were up in arms after the ball hit Onana's hand outside the area in the 76th minute.\\n\\nAmorim's maiden victory was made possible by one of his changes. Rasmus Hojlund doubled his tally for the campaign and Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute goal was down to Hojlund's hard yards to leave the Argentine with a vacant net. Hojlund's involvement in all three goals - pressing, technique and instinct - showcased different qualities United need to see more often from their number nine.\\n\\nHojlund received that number over Joshua Zirkzee for several reasons and he is on trial over the next six months to gauge whether a prolific goalscorer-in-making is currently on United's books. This was an uplifting night for the Dane against the Norwegians.\\n\\nAmorim expected a good challenge from Bodo due to their work-rate and Mason Mount was one of the busiest in red. He earned a bullish chest-bump and pat from his coach when he made way. Slowly, Amorim is getting what he wants. This was Mount's first start in 96 days and he acquitted himself promisingly in a position and system he is familiar with from Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Chelsea.\\n\\nDavid Moyes received an undeserved fixed banner on the Stretford End 11 years ago. The 'Bem-vindo a casa Ruben' - welcome home Ruben - tricolor that was unfurled in the stand's first tier is temporary. The 'a casa' was barely readable due to the slanted unveiling.\\n\\nEuropean nights are still relatively low key, even for a United manager or head coach's debut. There was warm, if not rapturous, applause for Amorim upon his emergence.\\n\\nThe United followers were louder 48 seconds into the contest. Amorim barely celebrated Garnacho's goal and instead coolly took a swig from a water bottle on a night many donned thermals inside the ground.\\n\\nGarnacho's goal was his eighth of a decent campaign. He will feel he should have already broken double figures and surpassed his ten-goal haul of last season. There were two more presentable opportunities where he failed to hit the target. Perhaps fortunate to retain his place amid six changes, he still continued his penchant for following up a negative performance with a positive one in under a minute.\\n\\nHojlund merits the credit for forcing the appalling error from goalkeeper Nikita Haikin through pressing. That is something Marcus Rashford seldom offers and Hojlund, for all his shortcomings, is a workaholic who runs himself into the ground.\\n\\nManuel Ugarte was paired with a different midfielder in Bruno Fernandes, relocated to a deeper position. Amorim urged the midfield duo not to become too detached from the back three yet minutes later the gap was too wide when United were brilliantly breached by Hakon Evjen for the equaliser. Onana complained the defensive shield was inadequate and he had a point.\\n\\nThis was Tyrell Malacia's first start in 550 days and it was too soon. It may crush Malacia's confidence that he was outpaced so effortlessly by Philip Zinckernagel as he put Bodo ahead. That was the first true endurance test for Malacia since his recovery from two knee operations and he was patently slower than before he went under the knife.\\n\\nDe Ligt, another Dutch arrival under Erik ten Hag, inexplicably failed to anticipate Zinckernagel's superiority. By the time he slid in, the ball was goalbound. Amorim directed his ire at Lisandro Martinez for going walkabout and leaving Malacia exposed. Amorim reached for the water bottle again and this time had to keep his cool. Or resist kicking it. Malacia made way for Dalot at the interval.\\n\\nBy the 29th minute, Bodo fans were chanting 'Olé'. Antony and Manuel Ugarte irked the United supporters with backward passes. Mazraoui, a hitherto successful signing by Ten Hag, ensured the half-time shrill would not be soundtracked to boos with some nifty footwork and cross for Hojlund to score. He started the second half as he ended the first with another.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The football taught now is by Ruben Amorim.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) navigated six changes, a half-time substitution, brief switches in formation and a one-goal deficit to secure a first win under Amorim. This United is a work in progress and sterner tests await.\\n\\nThe players had to think on their feet against the underrated Bodo/Glimt, a team that riled Jose Mourinho a few years ago. United will likely encounter more obdurate opponents in unambitious Everton on Sunday in a very different examination.\\n\\nAndre Onana resorted to time-wasting before added time and Amorim, ever present in the technical area, was often anxiously on his haunches. The referee charitably added only three more minutes. Casemiro diced with death outside his area with a handball. Onana punched Patrick Berg's free-kick away.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ratings vs Bodo/Glimt as Hojlund good](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-rasmus-30475897)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Bodo/Glimt as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-live-30468119)**\\n\\nThe 3-4-3 system was not entirely abandoned but United switched to a more conventional, tried and trusted back four without the ball after sieving two goals in the first half. Ironically, they ended the contest without a centre back on the pitch as Casemiro replaced the cumbersome Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nAmorim dicily decided to make all five substitutions before the 70-minute mark. Out of possession, the back four ended up as Noussair Mazraoui, Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot.\\n\\nCasemiro's lax reaction to Dalot's loose pass played Andre Onana into trouble. Bodo's staff in their dugout and the analysts in the press box were up in arms after the ball hit Onana's hand outside the area in the 76th minute.\\n\\nAmorim's maiden victory was made possible by one of his changes. Rasmus Hojlund doubled his tally for the campaign and Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute goal was down to Hojlund's hard yards to leave the Argentine with a vacant net. Hojlund's involvement in all three goals - pressing, technique and instinct - showcased different qualities United need to see more often from their number nine.\\n\\nHojlund received that number over Joshua Zirkzee for several reasons and he is on trial over the next six months to gauge whether a prolific goalscorer-in-making is currently on United's books. This was an uplifting night for the Dane against the Norwegians.\\n\\nAmorim expected a good challenge from Bodo due to their work-rate and Mason Mount was one of the busiest in red. He earned a bullish chest-bump and pat from his coach when he made way. Slowly, Amorim is getting what he wants. This was Mount's first start in 96 days and he acquitted himself promisingly in a position and system he is familiar with from Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Chelsea.\\n\\nDavid Moyes received an undeserved fixed banner on the Stretford End 11 years ago. The 'Bem-vindo a casa Ruben' - welcome home Ruben - tricolor that was unfurled in the stand's first tier is temporary. The 'a casa' was barely readable due to the slanted unveiling.\\n\\nEuropean nights are still relatively low key, even for a United manager or head coach's debut. There was warm, if not rapturous, applause for Amorim upon his emergence.\\n\\nThe United followers were louder 48 seconds into the contest. Amorim barely celebrated Garnacho's goal and instead coolly took a swig from a water bottle on a night many donned thermals inside the ground.\\n\\nGarnacho's goal was his eighth of a decent campaign. He will feel he should have already broken double figures and surpassed his ten-goal haul of last season. There were two more presentable opportunities where he failed to hit the target. Perhaps fortunate to retain his place amid six changes, he still continued his penchant for following up a negative performance with a positive one in under a minute.\\n\\nHojlund merits the credit for forcing the appalling error from goalkeeper Nikita Haikin through pressing. That is something Marcus Rashford seldom offers and Hojlund, for all his shortcomings, is a workaholic who runs himself into the ground.\\n\\nManuel Ugarte was paired with a different midfielder in Bruno Fernandes, relocated to a deeper position. Amorim urged the midfield duo not to become too detached from the back three yet minutes later the gap was too wide when United were brilliantly breached by Hakon Evjen for the equaliser. Onana complained the defensive shield was inadequate and he had a point.\\n\\nThis was Tyrell Malacia's first start in 550 days and it was too soon. It may crush Malacia's confidence that he was outpaced so effortlessly by Philip Zinckernagel as he put Bodo ahead. That was the first true endurance test for Malacia since his recovery from two knee operations and he was patently slower than before he went under the knife.\\n\\nDe Ligt, another Dutch arrival under Erik ten Hag, inexplicably failed to anticipate Zinckernagel's superiority. By the time he slid in, the ball was goalbound. Amorim directed his ire at Lisandro Martinez for going walkabout and leaving Malacia exposed. Amorim reached for the water bottle again and this time had to keep his cool. Or resist kicking it. Malacia made way for Dalot at the interval.\\n\\nBy the 29th minute, Bodo fans were chanting 'Olé'. Antony and Manuel Ugarte irked the United supporters with backward passes. Mazraoui, a hitherto successful signing by Ten Hag, ensured the half-time shrill would not be soundtracked to boos with some nifty footwork and cross for Hojlund to score. He started the second half as he ended the first with another.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The football taught now is by Ruben Amorim.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) navigated six changes, a half-time substitution, brief switches in formation and a one-goal deficit to secure a first win under Amorim. This United is a work in progress and sterner tests await.\\n\\nThe players had to think on their feet against the underrated Bodo/Glimt, a team that riled Jose Mourinho a few years ago. United will likely encounter more obdurate opponents in unambitious Everton on Sunday in a very different examination.\\n\\nAndre Onana resorted to time-wasting before added time and Amorim, ever present in the technical area, was often anxiously on his haunches. The referee charitably added only three more minutes. Casemiro diced with death outside his area with a handball. Onana punched Patrick Berg's free-kick away.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ratings vs Bodo/Glimt as Hojlund good](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-rasmus-30475897)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Bodo/Glimt as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-live-30468119)**\\n\\nThe 3-4-3 system was not entirely abandoned but United switched to a more conventional, tried and trusted back four without the ball after sieving two goals in the first half. Ironically, they ended the contest without a centre back on the pitch as Casemiro replaced the cumbersome Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nAmorim dicily decided to make all five substitutions before the 70-minute mark. Out of possession, the back four ended up as Noussair Mazraoui, Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot.\\n\\nCasemiro's lax reaction to Dalot's loose pass played Andre Onana into trouble. Bodo's staff in their dugout and the analysts in the press box were up in arms after the ball hit Onana's hand outside the area in the 76th minute.\\n\\nAmorim's maiden victory was made possible by one of his changes. Rasmus Hojlund doubled his tally for the campaign and Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute goal was down to Hojlund's hard yards to leave the Argentine with a vacant net. Hojlund's involvement in all three goals - pressing, technique and instinct - showcased different qualities United need to see more often from their number nine.\\n\\nHojlund received that number over Joshua Zirkzee for several reasons and he is on trial over the next six months to gauge whether a prolific goalscorer-in-making is currently on United's books. This was an uplifting night for the Dane against the Norwegians.\\n\\nAmorim expected a good challenge from Bodo due to their work-rate and Mason Mount was one of the busiest in red. He earned a bullish chest-bump and pat from his coach when he made way. Slowly, Amorim is getting what he wants. This was Mount's first start in 96 days and he acquitted himself promisingly in a position and system he is familiar with from Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Chelsea.\\n\\nDavid Moyes received an undeserved fixed banner on the Stretford End 11 years ago. The 'Bem-vindo a casa Ruben' - welcome home Ruben - tricolor that was unfurled in the stand's first tier is temporary. The 'a casa' was barely readable due to the slanted unveiling.\\n\\nEuropean nights are still relatively low key, even for a United manager or head coach's debut. There was warm, if not rapturous, applause for Amorim upon his emergence.\\n\\nThe United followers were louder 48 seconds into the contest. Amorim barely celebrated Garnacho's goal and instead coolly took a swig from a water bottle on a night many donned thermals inside the ground.\\n\\nGarnacho's goal was his eighth of a decent campaign. He will feel he should have already broken double figures and surpassed his ten-goal haul of last season. There were two more presentable opportunities where he failed to hit the target. Perhaps fortunate to retain his place amid six changes, he still continued his penchant for following up a negative performance with a positive one in under a minute.\\n\\nHojlund merits the credit for forcing the appalling error from goalkeeper Nikita Haikin through pressing. That is something Marcus Rashford seldom offers and Hojlund, for all his shortcomings, is a workaholic who runs himself into the ground.\\n\\nManuel Ugarte was paired with a different midfielder in Bruno Fernandes, relocated to a deeper position. Amorim urged the midfield duo not to become too detached from the back three yet minutes later the gap was too wide when United were brilliantly breached by Hakon Evjen for the equaliser. Onana complained the defensive shield was inadequate and he had a point.\\n\\nThis was Tyrell Malacia's first start in 550 days and it was too soon. It may crush Malacia's confidence that he was outpaced so effortlessly by Philip Zinckernagel as he put Bodo ahead. That was the first true endurance test for Malacia since his recovery from two knee operations and he was patently slower than before he went under the knife.\\n\\nDe Ligt, another Dutch arrival under Erik ten Hag, inexplicably failed to anticipate Zinckernagel's superiority. By the time he slid in, the ball was goalbound. Amorim directed his ire at Lisandro Martinez for going walkabout and leaving Malacia exposed. Amorim reached for the water bottle again and this time had to keep his cool. Or resist kicking it. Malacia made way for Dalot at the interval.\\n\\nBy the 29th minute, Bodo fans were chanting 'Olé'. Antony and Manuel Ugarte irked the United supporters with backward passes. Mazraoui, a hitherto successful signing by Ten Hag, ensured the half-time shrill would not be soundtracked to boos with some nifty footwork and cross for Hojlund to score. He started the second half as he ended the first with another.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The football taught now is by Ruben Amorim.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) navigated six changes, a half-time substitution, brief switches in formation and a one-goal deficit to secure a first win under Amorim. This United is a work in progress and sterner tests await.\\n\\nThe players had to think on their feet against the underrated Bodo/Glimt, a team that riled Jose Mourinho a few years ago. United will likely encounter more obdurate opponents in unambitious Everton on Sunday in a very different examination.\\n\\nAndre Onana resorted to time-wasting before added time and Amorim, ever present in the technical area, was often anxiously on his haunches. The referee charitably added only three more minutes. Casemiro diced with death outside his area with a handball. Onana punched Patrick Berg's free-kick away.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ratings vs Bodo/Glimt as Hojlund good](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-rasmus-30475897)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Bodo/Glimt as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-live-30468119)**\\n\\nThe 3-4-3 system was not entirely abandoned but United switched to a more conventional, tried and trusted back four without the ball after sieving two goals in the first half. Ironically, they ended the contest without a centre back on the pitch as Casemiro replaced the cumbersome Matthijs de Ligt.\\n\\nAmorim dicily decided to make all five substitutions before the 70-minute mark. Out of possession, the back four ended up as Noussair Mazraoui, Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot.\\n\\nCasemiro's lax reaction to Dalot's loose pass played Andre Onana into trouble. Bodo's staff in their dugout and the analysts in the press box were up in arms after the ball hit Onana's hand outside the area in the 76th minute.\\n\\nAmorim's maiden victory was made possible by one of his changes. Rasmus Hojlund doubled his tally for the campaign and Alejandro Garnacho's first-minute goal was down to Hojlund's hard yards to leave the Argentine with a vacant net. Hojlund's involvement in all three goals - pressing, technique and instinct - showcased different qualities United need to see more often from their number nine.\\n\\nHojlund received that number over Joshua Zirkzee for several reasons and he is on trial over the next six months to gauge whether a prolific goalscorer-in-making is currently on United's books. This was an uplifting night for the Dane against the Norwegians.\\n\\nAmorim expected a good challenge from Bodo due to their work-rate and Mason Mount was one of the busiest in red. He earned a bullish chest-bump and pat from his coach when he made way. Slowly, Amorim is getting what he wants. This was Mount's first start in 96 days and he acquitted himself promisingly in a position and system he is familiar with from Thomas Tuchel's tenure at Chelsea.\\n\\nDavid Moyes received an undeserved fixed banner on the Stretford End 11 years ago. The 'Bem-vindo a casa Ruben' - welcome home Ruben - tricolor that was unfurled in the stand's first tier is temporary. The 'a casa' was barely readable due to the slanted unveiling.\\n\\nEuropean nights are still relatively low key, even for a United manager or head coach's debut. There was warm, if not rapturous, applause for Amorim upon his emergence.\\n\\nThe United followers were louder 48 seconds into the contest. Amorim barely celebrated Garnacho's goal and instead coolly took a swig from a water bottle on a night many donned thermals inside the ground.\\n\\nGarnacho's goal was his eighth of a decent campaign. He will feel he should have already broken double figures and surpassed his ten-goal haul of last season. There were two more presentable opportunities where he failed to hit the target. Perhaps fortunate to retain his place amid six changes, he still continued his penchant for following up a negative performance with a positive one in under a minute.\\n\\nHojlund merits the credit for forcing the appalling error from goalkeeper Nikita Haikin through pressing. That is something Marcus Rashford seldom offers and Hojlund, for all his shortcomings, is a workaholic who runs himself into the ground.\\n\\nManuel Ugarte was paired with a different midfielder in Bruno Fernandes, relocated to a deeper position. Amorim urged the midfield duo not to become too detached from the back three yet minutes later the gap was too wide when United were brilliantly breached by Hakon Evjen for the equaliser. Onana complained the defensive shield was inadequate and he had a point.\\n\\nThis was Tyrell Malacia's first start in 550 days and it was too soon. It may crush Malacia's confidence that he was outpaced so effortlessly by Philip Zinckernagel as he put Bodo ahead. That was the first true endurance test for Malacia since his recovery from two knee operations and he was patently slower than before he went under the knife.\\n\\nDe Ligt, another Dutch arrival under Erik ten Hag, inexplicably failed to anticipate Zinckernagel's superiority. By the time he slid in, the ball was goalbound. Amorim directed his ire at Lisandro Martinez for going walkabout and leaving Malacia exposed. Amorim reached for the water bottle again and this time had to keep his cool. Or resist kicking it. Malacia made way for Dalot at the interval.\\n\\nBy the 29th minute, Bodo fans were chanting 'Olé'. Antony and Manuel Ugarte irked the United supporters with backward passes. Mazraoui, a hitherto successful signing by Ten Hag, ensured the half-time shrill would not be soundtracked to boos with some nifty footwork and cross for Hojlund to score. He started the second half as he ended the first with another.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The club were reluctant to pay compensation for a manager, making him an attractive option.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy previously had a short spell managing PSV Eindhoven, the club where he made his big breakthrough as a player, winning the Dutch Cup in 2023 [before resigning](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/24/ruud-van-nistelrooy-resigns-as-psv-manager-after-talks-over-internal-affairs), citing a lack of support within the club.\\n\\nLeicester are 16th in the table, one point above the relegation zone. The Dutchman’s first game could be at Brentford on Saturday, before matches against West Ham, Brighton, Newcastle and Wolves.\\n\\nLeicester’s players returned to training on Tuesday, led by the first-team coach Ben Dawson, who joined from Newcastle in the summer, after a Christmas party in Copenhagen, where players were filmed dancing at a nightclub in front of a sign that read: “Enzo I miss you.”\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy joined United as an assistant coach in July but was appointed interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag and oversaw four games, winning three, drawing one.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ruud-van-nistelrooy-set-to-succeed-steve-cooper-as-leicester-manager#EmailSignup-skip-link-8)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nTwo of Van Nistelrooy’s wins in the United dugout came against Leicester, with a 5-2 win in the Carabao Cup before a 3-0 league victory in his final match in caretaker charge.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

The club were reluctant to pay compensation for a manager, making him an attractive option.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy previously had a short spell managing PSV Eindhoven, the club where he made his big breakthrough as a player, winning the Dutch Cup in 2023 [before resigning](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/24/ruud-van-nistelrooy-resigns-as-psv-manager-after-talks-over-internal-affairs), citing a lack of support within the club.\\n\\nLeicester are 16th in the table, one point above the relegation zone. The Dutchman’s first game could be at Brentford on Saturday, before matches against West Ham, Brighton, Newcastle and Wolves.\\n\\nLeicester’s players returned to training on Tuesday, led by the first-team coach Ben Dawson, who joined from Newcastle in the summer, after a Christmas party in Copenhagen, where players were filmed dancing at a nightclub in front of a sign that read: “Enzo I miss you.”\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy joined United as an assistant coach in July but was appointed interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag and oversaw four games, winning three, drawing one.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ruud-van-nistelrooy-set-to-succeed-steve-cooper-as-leicester-manager#EmailSignup-skip-link-8)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nTwo of Van Nistelrooy’s wins in the United dugout came against Leicester, with a 5-2 win in the Carabao Cup before a 3-0 league victory in his final match in caretaker charge.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n5.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

One unconvincing draw against an Ipswich side that has already taken points off Aston Villa and Tottenham this season is enough evidence to realise he is wasting his time.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) set his side up in his preferred 3-4-3 system, just as he had said he would do, and that shape helped to deliver a wonderfully crafted first goal after just 81 seconds. The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\\n\\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\\n\\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\\n\\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\\n\\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\\\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \\\"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\\\[N’Golo\\\\] Kante and \\\\[Nemanja\\\\] Matic.\\n\\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\\\[Diego\\\\] Costa up top with \\\\[Eden\\\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\\n\\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\\n\\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\\n\\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\\n\\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\\n\\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\\n\\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

One unconvincing draw against an Ipswich side that has already taken points off Aston Villa and Tottenham this season is enough evidence to realise he is wasting his time.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) set his side up in his preferred 3-4-3 system, just as he had said he would do, and that shape helped to deliver a wonderfully crafted first goal after just 81 seconds. The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\\n\\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\\n\\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\\n\\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\\n\\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\\\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \\\"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\\\[N’Golo\\\\] Kante and \\\\[Nemanja\\\\] Matic.\\n\\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\\\[Diego\\\\] Costa up top with \\\\[Eden\\\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\\n\\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\\n\\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\\n\\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\\n\\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\\n\\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\\n\\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

One unconvincing draw against an Ipswich side that has already taken points off Aston Villa and Tottenham this season is enough evidence to realise he is wasting his time.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) set his side up in his preferred 3-4-3 system, just as he had said he would do, and that shape helped to deliver a wonderfully crafted first goal after just 81 seconds. The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\\n\\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\\n\\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\\n\\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\\n\\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\\\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \\\"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\\\[N’Golo\\\\] Kante and \\\\[Nemanja\\\\] Matic.\\n\\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\\\[Diego\\\\] Costa up top with \\\\[Eden\\\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\\n\\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\\n\\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\\n\\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\\n\\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\\n\\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\\n\\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

One unconvincing draw against an Ipswich side that has already taken points off Aston Villa and Tottenham this season is enough evidence to realise he is wasting his time.\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) set his side up in his preferred 3-4-3 system, just as he had said he would do, and that shape helped to deliver a wonderfully crafted first goal after just 81 seconds. The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\\n\\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\\n\\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\\n\\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\\n\\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\\\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \\\"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\\\[N’Golo\\\\] Kante and \\\\[Nemanja\\\\] Matic.\\n\\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\\\[Diego\\\\] Costa up top with \\\\[Eden\\\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\\n\\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\\n\\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\\n\\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\\n\\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\\n\\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\\n\\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/be-amazed-ruben-amorim-proven-30446457#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Dalot is hugely popular with ordinary staff at Carrington and has the same respect from journalists for answering questions when he doesn't have to.\\n\\nIt takes just a few minutes for a player to provide fans with insight by speaking in the mixed zone and Dalot gets it. \\\"We obviously didn't have a lot of days to put it all together,\\\" said Dalot when he was asked about Ruben Amorim and playing in the new head coach's formation.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [I spotted Amorim copying Guardiola vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spotted-ruben-amorim-copying-pep-30440344)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United player ratings against Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n\\\"But I think we need to give credit to all the players involved and staff, who gave us all the information that we needed to be ready for this game. We now have a couple of days more to keep working on that and look forward to Thursday \\\\[FK Bodø/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\\"\\n\\nDalot praised what Amorim is looking to change and said: \\\"He's made an impact straight away. I think his philosophy and the way he wants to play, I think it suits the standards of the club. The intense football, working hard for the team and we just need to put it in practice now.\\n\\n\\\"He's really demanding. He's exactly what we need for this type of club and that's the standard the club should be, High demanding people, really professional and working hard for the team.\\n\\n\\\"I think that's the clear message he gives us every day. He is really clear. That's what I said, we have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now it will take training sessions and games to put it into practice.\\\"\\n\\nDalot started at left wing-back and revealed the specific instructions he was given. \\\"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for every body and he wants us to have more control of the games,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I feel comfortable, I've played on the left a couple of times now. The system is new for this club but I've played with three centre backs before so I can adapt really quick.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441213.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186651640.jpg)\\n\\nDalot started on the left.\\n\\nSo what did Amorim say in the dressing room at full-time? \\\"We will speak tomorrow, that's what he wants us to do. Recovery and speak tomorrow,\\\" said Dalot with the conversation ending.\\n\\n\\\"We have to focus on Thursday, try to win on Thursday and build from there.\\\" The last question was about Andre Onana's strong performance and Dalot added: \\\"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\\\"\\n\\nOnana has been the standout performer in a difficult start to the season but there is a growing conversation among fans about Dalot's drop off following a consistent campaign.\\n\\nThe Portuguese international has struggled to produce the same standard of displays and some have questioned whether he would benefit from a spell out of the starting side.\\n\\nEarlier this month, a source admitted that Dalot was currently feeling the effects of a gruelling campaign but said he's the type of character to continue to give everything for the team.\\n\\nDalot started 35 games from a possible 38 in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) last season and managed to avoid injury, only being unavailable once through suspension. He made a total of 50 appearances in all competitions and was always in the squad while his teammates dropped like flies.\\n\\nAvailability is the best ability and Dalot's commitment to the club can't be questioned.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Diogo Dalot](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/diogo-dalot)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Dalot is hugely popular with ordinary staff at Carrington and has the same respect from journalists for answering questions when he doesn't have to.\\n\\nIt takes just a few minutes for a player to provide fans with insight by speaking in the mixed zone and Dalot gets it. \\\"We obviously didn't have a lot of days to put it all together,\\\" said Dalot when he was asked about Ruben Amorim and playing in the new head coach's formation.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [I spotted Amorim copying Guardiola vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spotted-ruben-amorim-copying-pep-30440344)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United player ratings against Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n\\\"But I think we need to give credit to all the players involved and staff, who gave us all the information that we needed to be ready for this game. We now have a couple of days more to keep working on that and look forward to Thursday \\\\[FK Bodø/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\\"\\n\\nDalot praised what Amorim is looking to change and said: \\\"He's made an impact straight away. I think his philosophy and the way he wants to play, I think it suits the standards of the club. The intense football, working hard for the team and we just need to put it in practice now.\\n\\n\\\"He's really demanding. He's exactly what we need for this type of club and that's the standard the club should be, High demanding people, really professional and working hard for the team.\\n\\n\\\"I think that's the clear message he gives us every day. He is really clear. That's what I said, we have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now it will take training sessions and games to put it into practice.\\\"\\n\\nDalot started at left wing-back and revealed the specific instructions he was given. \\\"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for every body and he wants us to have more control of the games,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I feel comfortable, I've played on the left a couple of times now. The system is new for this club but I've played with three centre backs before so I can adapt really quick.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441213.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186651640.jpg)\\n\\nDalot started on the left.\\n\\nSo what did Amorim say in the dressing room at full-time? \\\"We will speak tomorrow, that's what he wants us to do. Recovery and speak tomorrow,\\\" said Dalot with the conversation ending.\\n\\n\\\"We have to focus on Thursday, try to win on Thursday and build from there.\\\" The last question was about Andre Onana's strong performance and Dalot added: \\\"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\\\"\\n\\nOnana has been the standout performer in a difficult start to the season but there is a growing conversation among fans about Dalot's drop off following a consistent campaign.\\n\\nThe Portuguese international has struggled to produce the same standard of displays and some have questioned whether he would benefit from a spell out of the starting side.\\n\\nEarlier this month, a source admitted that Dalot was currently feeling the effects of a gruelling campaign but said he's the type of character to continue to give everything for the team.\\n\\nDalot started 35 games from a possible 38 in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) last season and managed to avoid injury, only being unavailable once through suspension. He made a total of 50 appearances in all competitions and was always in the squad while his teammates dropped like flies.\\n\\nAvailability is the best ability and Dalot's commitment to the club can't be questioned.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Diogo Dalot](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/diogo-dalot)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Dalot is hugely popular with ordinary staff at Carrington and has the same respect from journalists for answering questions when he doesn't have to.\\n\\nIt takes just a few minutes for a player to provide fans with insight by speaking in the mixed zone and Dalot gets it. \\\"We obviously didn't have a lot of days to put it all together,\\\" said Dalot when he was asked about Ruben Amorim and playing in the new head coach's formation.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [I spotted Amorim copying Guardiola vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spotted-ruben-amorim-copying-pep-30440344)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United player ratings against Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n\\\"But I think we need to give credit to all the players involved and staff, who gave us all the information that we needed to be ready for this game. We now have a couple of days more to keep working on that and look forward to Thursday \\\\[FK Bodø/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\\"\\n\\nDalot praised what Amorim is looking to change and said: \\\"He's made an impact straight away. I think his philosophy and the way he wants to play, I think it suits the standards of the club. The intense football, working hard for the team and we just need to put it in practice now.\\n\\n\\\"He's really demanding. He's exactly what we need for this type of club and that's the standard the club should be, High demanding people, really professional and working hard for the team.\\n\\n\\\"I think that's the clear message he gives us every day. He is really clear. That's what I said, we have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now it will take training sessions and games to put it into practice.\\\"\\n\\nDalot started at left wing-back and revealed the specific instructions he was given. \\\"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for every body and he wants us to have more control of the games,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I feel comfortable, I've played on the left a couple of times now. The system is new for this club but I've played with three centre backs before so I can adapt really quick.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441213.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186651640.jpg)\\n\\nDalot started on the left.\\n\\nSo what did Amorim say in the dressing room at full-time? \\\"We will speak tomorrow, that's what he wants us to do. Recovery and speak tomorrow,\\\" said Dalot with the conversation ending.\\n\\n\\\"We have to focus on Thursday, try to win on Thursday and build from there.\\\" The last question was about Andre Onana's strong performance and Dalot added: \\\"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\\\"\\n\\nOnana has been the standout performer in a difficult start to the season but there is a growing conversation among fans about Dalot's drop off following a consistent campaign.\\n\\nThe Portuguese international has struggled to produce the same standard of displays and some have questioned whether he would benefit from a spell out of the starting side.\\n\\nEarlier this month, a source admitted that Dalot was currently feeling the effects of a gruelling campaign but said he's the type of character to continue to give everything for the team.\\n\\nDalot started 35 games from a possible 38 in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) last season and managed to avoid injury, only being unavailable once through suspension. He made a total of 50 appearances in all competitions and was always in the squad while his teammates dropped like flies.\\n\\nAvailability is the best ability and Dalot's commitment to the club can't be questioned.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Diogo Dalot](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/diogo-dalot)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Dalot is hugely popular with ordinary staff at Carrington and has the same respect from journalists for answering questions when he doesn't have to.\\n\\nIt takes just a few minutes for a player to provide fans with insight by speaking in the mixed zone and Dalot gets it. \\\"We obviously didn't have a lot of days to put it all together,\\\" said Dalot when he was asked about Ruben Amorim and playing in the new head coach's formation.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [I spotted Amorim copying Guardiola vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spotted-ruben-amorim-copying-pep-30440344)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United player ratings against Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n\\\"But I think we need to give credit to all the players involved and staff, who gave us all the information that we needed to be ready for this game. We now have a couple of days more to keep working on that and look forward to Thursday \\\\[FK Bodø/Glimt in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league).\\\"\\n\\nDalot praised what Amorim is looking to change and said: \\\"He's made an impact straight away. I think his philosophy and the way he wants to play, I think it suits the standards of the club. The intense football, working hard for the team and we just need to put it in practice now.\\n\\n\\\"He's really demanding. He's exactly what we need for this type of club and that's the standard the club should be, High demanding people, really professional and working hard for the team.\\n\\n\\\"I think that's the clear message he gives us every day. He is really clear. That's what I said, we have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now it will take training sessions and games to put it into practice.\\\"\\n\\nDalot started at left wing-back and revealed the specific instructions he was given. \\\"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for every body and he wants us to have more control of the games,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I feel comfortable, I've played on the left a couple of times now. The system is new for this club but I've played with three centre backs before so I can adapt really quick.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441213.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2186651640.jpg)\\n\\nDalot started on the left.\\n\\nSo what did Amorim say in the dressing room at full-time? \\\"We will speak tomorrow, that's what he wants us to do. Recovery and speak tomorrow,\\\" said Dalot with the conversation ending.\\n\\n\\\"We have to focus on Thursday, try to win on Thursday and build from there.\\\" The last question was about Andre Onana's strong performance and Dalot added: \\\"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\\\"\\n\\nOnana has been the standout performer in a difficult start to the season but there is a growing conversation among fans about Dalot's drop off following a consistent campaign.\\n\\nThe Portuguese international has struggled to produce the same standard of displays and some have questioned whether he would benefit from a spell out of the starting side.\\n\\nEarlier this month, a source admitted that Dalot was currently feeling the effects of a gruelling campaign but said he's the type of character to continue to give everything for the team.\\n\\nDalot started 35 games from a possible 38 in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) last season and managed to avoid injury, only being unavailable once through suspension. He made a total of 50 appearances in all competitions and was always in the squad while his teammates dropped like flies.\\n\\nAvailability is the best ability and Dalot's commitment to the club can't be questioned.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Diogo Dalot](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/diogo-dalot)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

It was still staggering to see Amorim have to tell players where to position themselves without the ball and essentially instigate their back-tracking.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe familiar sight of a United player limply ceding possession before a sluggish collective response was on show at Ipswich. Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\\n\\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona. David Moyes wanted to make United \\\"run more\\\".\\n\\nAt Ipswich, United players ran a combined 102km, the second-lowest distance they have clocked up in a match this season. Amorim has not inherited a squad of workaholics.\\n\\nHe was not entirely blameless. The midfield axis of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen was backwards-thinking and backfired. Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\\n\\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \\\"one day to train\\\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\\n\\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night. Taking the time difference into account, that's the wee hours of Wednesday morning UK time. Why wasn't Ugarte back at Carrington for Friday's training session?\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Ugarte: doing a Cavani](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444346.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186663300.jpg)\\n\\nUgarte: doing a Cavani\\n\\nUgarte's compatriot, Edinson Cavani, always missed the first club game back after an international. Cavani was well into his 30s, passing by and taking United for a ride. Ugarte is 23 and purportedly the team's long-term No.6.\\n\\nAmorim admitted United players got \\\"stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\\" The transfer list?\\n\\nMatthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans have played in back threes yet Noussair Mazraoui, an auxiliary centre back, was the most accomplished of the trio.\\n\\nDe Ligt has played for four of Europe's most storied clubs and Evans is one of the most experienced professionals in the league. Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Amorim pensively watches on](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444351.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186655720.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim pensively watches on\\n\\n\\\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\\\" Amorim explained. \\\"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\\n\\n\\\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \\\"improved so much defensively\\\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\\n\\nAmorim should not have to coach Bruno Fernandes to expend less energy on complaining and protesting. Or advise Alejandro Garnacho to cut out play-acting. Marcus Rashford, a United regular for almost nine years, seemed to decide his goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes' work.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Amorim points the way forward](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444350.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185799359.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim points the way forward\\n\\nUnited did look different, though. The red shirts were dotted exactly where they should be during the uplifting first 15 minutes and Amorim's staff got to work before kick-off.\\n\\nDuring the warm up, United's back five, clad in fluorescent bibs, were pitted against the 'forward five' in a passing-and-pressing exercise. Perfecting that drill very nearly paid off when Garnacho was played in early in the second half only to shoot tamely.\\n\\nSet-piece drills are also a new addition to the pre-match preparations. First team coach Emanuel Ferro was in the thick of it, jostling with the defenders as Christian Eriksen whipped in corners and crosses. Assistant Carlos Fernandes and first team coach Adélio Cândido were also present to oversee the fine-tuning on ball retention, pressing and set-piece defending.\\n\\nUnited were still out of tune under a different coach with the same players.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

At ground level, Amorim was often on his haunches for a worm's eye view. He admitted afterwards he \\\"felt a little bit anxious\\\".\\n\\nDan Ashworth, the United sporting director, arrived in one of Ineos's chauffeured vehicles. It was less than three months ago he opined that he \\\"liked\\\" the squad. He may have revised that assessment.\\n\\nUnited are transitioning to a new formation and players have new instructions. It was still staggering to see Amorim have to tell players where to position themselves without the ball and essentially instigate their back-tracking.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe familiar sight of a United player limply ceding possession before a sluggish collective response was on show at Ipswich. Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\\n\\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona. David Moyes wanted to make United \\\"run more\\\".\\n\\nAt Ipswich, United players ran a combined 102km, the second-lowest distance they have clocked up in a match this season. Amorim has not inherited a squad of workaholics.\\n\\nHe was not entirely blameless. The midfield axis of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen was backwards-thinking and backfired. Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\\n\\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \\\"one day to train\\\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\\n\\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night. Taking the time difference into account, that's the wee hours of Wednesday morning UK time. Why wasn't Ugarte back at Carrington for Friday's training session?\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Ugarte: doing a Cavani](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444346.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186663300.jpg)\\n\\nUgarte: doing a Cavani\\n\\nUgarte's compatriot, Edinson Cavani, always missed the first club game back after an international. Cavani was well into his 30s, passing by and taking United for a ride. Ugarte is 23 and purportedly the team's long-term No.6.\\n\\nAmorim admitted United players got \\\"stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\\" The transfer list?\\n\\nMatthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans have played in back threes yet Noussair Mazraoui, an auxiliary centre back, was the most accomplished of the trio.\\n\\nDe Ligt has played for four of Europe's most storied clubs and Evans is one of the most experienced professionals in the league. Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Amorim pensively watches on](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444351.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186655720.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim pensively watches on\\n\\n\\\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\\\" Amorim explained. \\\"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\\n\\n\\\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \\\"improved so much defensively\\\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\\n\\nAmorim should not have to coach Bruno Fernandes to expend less energy on complaining and protesting. Or advise Alejandro Garnacho to cut out play-acting. Marcus Rashford, a United regular for almost nine years, seemed to decide his goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes' work.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Amorim points the way forward](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444350.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185799359.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim points the way forward\\n\\nUnited did look different, though. The red shirts were dotted exactly where they should be during the uplifting first 15 minutes and Amorim's staff got to work before kick-off.\\n\\nDuring the warm up, United's back five, clad in fluorescent bibs, were pitted against the 'forward five' in a passing-and-pressing exercise. Perfecting that drill very nearly paid off when Garnacho was played in early in the second half only to shoot tamely.\\n\\nSet-piece drills are also a new addition to the pre-match preparations. First team coach Emanuel Ferro was in the thick of it, jostling with the defenders as Christian Eriksen whipped in corners and crosses.

At ground level, Amorim was often on his haunches for a worm's eye view. He admitted afterwards he \\\"felt a little bit anxious\\\".\\n\\nDan Ashworth, the United sporting director, arrived in one of Ineos's chauffeured vehicles. It was less than three months ago he opined that he \\\"liked\\\" the squad. He may have revised that assessment.\\n\\nUnited are transitioning to a new formation and players have new instructions. It was still staggering to see Amorim have to tell players where to position themselves without the ball and essentially instigate their back-tracking.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe familiar sight of a United player limply ceding possession before a sluggish collective response was on show at Ipswich. Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\\n\\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona. David Moyes wanted to make United \\\"run more\\\".\\n\\nAt Ipswich, United players ran a combined 102km, the second-lowest distance they have clocked up in a match this season. Amorim has not inherited a squad of workaholics.\\n\\nHe was not entirely blameless. The midfield axis of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen was backwards-thinking and backfired. Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\\n\\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \\\"one day to train\\\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\\n\\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night. Taking the time difference into account, that's the wee hours of Wednesday morning UK time. Why wasn't Ugarte back at Carrington for Friday's training session?\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Ugarte: doing a Cavani](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444346.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186663300.jpg)\\n\\nUgarte: doing a Cavani\\n\\nUgarte's compatriot, Edinson Cavani, always missed the first club game back after an international. Cavani was well into his 30s, passing by and taking United for a ride. Ugarte is 23 and purportedly the team's long-term No.6.\\n\\nAmorim admitted United players got \\\"stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\\" The transfer list?\\n\\nMatthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans have played in back threes yet Noussair Mazraoui, an auxiliary centre back, was the most accomplished of the trio.\\n\\nDe Ligt has played for four of Europe's most storied clubs and Evans is one of the most experienced professionals in the league. Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Amorim pensively watches on](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444351.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186655720.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim pensively watches on\\n\\n\\\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\\\" Amorim explained. \\\"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\\n\\n\\\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \\\"improved so much defensively\\\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\\n\\nAmorim should not have to coach Bruno Fernandes to expend less energy on complaining and protesting. Or advise Alejandro Garnacho to cut out play-acting. Marcus Rashford, a United regular for almost nine years, seemed to decide his goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes' work.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Amorim points the way forward](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444350.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185799359.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim points the way forward\\n\\nUnited did look different, though. The red shirts were dotted exactly where they should be during the uplifting first 15 minutes and Amorim's staff got to work before kick-off.\\n\\nDuring the warm up, United's back five, clad in fluorescent bibs, were pitted against the 'forward five' in a passing-and-pressing exercise. Perfecting that drill very nearly paid off when Garnacho was played in early in the second half only to shoot tamely.\\n\\nSet-piece drills are also a new addition to the pre-match preparations. First team coach Emanuel Ferro was in the thick of it, jostling with the defenders as Christian Eriksen whipped in corners and crosses. Assistant Carlos Fernandes and first team coach Adélio Cândido were also present to oversee the fine-tuning on ball retention, pressing and set-piece defending.\\n\\nUnited were still out of tune under a different coach with the same players.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['Be amazed' -

It was less than three months ago he opined that he \\\"liked\\\" the squad. He may have revised that assessment.\\n\\nUnited are transitioning to a new formation and players have new instructions. It was still staggering to see Amorim have to tell players where to position themselves without the ball and essentially instigate their back-tracking.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nThe familiar sight of a United player limply ceding possession before a sluggish collective response was on show at Ipswich. Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\\n\\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona. David Moyes wanted to make United \\\"run more\\\".\\n\\nAt Ipswich, United players ran a combined 102km, the second-lowest distance they have clocked up in a match this season. Amorim has not inherited a squad of workaholics.\\n\\nHe was not entirely blameless. The midfield axis of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen was backwards-thinking and backfired. Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\\n\\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \\\"one day to train\\\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\\n\\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night. Taking the time difference into account, that's the wee hours of Wednesday morning UK time. Why wasn't Ugarte back at Carrington for Friday's training session?\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 65: Ugarte: doing a Cavani](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444346.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186663300.jpg)\\n\\nUgarte: doing a Cavani\\n\\nUgarte's compatriot, Edinson Cavani, always missed the first club game back after an international. Cavani was well into his 30s, passing by and taking United for a ride. Ugarte is 23 and purportedly the team's long-term No.6.\\n\\nAmorim admitted United players got \\\"stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\\" The transfer list?\\n\\nMatthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans have played in back threes yet Noussair Mazraoui, an auxiliary centre back, was the most accomplished of the trio.\\n\\nDe Ligt has played for four of Europe's most storied clubs and Evans is one of the most experienced professionals in the league. Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 66: Amorim pensively watches on](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444351.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2186655720.jpg)\\n\\nAmorim pensively watches on\\n\\n\\\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\\\" Amorim explained. \\\"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\\n\\n\\\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\\\"\\n\\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \\\"improved so much defensively\\\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image 67](https://cdn.convrse.media/images/mantis-recommender/mantisLogoNew.png)\\n\\n[![Image 68: Man

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThat deal handed the British billionaire oversight over football matters, as well as leading the plan for what happens with Old Trafford’s future and the plans for a new stadium.\\n\\nAmorim - who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag earlier this month - is the first changing of the managerial guard since Ratcliffe’s arrival as a minority owner of the club, and the noises already have pointed toward a change in shift when it comes to transfer policy. Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) titles to show for it.\\n\\n[CIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings](https://football-observatory.com/MonthlyReport97) from 2015 to 2024. For the period, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\\n\\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) were sixth with £587.2m, while [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) were

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\\n\\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\\n\\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   ['We will suffer' -

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories.

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 62: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 63: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 64: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 65](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 66](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 67](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 68](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Amorim's arrival during the international break restored the feel-good factor around the club but United's performance at Portman Road showed he has his work cut out.\\n\\n“It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game,\\\" he continued. \\\"That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\\n\\n\\\"But we \\\\[must not\\\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\\\"\\n\\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\n\\\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\\n\\n\\\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\\\[taking\\\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\\n\\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\\n\\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\\n\\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \\\"suffer.\\\"\\n\\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about [how ingrained his tactics were](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/he-gave-headache-premier-league-30361375) in minds at Casa Pia.\\n\\n\\\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\\\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen.

Amorim's arrival during the international break restored the feel-good factor around the club but United's performance at Portman Road showed he has his work cut out.\\n\\n“It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game,\\\" he continued. \\\"That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\\n\\n\\\"But we \\\\[must not\\\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\\\"\\n\\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\n\\\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\\n\\n\\\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\\\[taking\\\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\\n\\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\\n\\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\\n\\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \\\"suffer.\\\"\\n\\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about [how ingrained his tactics were](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/he-gave-headache-premier-league-30361375) in minds at Casa Pia.\\n\\n\\\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\\\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen. It made it easier for us to make decisions.\\n\\n\\\"I often say, and I truly mean this, that if we sat down in a huddle at Casa Pia, with one player per table as if it were a test, with a blank sheet of paper, each of us would know exactly what to do.\\n\\n\\\"We would know what passing solutions or actions we would have when we received the ball, and we would even be able to talk about positions other than our own.\\\"\\n\\nHaving that level of understanding takes time and Amorim can't fix United overnight.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-suffer-manchester-united-received-30447403#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\\n\\n\\\"But we \\\\[must not\\\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\\\"\\n\\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\n\\\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\\n\\n\\\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\\\[taking\\\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\\n\\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\\n\\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\\n\\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \\\"suffer.\\\"\\n\\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about [how ingrained his tactics were](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/he-gave-headache-premier-league-30361375) in minds at Casa Pia.\\n\\n\\\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\\\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen. It made it easier for us to make decisions.\\n\\n\\\"I often say, and I truly mean this, that if we sat down in a huddle at Casa Pia, with one player per table as if it were a test, with a blank sheet of paper, each of us would know exactly what to do.\\n\\n\\\"We would know what passing solutions or actions we would have when we received the ball, and we would even be able to talk about positions other than our own.\\\"\\n\\nHaving that level of understanding takes time and Amorim can't fix United overnight.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [The £1.1bn reason Ruben Amorim will find his Man United transfer plans impacted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/11bn-reason-ruben-amorim-find-30450630?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-suffer-manchester-united-received-30447403#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441686.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186649791.jpg)\\n\\nThe £1.1bn reason Ruben Amorim will find his Man United transfer plans impacted\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441686.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186649791.jpg)\\n\\nThe £1.1bn reason Ruben Amorim will find his Man United transfer plans impacted\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30441686.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186649791.jpg)\\n\\nThe £1.1bn reason Ruben Amorim will find his Man United transfer plans impacted\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Amorim's arrival during the international break restored the feel-good factor around the club but United's performance at Portman Road showed he has his work cut out.\\n\\n“It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game,\\\" he continued. \\\"That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\\n\\n\\\"But we \\\\[must not\\\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\\\"\\n\\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\n\\\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\\n\\n\\\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\\\[taking\\\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\\n\\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\\n\\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\\n\\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \\\"suffer.\\\"\\n\\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about [how ingrained his tactics were](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/he-gave-headache-premier-league-30361375) in minds at Casa Pia.\\n\\n\\\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\\\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us.

Amorim's arrival during the international break restored the feel-good factor around the club but United's performance at Portman Road showed he has his work cut out.\\n\\n“It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game,\\\" he continued. \\\"That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\\n\\n\\\"But we \\\\[must not\\\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\\\"\\n\\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United's best player in 2024/25 is not who everyone predicted](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ:** **[United star reveals four instructions he received from Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792)**\\n\\n\\\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\\n\\n\\\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\\\[taking\\\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\\n\\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\\n\\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\\n\\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \\\"suffer.\\\"\\n\\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about [how ingrained his tactics were](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/he-gave-headache-premier-league-30361375) in minds at Casa Pia.\\n\\n\\\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\\\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen.

Bundesliga outfit Hamburg. The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-manchester-united-sack-manager-30069556)\\n\\nFormer United forward [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\\n\\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There [has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\\n\\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \\\"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it! All the best and take care, Ruud.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Bundesliga outfit Hamburg. The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-manchester-united-sack-manager-30069556)\\n\\nFormer United forward [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\\n\\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There [has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\\n\\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \\\"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it! All the best and take care, Ruud.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-manchester-united-sack-manager-30069556)\\n\\nFormer United forward [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\\n\\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There [has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\\n\\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \\\"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it! All the best and take care, Ruud.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Bundesliga outfit Hamburg. The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-manchester-united-sack-manager-30069556)\\n\\nFormer United forward [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\\n\\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There [has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\\n\\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \\\"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it!

Bundesliga outfit Hamburg. The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-manchester-united-sack-manager-30069556)\\n\\nFormer United forward [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\\n\\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There [has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773).\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\\n\\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\\n\\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \\\"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\\n\\n\\\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it! All the best and take care, Ruud.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

[More info](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/privacy-notice)\\n\\n[Join us on WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IG57qlIoDZM56XwrenyELG)\\n\\nRobbie Savage has called on Ruben Amorim to reposition Alejandro Garnacho as wing-back in his new-look [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) side.\\n\\nGarnacho was named as one of two attacking midfielders in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road, in what was a change to the wide right and left positions he had become accustomed to under Erik ten Hag.\\n\\nHowever, Savage believes the 20-year-old would be better suited to one of the wingback roles in the 3-4-2-1 system the Portuguese tactician is trying to implement at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United have a new contender for key Amorim role after tactical switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, Savage said: \\\"I don’t think Ruben Amorim’s system suits Alejandro Garnacho. He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\\\"\\n\\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\\n\\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\\n\\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\\n\\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \\\"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\\n\\n\\\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\\n\\n\\\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\\n\\n\\\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\\\"\\n\\n### Get United transfer news and updates on WhatsApp!\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article27464952.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Untitled-5.png)\\n\\nOur team of Manchester United experts are on top of all the goings-on at Old Trafford for this week and beyond, and you can get the latest team news, injury updates, reaction and analysis along with inside information to your phone by joining our new [free WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B5dw9xqKkzMC2U7R4ZRscA).

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 9: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 10: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club.

While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 3: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Ipswich Town](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ipswichtown)\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis)\\n\\n[Share](mailto:?subject=ManchesterUnited%E2%80%99sjoylessincoherencefreesAmorimfromanyillusions|BarneyRonay&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions?CMP=share_btn_url)\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2F2024%2Fnov%2F24%2Fmanchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions&type=article&internalpagecode=football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\",\"publishedTime\":\"2024-11-24T20:43:44.000Z\",\"usage\":{\"tokens\":2358}}\n\nevent: data\ndata: {\"title\":\"Manchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions | Barney Ronay\",\"description\":\"Digesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the head coach the complexities of the task he faces\",\"url\":\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions\",\"content\":\"Manchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions | Manchester United | The Guardian\\n===============\\n\\n[Skip to main content](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#maincontent)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#navigation)[Skip to navigation](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#navigation)\\n\\n![Image 2: Manchester United’s Noussair Mazraoui, Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen look dejected after Ipswich’s equaliser.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fca2f5e42b8dc862d35b3a7ad29ea77660df3b6/187_218_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\nManchester United’s Noussair Mazraoui, Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen look dejected after Ipswich’s equaliser.

He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 4: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 5: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\\n\\n[Analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis)\\n\\nManchester United’s joyless incoherence frees Amorim from any illusions\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n[Barney Ronay](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay) at Portman Road\\n\\nDigesting the deathly spirit of this team in the flesh will have emphasised to the coach the complexities of his task\\n\\nWell, something to work on there then, Ruben. It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

One unconvincing draw against an Ipswich side that has already taken points off Aston Villa and Tottenham this season is enough evidence to realise he is wasting his time.\n\n[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) set his side up in his preferred 3-4-3 system, just as he had said he would do, and that shape helped to deliver a wonderfully crafted first goal after just 81 seconds. The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\n\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\n\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\n\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\n\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\n\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\[N’Golo\\] Kante and \\[Nemanja\\] Matic.\n\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\[Diego\\] Costa up top with \\[Eden\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\n\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\n\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\n\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\n\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\n\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\n\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

(Image: 2024 Manchester United FC)\n\nThe majority of Manchester United's players are reluctant to speak in the mixed zone - the area where journalists patiently wait - and asking each player whether they had a quick two minutes as they left Portman Road was looking like a futile task after the 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town.\n\nEach member of the squad walked past to exit the stadium and they all declined to speak, but then Diogo Dalot emerged from the dressing room by the side of a press officer.\n\nInteractions with players in the mixed zone are brief but you get a handle on their different personalities by how they respond. Dalot is hugely popular with ordinary staff at Carrington and has the same respect from journalists for answering questions when he doesn't have to.\n\nIt takes just a few minutes for a player to provide fans with insight by speaking in the mixed zone and Dalot gets it. \"We obviously didn't have a lot of days to put it all together,\" said Dalot when he was asked about Ruben Amorim and playing in the new head coach's formation.\n\n\"But I think we need to give credit to all the players involved and staff, who gave us all the information that we needed to be ready for this game. We now have a couple of days more to keep working on that and look forward to Thursday [FK Bodø/Glimt in the Europa League].\"\n\nDalot praised what Amorim is looking to change and said: \"He's made an impact straight away. I think his philosophy and the way he wants to play, I think it suits the standards of the club. The intense football, working hard for the team and we just need to put it in practice now.\n\n\"He's really demanding. He's exactly what we need for this type of club and that's the standard the club should be, high demanding people, really professional and working hard for the team.\n\n\"I think that's the clear message he gives us every day. He is really clear. That's what I said, we have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now it will take training sessions and games to put it into practice.\"\n\nDalot started at left wing-back and revealed the specific instructions he was given. \"Sprint back, really hard working, give an option and don't be afraid to have the ball. The message he gave to me was clear for everybody and he wants us to have more control of the games,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel comfortable, I've played on the left a couple of times now. The system is new for this club but I've played with three centre backs before so I can adapt really quick.\"\n\nSo what did Amorim say in the dressing room at full-time? \"We will speak tomorrow, that's what he wants us to do. Recovery and speak tomorrow,\" said Dalot with the conversation ending.\n\n\"We have to focus on Thursday, try to win on Thursday and build from there.\" The last question was about Andre Onana's strong performance and Dalot added: \"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\"\n\nOnana has been the standout performer in a difficult start to the season but there is a growing conversation among fans about Dalot's drop off following a consistent campaign. Dalot started 35 games from a possible 38 in the Premier League last season and managed to avoid injury, only being unavailable once through suspension. He made a total of 50 appearances in all competitions and was always in the squad while his teammates dropped like flies.\n\nAvailability is the best ability and Dalot's commitment to the club can't be questioned.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

At ground level, Amorim was often on his haunches for a worm's eye view. He admitted afterwards he \"felt a little bit anxious\".\n\nDan Ashworth, the United sporting director, arrived in one of Ineos's chauffeured vehicles. It was less than three months ago he opined that he \"liked\" the squad. He may have revised that assessment.\n\nUnited are transitioning to a new formation and players have new instructions. It was still staggering to see Amorim have to tell players where to position themselves without the ball and essentially instigate their back-tracking.\n\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\n\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\n\nThe familiar sight of a United player limply ceding possession before a sluggish collective response was on show at Ipswich. Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\n\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona. David Moyes wanted to make United \"run more\".\n\nAt Ipswich, United players ran a combined 102km, the second-lowest distance they have clocked up in a match this season. Amorim has not inherited a squad of workaholics.\n\nHe was not entirely blameless. The midfield axis of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen was backwards-thinking and backfired. Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\n\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \"one day to train\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\n\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night. Taking the time difference into account, that's the wee hours of Wednesday morning UK time. Why wasn't Ugarte back at Carrington for Friday's training session?\n\nUgarte's compatriot, Edinson Cavani, always missed the first club game back after an international. Cavani was well into his 30s, passing by and taking United for a ride. Ugarte is 23 and purportedly the team's long-term No.6.\n\nAmorim admitted United players got \"stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\" The transfer list?\n\nMatthijs de Ligt and Jonny Evans have played in back threes yet Noussair Mazraoui, an auxiliary centre back, was the most accomplished of the trio.\n\nDe Ligt has played for four of Europe's most storied clubs and Evans is one of the most experienced professionals in the league. Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\n\n\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\" Amorim explained. \"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\n\n\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\"\n\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \"improved so much defensively\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\n\nAmorim should not have to coach Bruno Fernandes to expend less energy on complaining and protesting. Or advise Alejandro Garnacho to cut out play-acting. Marcus Rashford, a United regular for almost nine years, seemed to decide his goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes' work.\n\nUnited did look different, though. The red shirts were dotted exactly where they should be during the uplifting first 15 minutes and Amorim's staff got to work before kick-off.\n\nDuring the warm-up, United's back five, clad in fluorescent bibs, were pitted against the 'forward five' in a passing-and-pressing exercise. Perfecting that drill very nearly paid off when Garnacho was played in early in the second half only to shoot tamely.\n\nSet-piece drills are also a new addition to the pre-match preparations. First team coach Emanuel Ferro was in the thick of it, jostling with the defenders as Christian Eriksen whipped in corners and crosses. Assistant Carlos Fernandes and first team coach Adélio Cândido were also present to oversee the fine-tuning on ball retention, pressing and set-piece defending.\n\nUnited were still out of tune under a different coach with the same players.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ratcliffe and his INEOS team are expected to hand the Portuguese more modest sums over the coming transfer windows, moving themselves away from an era of rinse-and-repeat excess when it comes to wages and fees paid that has yielded precious little in terms of competitive success, which is the very thing it was designed to deliver.\n\nRatcliffe’s approach shouldn’t be surprising. Figures produced last week by the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory highlighted just how profligate the club had been when compared to their rivals when it came to spending heavily, especially in the context of a lack of Premier League titles to show for it.\n\nCIES analysed transfer incomings and outgoings from 2015 to 2024. For the period, United came out as the worst performers in Europe when it came to negative spending. The club had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the nine-year period in question.\n\nThat figure was enough to see them as the highest net spenders, with Chelsea (£1.01bn), Paris Saint-Germain (£827.7m), Arsenal (£664m), and Tottenham Hotspur (£593.9m) rounding out the top five. Manchester City were sixth with £587.2m, while Liverpool were the best performers of the so-called ‘big six’ with £305.7m.\n\nThe figure highlights that there has been no shortage of resource made available to a succession of United managers, but there has been a lack of a clear and defined transfer strategy that has resulted in over-inflated fees and much tumult, with value seldom realised on the sale of outgoing talent, as well as a less than stellar figure produced from moving on academy graduates, which results in pure profit. Chelsea have been particularly successful at that over the last few years.\n\nIn terms of actual transfer spend committed by clubs, including add-ons, over the same time period in question, United rank third on the list at €1.95bn (£1.63bn), behind City in second (£1.64bn) and Chelsea, way out in front with a mammoth transfer spend of £2.32bn. More than £1bn of that has been committed during the last two years of ownership of the Blues by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital.\n\nFor Ratcliffe, the era of excess of United is set to come to an end. For Amorim and sporting director Dan Ashworth and the newly-assembled team underneath him, finding value in the market will be where the focus now lies in the quest to return the club to former glories.\n\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

The move went from back to front and involved excellent interchange and individual skill. It was an early example of what the 39-year-old wants to deliver.\n\nBut there's no doubt his team struggled to get to grips with the system at times. Is that a surprise? Not exactly. The full squad had just two training sessions to master not only Amorim's demands but his new system. A couple of weeks ago Matthijs de Ligt said playing in a back three wasn't notably different to a back four, but it does come with different ideas. Amorim is introducing changes to [United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) build-up play and how they defend.\n\nSo it was hardly surprising it didn't flow from the off at Portman Road, especially with the squad still feeling the effects of injury and exhaustion from internationals. When Amorim is finally able to start his strongest team, it will probably include [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro), Lisandro Martinez, Manuel Ugarte, [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kobbie-mainoo), and perhaps Luke Shaw as well.\n\nWith every passing game, we can expect this team and these players to look more comfortable in the system. Time on the training pitches is limited at this time of year, but those sessions will see gains made, and it will all become more familiar to the players.\n\nAmorim has had plenty of success with that system. It has delivered Sporting two league titles and left them well-placed to win a third. Earlier this month, Amorim's Sporting tore Manchester City apart and beat the Premier League champions 4-1. But after two training sessions and one game in the Premier League, he has already been told to give it up.\n\n“I’d be amazed if they were still playing a 3-4-3 in a year’s time,\" said Danny Murphy on Match of the Day. \"This league’s very, very different from continental leagues. We’ve only had Chelsea, in recent years, win playing that system and let’s be honest, they had \\[N’Golo\\] Kante and \\[Nemanja\\] Matic.\n\n“Two wonderful defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch and \\[Diego\\] Costa up top with \\[Eden\\] Hazard supporting him and helping him as well.\n\n“They don’t have those players yet and how do you find them? It costs hundreds of millions to get the best players in the world. I think when you play three at the back against the majority of good teams in our league, who play three high, you end up being a five and that’s really difficult. If United are going to get much better and competitive, I think that 3-4-3 will evolve into something else.”\n\nThis league didn't look that different from continental leagues when City were unable to cope with Sporting's 3-4-3 system in the Champions League. Leaving three up that night didn't help them.\n\nOn Sunday, United often attacked with five, with the wing-backs almost forming a line of attackers across the pitch as they tore forward. At times they will inevitably be called into action defensively.\n\nBut United will have deeper midfielders in the two holding roles who can plug any gaps defensively. Amorim's system aims to dominate and ensure that they aren't pinned back and forced to defend in a five.\n\nHis biggest issue at Ipswich was that lack of familiarity for the players and their lack of physicality. That problem won't be fixed quickly, but more energy and intensity are required.\n\nDeliver that and there is no doubt a back three can thrive in the Premier League. United have problems to solve in the early days of the Amorim era, but the system isn't one at the moment. Give it time.\n\n**READ NEXT:**\n\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

At least three players should be all but certain to go.\n\nBy\nSamuel Luckhurst Chief Manchester United writer\n\nMoney is so tight at Manchester United when Erik ten Hag wanted to revert to overnight stays at a nearby hotel before home games last season, he was informed the money was not there.\n\nUnited restored a players' lounge at Old Trafford at the start of last season at Ten Hag's request. That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\n\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\n\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\n\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\n\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\n\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\" Amorim bluntly said.\n\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\n\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\n\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\n\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\n\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\n\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\n\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amorim's arrival during the international break restored the feel-good factor around the club but United's performance at Portman Road showed he has his work cut out.\n\n“It’s not a surprise but you have to see it in-game,\" he continued. \"That’s why I was a little bit anxious because you cannot understand what will happen in the game. I felt that. They are thinking too much because things are so different. It’s hard for the players in three days to cope with everything.\n\n\"But we \\[must not\\] forget about the new idea. That’s why I was brought here and we try to cope with the things they are used to doing. Next year, in the same stage, we will be here with the same problems or we start now … we risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and next year will be better.\"\n\n“We start very well but then we should have more possession. Sometimes, we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking: ‘Where should I be?.\n\n\"They need time to have some fluidity. I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period.\n\n\"This will take time. We could lose if it was not for Onana so we have to understand that and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much. We will have a situation where you see a structure and you will say: ‘It’s not fluid.’ But it is like \\[taking\\] steps. We have to put in the heads the structure. When they start thinking about the structure they will play so much better.”\n\nAmorim's comments were fascinating. He provided insight into the nuances of learning his new formation and suggested United needed to suffer now to reap the rewards later.\n\nNobody wants to keep harping back to Erik ten Hag's tenure, but he was forced into a tactical compromise at the very beginning of his reign after a shocking start and results continued to be prioritised instead of implementing a style of play that would have been better in the long-term.\n\nAmorim can't make the same mistake and is hell bent on immediately implementing his system, even if that means there will be teething problems and games in which United \"suffer.\"\n\nIt's going to take time for the players to learn what he wants inside out and patience will be required. The _Manchester Evening News_ recently interviewed one of Amorim's former players, David Rosa, and he spoke about how ingrained his tactics were at Casa Pia.\n\n\"He knows his game model so well that he can explain it clearly and simply to any player in any position. And that meant when we were on the pitch, we knew exactly what to do,\" said Rosa.\n\n\"It wasn't as if we were robots, but we knew that whenever we received the ball what was going to happen around us. That gave us a great advantage, which was that we had some predictability about what was going to happen. It made it easier for us to make decisions.\n\n\"I often say, and I truly mean this, that if we sat down in a huddle at Casa Pia, with one player per table as if it were a test, with a blank sheet of paper, each of us would know exactly what to do.\n\n\"We would know what passing solutions or actions we would have when we received the ball, and we would even be able to talk about positions other than our own.\"\n\nHaving that level of understanding takes time and Amorim can't fix United overnight.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Bundesliga outfit Hamburg. The 48-year-old has not been out of work long after leaving Manchester United earlier this month, having taken over the reigns at Old Trafford on an interim basis after Erik ten Hag was sacked back in October.\n\nFormer United forward Van Nistelrooy re-joined the club in the summer to become Ten Hag's assistant, but was promoted to the top job following their 2-1 defeat at West Ham last month. Van Nistelrooy ended up winning three of his four matches in charge before Ruben Amorim's arrival.\n\nBidding for an instant return to the dugout, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy had applied for the vacant manager's position at Championship side Coventry. There has also since been talk that the Dutchman could be a contender to replace Steve Cooper at Leicester.\n\nBut now, according to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is expected to become Hamburg's new boss after the German second-tier side decided to sack head coach Steffen Baumgart. Hamburg sit eighth in 2. Bundesliga - four points off the top - following a 2-2 draw with Schalke on Sunday.\n\nVan Nistelrooy was already a topic of discussion before Baumgart was appointed back in February, but Hamburg have now decided that the former PSV manager is going to get his chance to impress. Van Nistelrooy played for Hamburg at the back end of his playing career, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances.\n\nIn a statement after departing United, Van Nistelrooy said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"To everyone at Manchester United Football Club, in particular the backroom staff, the players and the fans. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible efforts and support.\n\n\"It has been a privilege and honour to represent the club as a player, coach and manager, and I will always cherish the memories we have shared together. @ManUtd will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope there are many more glory days at Old Trafford very soon - not only because I want the club to do well, but because you all deserve it! All the best and take care, Ruud.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amorim clapped his hands to command the players to sprint. With full-time looming, he chastised them for failing to press.\n\nHe will have to get used to that. United have been inept at pressing since Sir Alex Ferguson's final years, with it most glaringly exposed in the two Champions League final surrenders to Barcelona.

Kobbie Mainoo, completely unused, appeared downbeat as he left the ground.\n\nQuestions must also be asked of Manuel Ugarte. Amorim clarified that he had \"one day to train\". In September, Erik ten Hag said Ugarte was the last to arrive from South America ahead of the trek to Southampton.\n\nWhy is he always late? Uruguay played Brazil in Salvador on Tuesday night.

Evans is 37 in January and can be cut some slack. De Ligt cannot. He is consistently unable to take command of defender-striker duels and got bullied by Liam Delap.\n\n\"They are thinking too much because things are so different,\" Amorim explained. \"Some details, they used to pass the ball and go forward. Even the centre backs. Now they have to go back. These type of things they start going forward and they have to think too much.\n\n\"(Diogo) Dalot used to do it: pass the ball to centre backs, go inside, play as a midfielder. Now he has to stick to this position.\"\n\nMazraoui and Amad, both playing in new positions, were United's only respectable outfield performers. Amorim said Amad had \"improved so much defensively\" in only three days. Perhaps the players are not due any leeway.\n\nAmorim should not have to coach Bruno Fernandes to expend less energy on complaining and protesting. Or advise Alejandro Garnacho to cut out play-acting. Marcus Rashford, a United regular for almost nine years, seemed to decide his goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes' work.\n\nUnited did look different, though. The red shirts were dotted exactly where they should be during the uplifting first 15 minutes and Amorim's staff got to work before kick-off.\n\nDuring the warm-up, United's back five, clad in fluorescent bibs, were pitted against the 'forward five' in a passing-and-pressing exercise. Perfecting that drill very nearly paid off when Garnacho was played in early in the second half only to shoot tamely.\n\nSet-piece drills are also a new addition to the pre-match preparations. First team coach Emanuel Ferro was in the thick of it, jostling with the defenders as Christian Eriksen whipped in corners and crosses. Assistant Carlos Fernandes and first team coach Adélio Cândido were also present to oversee the fine-tuning on ball retention, pressing and set-piece defending.\n\nUnited were still out of tune under a different coach with the same players.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

He was used as one of the number tens. I think he is better as one of the wing-backs.\"\n\nSince debuting for the first team in April 2022, Garnacho has made 105 appearances for the Reds and established himself as a key player under Ten Hag prior to the Dutchman's sacking.\n\nUnited had given Amorim the dream start to his managerial career in the Premier League as Marcus Rashford opened the scoring after less than two minutes.\n\nHowever, the Reds were pegged back midway through the first half when Omari Hutchinson's curling effort beat Andre Onana from range.\n\nSpeaking after the game, Amorim said: \"They were trying, they were thinking too much during the game and that is normal. We start very well but then we should have more possession with the ball, kept the ball and sometimes we had the ball in defence and the rest of the guys were too stuck because they were thinking, 'where should I be?'\n\n\"So this is the first point, when we make a new structure and you are so clear on that, they need time to have some fluidity in the game and I felt that. But it’s two games and I felt they did okay.\n\n\"What I understood today is they are trying, they are really trying, they stay in the positions, they receive the information and they try to use it in the game, that is very important. Even in the difficult moments I felt they were doing the things we wanted them to do.\n\n\"I know it’s frustrating for the fans but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games. We are going to suffer for a long period and we will try to win games, this will take time. We have to win games but we could lose if it was not for Onana. So I think we have to understand that and think and be pragmatic that these guys had two days to train to change so much.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Absolutely mental fans.”\n\nOf course, aside from Liverpool and Manchester City, Leeds are one of United’s most fierce rivals, so the atmosphere undoubtedly ramps up when the Red Devils visit West Yorkshire.\n\nDuring his playing days, Scholes faced the Whites in 16 matches, coming away as a winner on ten occasions.\n\nThe former United midfielder’s last appearance against the now Championship side came in February 2004 as he scored in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.\n\nLeeds were relegated from the Premier League that season and spent 13 years in the second tier before finally being promoted back to the top-flight in 2020.\n\nIn December 2020, Leeds visited Old Trafford for their first league clash against Man United since 2004, but they went home disappointed.\n\nThe home side put in an excellent showing, going 2-0 up in just three minutes thanks to a Scott McTominay double before Bruno Fernandes and Victor Lindelof put the Red Devils 4-0 up after just 37 minutes.\n\nLiam Cooper and Stuart Dallas netted for Leeds on either side of Daniel James’ (now of Leeds) goal for Man United to make the scoreline more respectable as the game finished 6-2.\n\nIn the return fixture in April of 2021, the sides played out a dull 0-0 draw.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

We will try to win games, but this will take time.\n\n\"We have to risk it a little bit [now], and in the next year, we will be better [otherwise] next year at the same stage, we will be here with the same problems.\"\n\nHowever, his job could be made easier in the January transfer window, which may allow him to bring in his own choice of players.\n\nSporting’s Geovany Quenda, 17, is reportedly the subject of interest from United, with Amorim’s former club ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign the player, according to A BOLA.\n\nThe right-winger/wing-back has featured 11 times in Liga Portugal this season and is already used to Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.\n\nGeovany Quenda has been linked with Manchester United (Credit:Getty)\n\nQuenda became Sporting’s youngest-ever goal scorer when he netted in a 4-3 loss against Porto in the Portuguese Super Cup in August - breaking Cristiano Ronaldo’s record.\n\nIt is unclear if the Portugal youth international would slot straight into Amorim’s starting XI, but he would likely provide competition for Amad, who started yesterday’s match as United’s right-winger/wing-back.\n\nThe Ivorian is used to playing in a more advanced role, and given the fact usual left-back Diogo Dalot started on the left flank, it would be fair to say this leaves the side unbalanced.\n\nAnd it is not just Quenda who is being monitored.\n\nAccording to Scouts in Attendance, United, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona will have scouts at Sporting’s Champions League match against Arsenal on Wednesday.\n\nThe highly rated forward Viktor Gyökeres is reportedly being ‘monitored’ by some of Europe’s top clubs, with the Sweden international having already scored 24 times in 19 appearances for the Portuguese club this term.\n\nThe 26-year-old's current deal is set to run until 2028 meaning a hefty fee of around £62m may need to be offered for Sporting to consider selling the player according to The Standard.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

There is no club like this. But in the end, it is not in my hands.\n\n“As I said, it is December, and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end, it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nHe also went on to admit he felt “disappointed” by the situation.\n\nThis prompted Sky Sports’ pundit Carragher to voice how he was in fact, disappointed at Salah’s timing given the fact Liverpool face Real Madrid and Manchester City this week.\n\n“I must say, I am very disappointed with Mo Salah,” Carragher said on Sky Sports’ MNF.\n\n\"[With] that interview yesterday…Liverpool have got Real Madrid midweek and Manchester City at the weekend – that’s the story for Liverpool right now.\n\n“And Mo Salah, we’re all quite aware…that in the seven years he has been at the football club, he’s stopped in the mixed zone twice, which is his right, which is absolutely fine.\n\n“But he decided to stop for the third time away at Southampton on the back of winning Liverpool the game.”\n\nHowever, Carragher had seemingly given a less harsh view of the situation earlier in the broadcast and gave a considered take on what he felt the issue between both parties is.\n\n\"I think it's pretty obvious what the issue is what Mo Salah feels he's worth, whether that's in financial terms or length of contract is completely different to what Liverpool feel at this moment,\" explained Carragher.\n\n\"I just hope they meet somewhere in the middle at some stage between now and the end of the season, as I'm desperate to see him in a Liverpool shirt next season.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

So, the tracksuit stayed. And the coincidence did not stop there as his team went on a fine run of form, beating city rivals Liverpool and Brentford in a six-day period to ensure their Premier League status.\n\nSo maybe there is a method to coach’s rituals after all.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

We will try to win games, but this will take time.\n\n\"We have to risk it a little bit [now], and in the next year, we will be better [otherwise] next year at the same stage, we will be here with the same problems.\"\n\nHowever, his job could be made easier in the January transfer window, which may allow him to bring in his own choice of players.\n\nSporting’s Geovany Quenda, 17, is reportedly the subject of interest from United, with Amorim’s former club ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign the player, according to A BOLA.\n\nThe right-winger/wing-back has featured 11 times in Liga Portugal this season and is already used to Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.\n\nGeovany Quenda has been linked with Manchester United (Credit:Getty)\n\nQuenda became Sporting’s youngest-ever goal scorer when he netted in a 4-3 loss against Porto in the Portuguese Super Cup in August - breaking Cristiano Ronaldo’s record.\n\nIt is unclear if the Portugal youth international would slot straight into Amorim’s starting XI, but he would likely provide competition for Amad, who started yesterday’s match as United’s right-winger/wing-back.\n\nThe Ivorian is used to playing in a more advanced role, and given the fact usual left-back Diogo Dalot started on the left flank, it would be fair to say this leaves the side unbalanced.\n\nAnd it is not just Quenda who is being monitored.\n\nAccording to Scouts in Attendance, United, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona will have scouts at Sporting’s Champions League match against Arsenal on Wednesday.\n\nThe highly rated forward Viktor Gyökeres is reportedly being ‘monitored’ by some of Europe’s top clubs, with the Sweden international having already scored 24 times in 19 appearances for the Portuguese club this term.\n\nThe 26-year-old's current deal is set to run until 2028 meaning a hefty fee of around £62m may need to be offered for Sporting to consider selling the player according to The Standard.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

        "article_text": "Manchester United have ramped up their efforts to sign one of Ruben Amorim’s players from his time at Sporting Club.\n\nAmorim, 39, took charge of his game as head coach of United on Sunday and saw his side play out a 1-1 draw against Ipswich at Portman Road.\n\nOf course, the United faithful would have been hoping for three points, but there were certainly positives to take from the showing in Suffolk.\n\nThe former Braga boss admitted that his side will “suffer” as they get to grips with his playing style and ideas.\n\n“I know it is frustrating for the fans, but we are changing so much in this moment with a lot of games,\" Amorim said.\n\n\"We are going to suffer for a long period. We will try to win games, but this will take time.\n\n\"We have to risk it a little bit [now], and in the next year, we will be better [otherwise] next year at the same stage, we will be here with the same problems.\"\n\nHowever, his job could be made easier in the January transfer window, which may allow him to bring in his own choice of players.\n\nSporting’s Geovany Quenda, 17, is reportedly the subject of interest from United, with Amorim’s former club ‘open to negotiating’ as the Red Devils are set to ‘offer’ around £50m to sign the player, according to A BOLA.\n\nThe right-winger/wing-back has featured 11 times in Liga Portugal this season and is already used to Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.\n\nGeovany Quenda has been linked with Manchester United (Credit:Getty)\n\nQuenda became Sporting’s youngest-ever goal scorer when he netted in a 4-3 loss against Porto in the Portuguese Super Cup in August - breaking Cristiano Ronaldo’s record.\n\nIt is unclear if the Portugal youth international would slot straight into Amorim’s starting XI, but he would likely provide competition for Amad, who started yesterday’s match as United’s right-winger/wing-back.\n\nThe Ivorian is used to playing in a more advanced role, and given the fact usual left-back Diogo Dalot started on the left flank, it would be fair to say this leaves the side unbalanced.\n\nAnd it is not just Quenda who is being monitored.\n\nAccording to Scouts in Attendance, United, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Barcelona will have scouts at Sporting’s Champions League match against Arsenal on Wednesday.\n\nThe highly rated forward Viktor Gyökeres is reportedly being ‘monitored’ by some of Europe’s top clubs, with the Sweden international having already scored 24 times in 19 appearances for the Portuguese club this term.\n\nThe 26-year-old's current deal is set to run until 2028 meaning a hefty fee of around £62m may need to be offered for Sporting to consider selling the player according to The Standard.",

Almost like he got caught doing something he shouldn't have, haha.”\n\nA second added: “What a mess so far by LFC. Poor summer window signing a crocked winger and a keeper when we have two of the best.\n\n“Failure to get a midfielder and now on the cusp of losing club legends.

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\n\nAs well as being the best player in the Premier League he’s a cultural icon across the Arab world and beyond.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

        "article_text": "Arne Slot has bizarre superstition he sticks to every Liverpool matchday to avoid bad luck - Champions League - SPORTbible =============== Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has a ritual he follows on matchdays, according to reports. Slot, 46, took charge of the Reds in June 2024 following Jurgen Klopp’s departure. Given the fact he had come from the Eredivisie, both fans and the British media were unsure how he would take to life as a Premier League boss. But even the most optimistic of Liverpool fans could not have predicted his start to life at Anfield. A Mohamed Salah brace saw the Reds to a 3-2 comeback victory against Southampton at St Mary’s on Sunday. The win meant Slot’s side went eight points clear of second place Manchester City in the Premier League table. They currently sit top of the 36-team Champions League table with a perfect four wins from four games so far this term. Of course, Slot’s tactics, Liverpool’s players and even the Anfield atmosphere could all be contributing factors to their success, but there may be a more alternative reason at play. According to Mail Sport, the Dutchman has a superstition which involves avoiding looking at the clock at exactly 13.13 (1:13 or am) for several years, as he believes the number can mean bad luck. And luckily for Slot, Liverpool don’t have a ‘13’ in their official squad list. But he is not the only football manager to have fairly odd superstitions. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone is thought to be keen on routines which could also pass as superstitions. Guilherme Siqueira, who played for the La Liga outfit from 2014 to 2017, revealed that the Argentine had the same music playlist on the team coach and in the changing room ahead of games. “In recent times, Slot’s Merseyside rival Everton boss Sean Dyche even switched up his choice of clothing on matchday. Dyche was known for his long-sleeved white shirt and blue tie. But during a relegation ‘six-pointer’ against Nottingham Forest in April 2024, the Toffees’ boss wore a club tracksuit to the surprise of many. Strangely enough, his side won 2-0. So, the tracksuit stayed. And the coincidence did not stop there as his team went on a fine run of form, beating city rivals Liverpool and Brentford in a six-day period to ensure their Premier League status.

Salah, 32, scored a brace to help the Reds go eight points clear of second-place Manchester City in the race for the Premier League. However, it was Salah’s comments he made to reporters waiting in the ‘mixed zone’ that really made the headlines after full-time. The Egyptian discussed his future with the gathered press pack. \"We are almost in December, and I haven't received any offers yet to stay in the club,” said Salah outside the Players Entrance at St Mary’s. \"I'm probably more out than in,” he admitted.

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half. \n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\n\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\n\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what Manchester United need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\n\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Ipswich. Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham. If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, against Villa on Saturday. His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal, and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

        "article_text": "Pundit sat behind Ruben Amorim reveals Man Utd manager was ‘frustrated’ with three players during Ipswich draw - Man Utd - SPORTbible =============== Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has revealed that new manager Ruben Amorim was not happy with three players on the touchline during his side's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town. Amorim was standing in the dugout for the first time as United manager at Portman Road, and saw his side get off to the ideal start as they went 1-0 up in 80 seconds through Marcus Rashford. While certain aspects will have pleased Amorim, such as the performances of Amad Diallo and Andre Onana, other parts of the display will no doubt be familiar after the hours of match analysis the 39-year-old will have done in recent weeks. Ipswich would equalise before half-time through Omari Hutchinson's deflected long-range effort, and Kieran McKenna's side looked more likely to go on and win the game in the second half. Speaking on Sky Sports after the game, Amorim was honest in his assessment of how United performed on the day and the work that needs to be done. He also namedropped several players, including centre-back Jonny Evans, when looking back at moments that could have been handled differently during the game. But Hargreaves, who was sat behind the new manager in the stands as a pundit for Premier League Productions, has revealed Amorim's private frustrations on the touchline with three other United players in particular. He explained: \"He was pretty frustrated, I'm not going to lie. He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things. \"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.  \"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well.

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

The three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships. There was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans. But it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net. Amorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried. And for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good. Jawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements. The United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into. United’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half. Either side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game. Amorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.",

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham. If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, against Villa on Saturday. His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal, and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

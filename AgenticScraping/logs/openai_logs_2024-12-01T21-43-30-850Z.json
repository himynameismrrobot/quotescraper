Garnacho can't cross or shoot. Bodo/Glimt should wrap up their second successive domestic title at the weekend - they would have destroyed an Erik ten Hag team, so they are no walkover! Great possession in positions where it mattered and 20 shots! Hojlund was great.\\n    \\n    **Adam:** Taking the lead so early and then throwing it away to go 2-1 down so soon after just shows the frailty of the new system. We were exposed too often but, thankfully, they weren't the strongest of teams so we got off lightly. The major positive of the night has to be Hojlund. He is showing that if you feed him properly, he will do the rest!\\n    \\n    **Amogh:** Ruben Amorim showed he is decisive with substitutions and tactically flexible. My worry is that he doesn't have the players to play the system that he wants to play, and that means people playing out of position and not to their strengths. You can get away with that against a mid-table team, but not against a top eight team in the Premier League.\\n    \\n    **Brendan:** Ugarte is the glue that keeps this team together. He is a similar player to Roy Keane - impressive. Malacia had so much ball but he was not able to cope with or penetrate the defence. Shaw was dependable as usual. Rashford, regretfully, is a total lost cause and he needs to move on.\\n    \\n    **Alex:** Positive signs, definitely, but we have to make sure we don't get too excited. The great thing is that we are starting to see an identity within this team, which we haven't seen in a very long time. I'm very interested to see where we go from here and what our optimal line-up will be.\\n    \\n    ![Image 53: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

Joshua Zirkzee struck before half time to put United 2-0 up.\\n\\nRashford grabbed his second to end the game as a contest shortly after the break and Zirkzee then joined him on two goals for the afternoon to make it 4-0.\\n\\nHere are how the players rated at Old Trafford:\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United meet Jorge Mendes over possible Geovany Quenda transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\\n\\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\\n\\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\\n\\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\\n\\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\\n\\n**Harry Maguire**\\n\\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nLast to come on. 6\\n\\n**Manager**\\n\\nRotated heavily again and it seemed to count against United until the opening goal on 34 minutes. An intense presence on the touchline, he kept the players on their toes and made sensible substitutions. 7\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

with Fernandes and Zirkzee\\n\\nManchester United thumped Everton 4-0 in Ruben Amorim’s first home Premier League game in charge.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford gave [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) the lead as his half-volley found the back of the net after a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite. Joshua Zirkzee struck before half time to put United 2-0 up.\\n\\nRashford grabbed his second to end the game as a contest shortly after the break and Zirkzee then joined him on two goals for the afternoon to make it 4-0.\\n\\nHere are how the players rated at Old Trafford:\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United meet Jorge Mendes over possible Geovany Quenda transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\\n\\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\\n\\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\\n\\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\\n\\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\\n\\n**Harry Maguire**\\n\\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nLast to come on. 6\\n\\n**Manager**\\n\\nRotated heavily again and it seemed to count against United until the opening goal on 34 minutes. An intense presence on the touchline, he kept the players on their toes and made sensible substitutions. 7\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

players rated at Old Trafford:\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton

transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\\n\\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\\n\\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\\n\\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\\n\\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\\n\\n**Harry Maguire**\\n\\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nLast to come on. 6\\n\\nSIMILAR

transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\\n\\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\\n\\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\\n\\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\\n\\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\\n\\n**Harry Maguire**\\n\\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nLast to come on. 6\\n\\nSIMILAR

transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-meet-geovany-quendas-30482307)**\\n\\n**Andre Onana**\\n\\nDidn't do anything wrong during a difficult first half for United and had a much quieter second 45 minutes as he kept a clean sheet. Saved late on from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. 7\\n\\n**Noussair Mazraoui**\\n\\nHad a more testing time against Iliman Ndiaye but came through it to help keep United's sheet clean before he was rested. 6\\n\\n**Matthijs de Ligt**\\n\\nOutpaced by Beto for Everton's best chance with the game goalless as he failed to dominate another defender-striker duel. Came off before the hour. 5\\n\\n**Lisandro Martinez**\\n\\nGave Everton an early sighter with a sloppy pass that came to nought. Played Dalot in for a good opening but booked for a cynical foul. 6\\n\\n**Amad**\\n\\nScooped a good chance well wide but forced Jarrad Branthwaite into the mistake that led to the second goal and brilliantly played in Marcus Rashford for the third. 8\\n\\n**Casemiro**\\n\\nHis tendency to slide in desperately was evident again but Everton never took advantage of Casemiro's clumsiness. 5\\n\\n**Kobbie Mainoo**\\n\\nBegan brightly on his first start in eight weeks but failed to sustain that momentum. Got booked for tugging back Dwight McNeil. 6\\n\\n**Diogo Dalot**\\n\\nA more purposeful presence on the left-hand side though his end product was often lacking. A gradual improvement this week. 6\\n\\n**Bruno Fernandes**\\n\\nAssisted both first-half goals, although he seemed to overhit the pass that Zirkzee finished as it seemed intended for Amad. Came off for a rest with the game won. 7\\n\\n**Marcus Rashford**\\n\\nPut United ahead with a sweetly-timed half-volley that deflected in off Branthwaite and made the right run to finish Amad's pass. 7\\n\\n**Joshua Zirkzee**\\n\\nGot his first club goal in 18 games by salvaging Fernandes's overhit pass to make it 2-0 and had a key role in the third goal before coolly making it 4-0. 8\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n**Luke Shaw**\\n\\nGot more fulfilling minutes in third sub appearance running. 6\\n\\n**Harry Maguire**\\n\\nBack in the team for the first time in eight weeks. 6\\n\\n**Alejandro Garnacho**\\n\\nEmbarked on some energetic bursts. 6\\n\\n**Manuel Ugarte**\\n\\nCoasted through the final quarter. 6\\n\\n**Mason Mount**\\n\\nLast to come on. 6\\n\\nSIMILAR

He was really good defending and really good attacking.\\n\\n\\\"So he needs to continue to play like that. You could feel it at the end of the game he was really, really tired, so we need to manage that to increase physical ability.\\\"\\n\\nUnited scored early on in Amorim's first two games in charge but the 39-year-old refused to take too much credit for their fast starts. \\\"No, I’m just really, really lucky,\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"We want to play well because it’s better to start a game by scoring. If you look at the three games, all the decisive moments were for us. You have to acknowledge that.\\n\\n\\\"Today we started very well but lost the control of the game. We were following the ball without any possession after the 15 minutes, but then we score in the set-piece play, so that was a key point for us. And near half-time we scored again, and then we scored the third goal.\\n\\n\\\"So we must acknowledge that in the right moments in these three games we scored goals. On Thursday, we controlled the ball well but today we had some difficulties.\\n\\n\\\"After the 15 minutes and we had some possession just to keep the ball, not to be so dangerous, but let’s see. Three games without training they did a great job. This victory is more for the players than the coach.\\\"\\n\\nUnited take on Arsenal away at the Emirates on Wednesday night.

He was really good defending and really good attacking.\\n\\n\\\"So he needs to continue to play like that. You could feel it at the end of the game he was really, really tired, so we need to manage that to increase physical ability.\\\"\\n\\nUnited scored early on in Amorim's first two games in charge but the 39-year-old refused to take too much credit for their fast starts. \\\"No, I’m just really, really lucky,\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"We want to play well because it’s better to start a game by scoring. If you look at the three games, all the decisive moments were for us. You have to acknowledge that.\\n\\n\\\"Today we started very well but lost the control of the game. We were following the ball without any possession after the 15 minutes, but then we score in the set-piece play, so that was a key point for us. And near half-time we scored again, and then we scored the third goal.\\n\\n\\\"So we must acknowledge that in the right moments in these three games we scored goals. On Thursday, we controlled the ball well but today we had some difficulties.\\n\\n\\\"After the 15 minutes and we had some possession just to keep the ball, not to be so dangerous, but let’s see.

He was really good defending and really good attacking.\\n\\n\\\"So he needs to continue to play like that. You could feel it at the end of the game he was really, really tired, so we need to manage that to increase physical ability.\\\"\\n\\nUnited scored early on in Amorim's first two games in charge but the 39-year-old refused to take too much credit for their fast starts. \\\"No, I’m just really, really lucky,\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"We want to play well because it’s better to start a game by scoring. If you look at the three games, all the decisive moments were for us. You have to acknowledge that.\\n\\n\\\"Today we started very well but lost the control of the game. We were following the ball without any possession after the 15 minutes, but then we score in the set-piece play, so that was a key point for us. And near half-time we scored again, and then we scored the third goal.\\n\\n\\\"So we must acknowledge that in the right moments in these three games we scored goals. On Thursday, we controlled the ball well but today we had some difficulties.\\n\\n\\\"After the 15 minutes and we had some possession just to keep the ball, not to be so dangerous, but let’s see. Three games without training they did a great job. This victory is more for the players than the coach.\\\"\\n\\nUnited take on Arsenal away at the Emirates on Wednesday night.

He was really good defending and really good attacking.\\n\\n\\\"So he needs to continue to play like that. You could feel it at the end of the game he was really, really tired, so we need to manage that to increase physical ability.\\\"\\n\\nUnited scored early on in Amorim's first two games in charge but the 39-year-old refused to take too much credit for their fast starts. \\\"No, I’m just really, really lucky,\\\" he laughed.\\n\\n\\\"We want to play well because it’s better to start a game by scoring. If you look at the three games, all the decisive moments were for us. You have to acknowledge that.\\n\\n\\\"Today we started very well but lost the control of the game. We were following the ball without any possession after the 15 minutes, but then we score in the set-piece play, so that was a key point for us. And near half-time we scored again, and then we scored the third goal.\\n\\n\\\"So we must acknowledge that in the right moments in these three games we scored goals. On Thursday, we controlled the ball well but today we had some difficulties.\\n\\n\\\"After the 15 minutes and we had some possession just to keep the ball, not to be so dangerous, but let’s see.

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Player ratings vs Everton as Amad brilliant](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\\n\\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\\n\\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \\\"Five Cantonas\\\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\\n\\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\\n\\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\\n\\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \\\"Olé\\\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\\n\\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\\n\\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\\n\\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\\n\\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\\n\\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\\n\\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\\n\\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\\n\\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\\n\\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\\n\\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Player ratings vs Everton as Amad brilliant](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\\n\\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\\n\\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \\\"Five Cantonas\\\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\\n\\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\\n\\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\\n\\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \\\"Olé\\\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\\n\\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\\n\\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\\n\\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\\n\\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\\n\\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\\n\\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\\n\\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\\n\\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\\n\\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\\n\\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Player ratings vs Everton as Amad brilliant](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\\n\\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\\n\\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \\\"Five Cantonas\\\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\\n\\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\\n\\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\\n\\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \\\"Olé\\\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\\n\\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\\n\\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\\n\\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\\n\\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\\n\\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\\n\\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\\n\\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\\n\\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\\n\\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\\n\\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Branthwaite skulked off at half-time with his head bowed, tugging his shirt in the hope it would be big enough to conceal his embarrassed expression. There was a half left to play yet Everton were done.\\n\\n[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were otherwise unconvincing in a first half so troubling that Ruben Amorim was plotting a double substitution at half-time. Branthwaite's collapse caused his teammates to also fold. United ran away with it without running much.\\n\\nAfter two 3-0 reverses at Old Trafford, the thrashings are being meted out by the home side. There was a hearty and celebratory rendition of \\\"Amorim's Red and White Army\\\" from the Stretford End before the hour, with victory already assured. This was United's first four-goal victory in the Premier League since the opening day of the 2021-22 season.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Player ratings vs Everton as Amad brilliant](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United vs Everton reaction](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-vs-everton-live-30489781)**\\n\\nUnited are literally on the up. The three points have elevated them to the heady heights of ninth in the table, the first time they have been in the top half since October. Their goal difference is finally a positive figure.\\n\\nThe only anger vented by the matchgoers was over the callous ticket price hike by the Ineos cabal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Manchester roots have not spared him from the vitriol after spinning supporters a hollow working-class hero yarn.\\n\\nOn the pitch, Amorim had the luxury of introducing the returning Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw before the hour to grant Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui a breather. The festive season commenced with a cheery rendition of \\\"Five Cantonas\\\". In a week the other Manchester side squandered a hefty advantage with a quarter of an hour to play, there was no chance of Everton emulating Feyenoord.\\n\\nMarcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee got two goals apiece but the game belonged to Amad. He made three of the four possible and is the perfect profile of player for Amorim.\\n\\nIt was only nine months ago that Omari Forson (remember him?) started ahead of Amad. Amad's intensity and selflessness have enabled him to swiftly adapt to Amorim's demands. Forson has played three times for Monza.\\n\\nRashford's penchant for performing under a new manager (or head coach) has continued with the latest incumbent. His charge and spontaneous strike for United's third goal was reminiscent of his 2022-23 zenith. Rashford is one shy of matching his meagre eight-goal haul of last term.\\n\\nEverton ordered United to attack the Stretford End in the first half, as they had on their last two visits. Those fixtures ended 2-0. This time it was double that. United fans were \\\"Olé\\\"ing as early as the 75th minute.\\n\\nAmorim was more animated and impatient at 0-0 than on his previous appearances in the United technical area. He had to clap his hands to alert Casemiro to receive the ball, lamented a risk-aversive pass from De Ligt and in the 19th minute instructed Diogo Dalot to come yet he opted to go.\\n\\nBefore he scored, Zirkzee was berated for being out of position to press. It happened a second time moments later and Amorim reactively turned to the dugout and told Mason Mount and Alejandro Garnacho to warm up. That was in the 24th minute. They were not required at the interval after all.\\n\\nZirkzee was the third striker to start in Amorim's third match and all three have scored. Zirkzee favours a deeper role and initially had some joy avoiding duels with Branthwaite but once Everton seized the initiative his positioning began to irk Amorim. Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund, whose intense pressing resulted in a goal after 48 seconds against Bodo/Glimt, are polar opposites.\\n\\nStill, Zirkzee rallied to score his first United goal in 18 games for his second in 19. James Tarkowski's dithering defending charitably made another possible and Zirkzee's body language altered markedly.\\n\\nHis teammates were pleased as punch and he celebrated by pretending to fire a machine gun. He has some way to go to be considered a sharp shooter, though Zirkzee's deeper presence accelerated the attack for Rashford's clinical second goal.\\n\\nAmorim's wing-back strategy is starting to bear fruit. Amad forced the error from Branthwaite to make it 2-0 through an intense press and his recall effectively cements his status as a first-teamer again.\\n\\nAmad had earlier irked Amorim by scooping the ball wide from Zirkzee's pass yet he has demonstrated over his four years at United he is not lacking in resilience. He has three assists in two starts under Amorim.\\n\\nIt is a misconception Amad is one of Ten Hag's legacies when his first start under him came in May. There were only ten more and he has slotted in admirably into Amorim's challenging 3-4-3 formation.\\n\\nBranthwaite had crucially cut out a couple of early crosses before making more decisive contact with Rashford's half-volley to give United a fortuitous lead on 34 minutes. Branthwaite's intervention sent the ball in the opposite direction to the prone Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nEverton's followers were bullish for half an hour yet when the fourth goal went in, thousands trudged down the gangways to the nearest exit and boos soundtracked Sean Dyche's first round of substitutions. Former United captain Ashley Young departed to a standing ovation yet many in the Everton end did not applaud him.\\n\\nThey had scored fewer goals than United at kick-off and the inclusion of the ungainly Beto did not increase their prospects. At 0-0, he rolled the ball the wrong side of the net with their one sighter.\\n\\nBranthwaite put it into his own net.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and Everton fans had gathered outside [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) ahead of their [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) match today to protest against ticket price increases.\\n\\nUnited this week sparked fury when they announced a mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners.\\n\\nHundreds of Reds' fans congregated and unfurled a banner reading \\\"stop exploiting loyalty.\\\" A chorus of angry and abusive chants were aimed at both the Glazer family and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Football fans protest LIVE: Man United and Man City supporters join forces over ticket prices](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-protest-live-man-united-30490216)**\\n\\nAmidst the wall of noise and red smoke bombs, three young fans shuffled their way to the front. They were holding up a homemade cardboard sign which read: \\\"Man Utd - ripping off kids.\\\" An adult supporter ran over and pointed at them as the fans sang \\\"£66, you're taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s.\\\"\\n\\nStood not far from them was lifelong Red Ross Jenkins, 41, from Sale. On his shoulders sat his eight year-old son William. He too had a sign. \\\"It's my fault, so charge me more,\\\" it read.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491833.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4525jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nRoss Jenkins and son William\\n\\nRoss doesn't have a season-ticket, but is a long-term 'One United' member and attends games regularly with William and his brother.\\n\\nHowever, he said: \\\"Overnight we have been priced out of tickets. I accept some price increases will happen. But to remove a child's price is absolutely appalling.\\\"\\n\\nRoss said without concession prices, he would be unable to afford to take his kids to the match, and that if they couldn't go, he wouldn't either.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491840.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_007JPG.jpg)\\n\\nFans protested in front of the Trinity statue (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"It breaks your heart,\\\" he said. \\\"As a dad its one of things that you look forward to and relish doing. I've always been a big believer in bringing them to see football live, not just watching it on TV.\\n\\n\\\"And how is Manchester United going to be sustained without these young fans who are the future of the club? It's just so sad.\\\" \\\"If they can't go I won't be going,\\\" he added. \\\"'I'm also thinking of asking for a refund for my membership.\\\"\\n\\nAnthony Talbot, 49, and his 11-year-old son Finn, from [Wythenshawe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wythenshawe), have season tickets which are at this stage unaffected. However they said they believed all fans had to \\\"make a stand\\\" against the decision.\\n\\n\\\"They are taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s,\\\" Anthony said. \\\"They are forcing young and working class fans away from the club. For example, a dad who wants to bring his three kids, is looking at paying getting on towards 300 quid. That's before your travel, your food and everything else.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491551.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_013JPG.jpg)\\n\\nAnthony Talbot (centre right) and son Finn (right) at the protest (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"People just aren't going to be able to afford that. They are forcing supporters out. It's as if they just want the corporate fans in the ground and it will become lifeless.\\\"\\n\\nAlex Sinau, 42, from Northenden, who was at the game with ten-year-old son Eitan, said: \\\"It's terrible. I have a season ticket but I have to buy a ticket for my son. And it's a massive difference from like 15 pounds to 66.\\n\\n\\\"My daughter isn't interested in football yet, but if she did start wanting to come it's going to be so much money. I'm very angry. Instead of bringing young kids and the younger generation closer to football, they are pushing them away.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491845.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_016JPG.jpg)\\n\\nHundreds gathered to protest against the ticket price rises (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\nAnother banner, aimed at Failsworth-born Sir Jim Ratcliffe, read: \\\"Local lad Sir Jim charges £66 for OAPS+Juniors. Stop exploiting loyalty.\\\"\\n\\nFans sang \\\"Manchester boy, you're having a laugh\\\", \\\"you're not one us, you greedy \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\" at Sir Jim amongst chants deriding the Glazer family and urging them to fully sell the club.\\n\\nThe protest was organised by United fan group The 1958. Spokesman Steve Crompton told the _Manchester Evening News_ he reacted with \\\"utter disgust\\\" when he first heard of the planned price increases, which the club didn't consult on.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4528jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nThe 1958 group spokesman Steve Crompton\\n\\n\\\"It's an absolute disgrace. They have not consulted with anyone, they have just decided 'this is what we're going to do.' This must be Sir Jim Ratcliffe's way of 'putting the Manchester back into Manchester United.'\\n\\n\\\"I am going to assume he's a smart man, as he's made a bob or two during his life. He knew what we was getting on board with. If things are so bad he has to penalise match going fans like this, then it really is a shocking state of affairs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have spoken to three or four supporters clubs who are worried about closing,\\\" Steve continued. \\\"They rely on filling coaches to the game, and if they can't fill the coach because people can't afford tickets, then they will die. Match-going fans are being penalised, it's not on.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 8](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491846.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_IMG_4527jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nEverton fans Dave Kelly (left) and David Fehily (right)\\n\\nAsked if he thought the club may reverse their decision given the level of anger, Steve said: \\\"probably not.\\\" \\\"But will we keep fighting? Absolutely. This is the start, we are working with other Premier League teams. Unity is our strength and our voice will only get louder.\\\"\\n\\nEverton fan David Fehily, 61, and chair of the club's fan advisory board, Dave Kelly, 66, were among those of the Blue persuasion who came to show their support for the campaign spearheaded by The Football Supporters Association.\\n\\n\\\"We believe this isn't a club-by-club issue, this is a national issue\\\" David said. \\\"Everton is unusual as we have a high number of juniors and OAPs who this would affect.

[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and Everton fans had gathered outside [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) ahead of their [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) match today to protest against ticket price increases.\\n\\nUnited this week sparked fury when they announced a mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners.\\n\\nHundreds of Reds' fans congregated and unfurled a banner reading \\\"stop exploiting loyalty.\\\" A chorus of angry and abusive chants were aimed at both the Glazer family and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Football fans protest LIVE: Man United and Man City supporters join forces over ticket prices](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-protest-live-man-united-30490216)**\\n\\nAmidst the wall of noise and red smoke bombs, three young fans shuffled their way to the front. They were holding up a homemade cardboard sign which read: \\\"Man Utd - ripping off kids.\\\" An adult supporter ran over and pointed at them as the fans sang \\\"£66, you're taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s.\\\"\\n\\nStood not far from them was lifelong Red Ross Jenkins, 41, from Sale. On his shoulders sat his eight year-old son William. He too had a sign. \\\"It's my fault, so charge me more,\\\" it read.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491833.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4525jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nRoss Jenkins and son William\\n\\nRoss doesn't have a season-ticket, but is a long-term 'One United' member and attends games regularly with William and his brother.\\n\\nHowever, he said: \\\"Overnight we have been priced out of tickets. I accept some price increases will happen. But to remove a child's price is absolutely appalling.\\\"\\n\\nRoss said without concession prices, he would be unable to afford to take his kids to the match, and that if they couldn't go, he wouldn't either.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491840.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_007JPG.jpg)\\n\\nFans protested in front of the Trinity statue (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"It breaks your heart,\\\" he said. \\\"As a dad its one of things that you look forward to and relish doing. I've always been a big believer in bringing them to see football live, not just watching it on TV.\\n\\n\\\"And how is Manchester United going to be sustained without these young fans who are the future of the club? It's just so sad.\\\" \\\"If they can't go I won't be going,\\\" he added. \\\"'I'm also thinking of asking for a refund for my membership.\\\"\\n\\nAnthony Talbot, 49, and his 11-year-old son Finn, from [Wythenshawe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wythenshawe), have season tickets which are at this stage unaffected. However they said they believed all fans had to \\\"make a stand\\\" against the decision.\\n\\n\\\"They are taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s,\\\" Anthony said. \\\"They are forcing young and working class fans away from the club. For example, a dad who wants to bring his three kids, is looking at paying getting on towards 300 quid. That's before your travel, your food and everything else.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491551.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_013JPG.jpg)\\n\\nAnthony Talbot (centre right) and son Finn (right) at the protest (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"People just aren't going to be able to afford that. They are forcing supporters out. It's as if they just want the corporate fans in the ground and it will become lifeless.\\\"\\n\\nAlex Sinau, 42, from Northenden, who was at the game with ten-year-old son Eitan, said: \\\"It's terrible. I have a season ticket but I have to buy a ticket for my son. And it's a massive difference from like 15 pounds to 66.\\n\\n\\\"My daughter isn't interested in football yet, but if she did start wanting to come it's going to be so much money. I'm very angry. Instead of bringing young kids and the younger generation closer to football, they are pushing them away.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491845.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_016JPG.jpg)\\n\\nHundreds gathered to protest against the ticket price rises (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\nAnother banner, aimed at Failsworth-born Sir Jim Ratcliffe, read: \\\"Local lad Sir Jim charges £66 for OAPS+Juniors. Stop exploiting loyalty.\\\"\\n\\nFans sang \\\"Manchester boy, you're having a laugh\\\", \\\"you're not one us, you greedy \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\" at Sir Jim amongst chants deriding the Glazer family and urging them to fully sell the club.\\n\\nThe protest was organised by United fan group The 1958. Spokesman Steve Crompton told the _Manchester Evening News_ he reacted with \\\"utter disgust\\\" when he first heard of the planned price increases, which the club didn't consult on.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4528jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nThe 1958 group spokesman Steve Crompton\\n\\n\\\"It's an absolute disgrace. They have not consulted with anyone, they have just decided 'this is what we're going to do.' This must be Sir Jim Ratcliffe's way of 'putting the Manchester back into Manchester United.'\\n\\n\\\"I am going to assume he's a smart man, as he's made a bob or two during his life. He knew what we was getting on board with. If things are so bad he has to penalise match going fans like this, then it really is a shocking state of affairs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have spoken to three or four supporters clubs who are worried about closing,\\\" Steve continued. \\\"They rely on filling coaches to the game, and if they can't fill the coach because people can't afford tickets, then they will die. Match-going fans are being penalised, it's not on.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 8](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491846.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_IMG_4527jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nEverton fans Dave Kelly (left) and David Fehily (right)\\n\\nAsked if he thought the club may reverse their decision given the level of anger, Steve said: \\\"probably not.\\\" \\\"But will we keep fighting? Absolutely. This is the start, we are working with other Premier League teams.

[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and Everton fans had gathered outside [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) ahead of their [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) match today to protest against ticket price increases.\\n\\nUnited this week sparked fury when they announced a mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners.\\n\\nHundreds of Reds' fans congregated and unfurled a banner reading \\\"stop exploiting loyalty.\\\" A chorus of angry and abusive chants were aimed at both the Glazer family and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Football fans protest LIVE: Man United and Man City supporters join forces over ticket prices](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-protest-live-man-united-30490216)**\\n\\nAmidst the wall of noise and red smoke bombs, three young fans shuffled their way to the front. They were holding up a homemade cardboard sign which read: \\\"Man Utd - ripping off kids.\\\" An adult supporter ran over and pointed at them as the fans sang \\\"£66, you're taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s.\\\"\\n\\nStood not far from them was lifelong Red Ross Jenkins, 41, from Sale. On his shoulders sat his eight year-old son William. He too had a sign. \\\"It's my fault, so charge me more,\\\" it read.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491833.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4525jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nRoss Jenkins and son William\\n\\nRoss doesn't have a season-ticket, but is a long-term 'One United' member and attends games regularly with William and his brother.\\n\\nHowever, he said: \\\"Overnight we have been priced out of tickets. I accept some price increases will happen. But to remove a child's price is absolutely appalling.\\\"\\n\\nRoss said without concession prices, he would be unable to afford to take his kids to the match, and that if they couldn't go, he wouldn't either.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491840.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_007JPG.jpg)\\n\\nFans protested in front of the Trinity statue (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"It breaks your heart,\\\" he said. \\\"As a dad its one of things that you look forward to and relish doing. I've always been a big believer in bringing them to see football live, not just watching it on TV.\\n\\n\\\"And how is Manchester United going to be sustained without these young fans who are the future of the club? It's just so sad.\\\" \\\"If they can't go I won't be going,\\\" he added. \\\"'I'm also thinking of asking for a refund for my membership.\\\"\\n\\nAnthony Talbot, 49, and his 11-year-old son Finn, from [Wythenshawe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wythenshawe), have season tickets which are at this stage unaffected. However they said they believed all fans had to \\\"make a stand\\\" against the decision.\\n\\n\\\"They are taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s,\\\" Anthony said. \\\"They are forcing young and working class fans away from the club. For example, a dad who wants to bring his three kids, is looking at paying getting on towards 300 quid. That's before your travel, your food and everything else.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491551.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_013JPG.jpg)\\n\\nAnthony Talbot (centre right) and son Finn (right) at the protest (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"People just aren't going to be able to afford that. They are forcing supporters out. It's as if they just want the corporate fans in the ground and it will become lifeless.\\\"\\n\\nAlex Sinau, 42, from Northenden, who was at the game with ten-year-old son Eitan, said: \\\"It's terrible. I have a season ticket but I have to buy a ticket for my son. And it's a massive difference from like 15 pounds to 66.\\n\\n\\\"My daughter isn't interested in football yet, but if she did start wanting to come it's going to be so much money. I'm very angry. Instead of bringing young kids and the younger generation closer to football, they are pushing them away.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491845.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_016JPG.jpg)\\n\\nHundreds gathered to protest against the ticket price rises (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\nAnother banner, aimed at Failsworth-born Sir Jim Ratcliffe, read: \\\"Local lad Sir Jim charges £66 for OAPS+Juniors. Stop exploiting loyalty.\\\"\\n\\nFans sang \\\"Manchester boy, you're having a laugh\\\", \\\"you're not one us, you greedy \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\" at Sir Jim amongst chants deriding the Glazer family and urging them to fully sell the club.\\n\\nThe protest was organised by United fan group The 1958. Spokesman Steve Crompton told the _Manchester Evening News_ he reacted with \\\"utter disgust\\\" when he first heard of the planned price increases, which the club didn't consult on.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4528jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nThe 1958 group spokesman Steve Crompton\\n\\n\\\"It's an absolute disgrace. They have not consulted with anyone, they have just decided 'this is what we're going to do.' This must be Sir Jim Ratcliffe's way of 'putting the Manchester back into Manchester United.'\\n\\n\\\"I am going to assume he's a smart man, as he's made a bob or two during his life. He knew what we was getting on board with. If things are so bad he has to penalise match going fans like this, then it really is a shocking state of affairs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have spoken to three or four supporters clubs who are worried about closing,\\\" Steve continued. \\\"They rely on filling coaches to the game, and if they can't fill the coach because people can't afford tickets, then they will die. Match-going fans are being penalised, it's not on.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 8](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491846.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_IMG_4527jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nEverton fans Dave Kelly (left) and David Fehily (right)\\n\\nAsked if he thought the club may reverse their decision given the level of anger, Steve said: \\\"probably not.\\\" \\\"But will we keep fighting? Absolutely. This is the start, we are working with other Premier League teams. Unity is our strength and our voice will only get louder.\\\"\\n\\nEverton fan David Fehily, 61, and chair of the club's fan advisory board, Dave Kelly, 66, were among those of the Blue persuasion who came to show their support for the campaign spearheaded by The Football Supporters Association.\\n\\n\\\"We believe this isn't a club-by-club issue, this is a national issue\\\" David said. \\\"Everton is unusual as we have a high number of juniors and OAPs who this would affect. We have to stand together.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim praises Ruud van Nistelrooy after Manchester United 4-0 win vs

[Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and Everton fans had gathered outside [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) ahead of their [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) match today to protest against ticket price increases.\\n\\nUnited this week sparked fury when they announced a mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners.\\n\\nHundreds of Reds' fans congregated and unfurled a banner reading \\\"stop exploiting loyalty.\\\" A chorus of angry and abusive chants were aimed at both the Glazer family and new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Football fans protest LIVE: Man United and Man City supporters join forces over ticket prices](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/football-protest-live-man-united-30490216)**\\n\\nAmidst the wall of noise and red smoke bombs, three young fans shuffled their way to the front. They were holding up a homemade cardboard sign which read: \\\"Man Utd - ripping off kids.\\\" An adult supporter ran over and pointed at them as the fans sang \\\"£66, you're taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s.\\\"\\n\\nStood not far from them was lifelong Red Ross Jenkins, 41, from Sale. On his shoulders sat his eight year-old son William. He too had a sign. \\\"It's my fault, so charge me more,\\\" it read.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491833.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4525jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nRoss Jenkins and son William\\n\\nRoss doesn't have a season-ticket, but is a long-term 'One United' member and attends games regularly with William and his brother.\\n\\nHowever, he said: \\\"Overnight we have been priced out of tickets. I accept some price increases will happen. But to remove a child's price is absolutely appalling.\\\"\\n\\nRoss said without concession prices, he would be unable to afford to take his kids to the match, and that if they couldn't go, he wouldn't either.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491840.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_007JPG.jpg)\\n\\nFans protested in front of the Trinity statue (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"It breaks your heart,\\\" he said. \\\"As a dad its one of things that you look forward to and relish doing. I've always been a big believer in bringing them to see football live, not just watching it on TV.\\n\\n\\\"And how is Manchester United going to be sustained without these young fans who are the future of the club? It's just so sad.\\\" \\\"If they can't go I won't be going,\\\" he added. \\\"'I'm also thinking of asking for a refund for my membership.\\\"\\n\\nAnthony Talbot, 49, and his 11-year-old son Finn, from [Wythenshawe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wythenshawe), have season tickets which are at this stage unaffected. However they said they believed all fans had to \\\"make a stand\\\" against the decision.\\n\\n\\\"They are taking the p\\\\*\\\\*s,\\\" Anthony said. \\\"They are forcing young and working class fans away from the club. For example, a dad who wants to bring his three kids, is looking at paying getting on towards 300 quid. That's before your travel, your food and everything else.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491551.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_013JPG.jpg)\\n\\nAnthony Talbot (centre right) and son Finn (right) at the protest (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\n\\\"People just aren't going to be able to afford that. They are forcing supporters out. It's as if they just want the corporate fans in the ground and it will become lifeless.\\\"\\n\\nAlex Sinau, 42, from Northenden, who was at the game with ten-year-old son Eitan, said: \\\"It's terrible. I have a season ticket but I have to buy a ticket for my son. And it's a massive difference from like 15 pounds to 66.\\n\\n\\\"My daughter isn't interested in football yet, but if she did start wanting to come it's going to be so much money. I'm very angry. Instead of bringing young kids and the younger generation closer to football, they are pushing them away.\\\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491845.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JRP_MEN_011224_protest_016JPG.jpg)\\n\\nHundreds gathered to protest against the ticket price rises (Image: Jason Roberts /Manchester Evening News)\\n\\nAnother banner, aimed at Failsworth-born Sir Jim Ratcliffe, read: \\\"Local lad Sir Jim charges £66 for OAPS+Juniors.

Spokesman Steve Crompton told the _Manchester Evening News_ he reacted with \\\"utter disgust\\\" when he first heard of the planned price increases, which the club didn't consult on.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30491843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_4528jpeg.jpg)\\n\\nThe 1958 group spokesman Steve Crompton\\n\\n\\\"It's an absolute disgrace. They have not consulted with anyone, they have just decided 'this is what we're going to do.' This must be Sir Jim Ratcliffe's way of 'putting the Manchester back into Manchester United.'\\n\\n\\\"I am going to assume he's a smart man, as he's made a bob or two during his life.

The win moved Ruben Amorim's team back into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table, just four points behind [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) in fifth who lost 2-0 at [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nAs we have become accustomed to following victories, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) players took to Instagram at full-time to celebrate the victory. [Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) posted: \\\"Top team performance,\\\" while captain [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) added: \\\"A nice Sunday at home.\\\"\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sancho has just left Amorim another warning](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jadon-sancho-just-left-ruben-30484841)**\\n\\nBoth posts were liked by [Sancho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho) despite him being on loan at Premier League rivals [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc). The winger joined the London club with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.\\n\\nAt the time, Sancho's relationship with then-manager [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) remained frosty. Despite the Dutchman insisting that he had buried the hatchet with the English winger, the consensus at United was that he would be better off leaving.\\n\\nAfter starting well at Stamford Bridge, Sancho's form did drop but a good performance at Heidenheim in the Conference League earned him a start against Aston Villa this weekend. The United loanee played 71 minutes as Enzo Maresca's side ran out 3-0 winners while the Reds were picking up three points.\\n\\nSancho's future at Chelsea will be confirmed at the end of the season with United banking £25m in the deal.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the

The win moved Ruben Amorim's team back into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table, just four points behind [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) in fifth who lost 2-0 at [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nAs we have become accustomed to following victories, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) players took to Instagram at full-time to celebrate the victory.

The United loanee played 71 minutes as Enzo Maresca's side ran out 3-0 winners while the Reds were picking up three points.\\n\\nSancho's future at Chelsea will be confirmed at the end of the season

The win moved Ruben Amorim's team back into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table, just four points behind [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) in fifth who lost 2-0 at [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nAs we have become accustomed to following victories, [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) players took to Instagram at full-time to celebrate the victory. [Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) posted: \\\"Top team performance,\\\" while captain [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) added: \\\"A nice Sunday at home.\\\"\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Sancho has just left Amorim another warning](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jadon-sancho-just-left-ruben-30484841)**\\n\\nBoth posts were liked by [Sancho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho) despite him being on loan at Premier League rivals [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc). The winger joined the London club with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.\\n\\nAt the time, Sancho's relationship with then-manager [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) remained frosty. Despite the Dutchman insisting that he had buried the hatchet with the English winger, the consensus at United was that he would be better off leaving.\\n\\nAfter starting well at Stamford Bridge, Sancho's form did drop but a good performance at Heidenheim in the Conference League earned him a start against Aston Villa this weekend. The United loanee played 71 minutes as Enzo Maresca's side ran out 3-0 winners while the Reds were picking up three points.\\n\\nSancho's future at Chelsea will be confirmed at the end of the season with United banking £25m in the deal.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Amad sends eight-word Man United message after Ruben Amorim makes Ruud van Nistelrooy

The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The result moved United up into the top half of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and ensured Amorim secured two wins from his first week in the dugout.\\n\\nIn his opening three games, the forward players have been responsible for all of United's goals with Rashford having three to his name, [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and Zirkzee having two each and Alejandro Garnacho bagging one too. This is a drastic change following the [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) era which saw United struggle to score most matchdays.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim praises Van Nistelrooy after 4-0 win](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-praises-ruud-van-30491923)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim makes Rashford claim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-makes-marcus-rashford-30492463)**\\n\\n[Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) picked up on this when asked for his thoughts on Sky Sports following Manchester City's defeat to [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) in the Premier League. \\\"Do you know what, the fact they have scored four goals again today and the strikers are scoring goals \\\\[is impressive\\\\],\\\" he told the Super Sunday panel.\\n\\n\\\"Whatever the problems [Man United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) have had over the last year or so, they have not been scoring goals so four today against Everton... Everton defensively were all over the place and gave away huge mistakes.\\n\\n\\\"But the attacking players are scoring goals and that is a big boost for United on the back of scoring three goals in Europe. So yeah, a big plus for United today.\\\"\\n\\nAmorim will hope this positive momentum will continue in midweek when United face the tough trip to in-form Arsenal on Wednesday night. A victory in North London would move the Reds to within three points of the Gunners.\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The game was suspended after 25 minutes with Bove stretchered off and taken to hospital.\\n\\nDe Gea, who joined the Italian side over the summer and has played 10 times in Serie A alongside Bove, started the game. [He was among those who were extremely worried on the field after Bove fell to the ground.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fiorentina-vs-inter-suspended-david-30492772)\\n\\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \\\"God Please (prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\\n\\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\\n\\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\\n\\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nFellow ex-Manchester United star Paul Pogba was among others to offer their support. \\\"Forza @edo\\\\_bove \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\" he wrote on his Instagram story with a blank background. Former [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) striker Mario Balotelli did the same. He wrote: \\\"@edo\\\\_bove Prego di rivederti così al più presto Ti abbraccio forte \\\\[bicep emoji\\\\]\\\", which translates as, \\\"I pray to see you again as soon as possible I hug you tightly.\\\"\\n\\nRomelu Lukaku and Tammy Abraham, who were both at Roma last season but now play at Napoli and AC Milan respectively, have also posted to their Instagram stories for Bove.\\n\\nBove has played 11 league games for La Viola this season, winning the last seven he has started alongside De Gea. The pair have only failed to win twice when playing together, only one was a defeat.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The game was suspended after 25 minutes with Bove stretchered off and taken to hospital.\\n\\nDe Gea, who joined the Italian side over the summer and has played 10 times in Serie A alongside Bove, started the game. [He was among those who were extremely worried on the field after Bove fell to the ground.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fiorentina-vs-inter-suspended-david-30492772)\\n\\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \\\"God Please (prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\\n\\n> God Please\\n> \\n> — David de Gea (@D\\\\_DeGea) [December 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/D_DeGea/status/1863280599382864244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\\n\\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\\n\\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nFellow ex-Manchester United star Paul Pogba was among others to offer their support. \\\"Forza @edo\\\\_bove \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\" he wrote on his Instagram story with a blank background. Former [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) striker Mario Balotelli did the same. He wrote: \\\"@edo\\\\_bove Prego di rivederti così al più presto Ti abbraccio forte \\\\[bicep emoji\\\\]\\\", which translates as, \\\"I pray to see you again as soon as possible I hug you tightly.\\\"\\n\\nRomelu Lukaku and Tammy Abraham, who were both at Roma last season but now play at Napoli and AC Milan respectively, have also posted to their Instagram stories for Bove.\\n\\nBove has played 11 league games for La Viola this season, winning the last seven he has started alongside De Gea. The pair have only failed to win twice when playing together, only one was a defeat.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Fiorentina vs Inter suspended as David de Gea teammate Edoardo Bove

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nWriting on X (formerly Twitter), De Gea said, \\\"God Please (prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\". Players were taken from the pitch by the referee after Bove was removed from the stadium.\\n\\nA group of medical staff and members of both teams formed a wall to block any view of Bove during the distressing incident. Some were left in tears and putting their hands on their head and over their eyes.\\n\\nIt has been reported in Italy that Bove is breathing on his own in hospital. The game has since been abandoned and will be rescheduled.\\n\\nBove, 22, is on loan from Roma and joined Fiorentina over the summer like De Gea. The ex-United shot-stopper moved to Italy as a free agent after not finding a club upon his exit from [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nThe Serie A X account also posted a message to Bove. It wrote: \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of the player. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image 64](https://cdn.convrse.media/images/mantis-recommender/mantisLogoNew.png)\\n\\n[![Image 65: 'Money is always available' -

He has to continue to improve.\\n\\n\\\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \\\"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus \\\\[Hojlund\\\\], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \\\"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\\\" said Amorim about potential [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) qualification.\\n\\n\\\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results. We’ll see in the end. I’ve said this many times, I will be judged on where we finish, I know that, but let’s focus on the next game and look at the performance.\\n\\n\\\"On Thursday, it was a 3-2 and I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 but I thought Everton deserved more. Let’s focus on the performance, congratulations to the lads, let’s rest, recover and think about Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He has to continue to improve.\\n\\n\\\"He has the ability to do that but he can play so much better, like the other guys. It was a good performance, tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nZirkzee also scored twice on Sunday and Amorim discussed his display. \\\"First thing, I need all the players to cope with all the games and he’s one of them. I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus \\\\[Hojlund\\\\], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.\\\"\\n\\nUnited's win against Everton moved them into the top half of the table. \\\"I understand that it’s hard for me to say no because you would say I can’t be a [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) coach, but I want to be honest with our fans,\\\" said Amorim about potential [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) qualification.\\n\\n\\\"So let’s focus on the performance and not the results. We’ll see in the end. I’ve said this many times, I will be judged on where we finish, I know that, but let’s focus on the next game and look at the performance.\\n\\n\\\"On Thursday, it was a 3-2 and I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 but I thought Everton deserved more. Let’s focus on the performance, congratulations to the lads, let’s rest, recover and think about Arsenal.\\\"\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

I just try to put my players in good positions for their characteristics,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"It would have been really hard, even for Rasmus \\\\[Hojlund\\\\], to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton, so we try and push them to a position that they weren’t so comfortable and Josh did a great job.\\n\\n\\\"He scored two goals, which is always important for the confidence. But more important than that was his performance because he fought in every situation.

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) goalkeeper started the match before it had to be suspended.\\n\\nBove, 22, fell to the ground early on with players and medical staff rushing to his aid. A wall of bodies was formed to protect the Italian from being visible.\\n\\nPlay was officially stopped by the referee 10 minutes after Bove went down. Some of those on the field were left in tears at the disturbing scenes.\\n\\nBove was taken to hospital after being stretched off the field, lead directly into a pitchside ambulance. Both sets of players went down the tunnel shortly after with play being cut short.\\n\\nIt is reported that the player bent down to tie his laces before collapsing. Nobody is said to have been around him when it happened.\\n\\nInter posted online to signal that the game had been suspended due to a medical emergency. No official statement from the league has been issued as of yet, although the Serie A X(formerly Twitter) account wrote, \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of Bove. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nDe Gea also sent a message to Bove. He wrote on X, \\\"God Please \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\".\\n\\nThe young midfielder is on loan from Roma and has played 11 league games for Fiorentina this season. 10 of those have featured De Gea after he was picked up on a free contract earlier this year following his departure from Manchester United.\\n\\nFiorentina have won eight of the games with De Gea and Bove on the pitch, losing the first and drawing another. The pair have been victorious in each of their previous seven heading into the match with Inter.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) goalkeeper started the match before it had to be suspended.\\n\\nBove, 22, fell to the ground early on with players and medical staff rushing to his aid. A wall of bodies was formed to protect the Italian from being visible.\\n\\nPlay was officially stopped by the referee 10 minutes after Bove went down. Some of those on the field were left in tears at the disturbing scenes.\\n\\nBove was taken to hospital after being stretched off the field, lead directly into a pitchside ambulance. Both sets of players went down the tunnel shortly after with play being cut short.\\n\\nIt is reported that the player bent down to tie his laces before collapsing. Nobody is said to have been around him when it happened.\\n\\nInter posted online to signal that the game had been suspended due to a medical emergency. No official statement from the league has been issued as of yet, although the Serie A X(formerly Twitter) account wrote, \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of Bove. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nDe Gea also sent a message to Bove. He wrote on X, \\\"God Please \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\".\\n\\nThe young midfielder is on loan from Roma and has played 11 league games for Fiorentina this season. 10 of those have featured De Gea after he was picked up on a free contract earlier this year following his departure from Manchester United.\\n\\nFiorentina have won eight of the games with De Gea and Bove on the pitch, losing the first and drawing another. The pair have been victorious in each of their previous seven heading into the match with Inter.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [David De Gea breaks silence after Edoardo Bove collapse as Fiorentina vs

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) goalkeeper started the match before it had to be suspended.\\n\\nBove, 22, fell to the ground early on with players and medical staff rushing to his aid. A wall of bodies was formed to protect the Italian from being visible.\\n\\nPlay was officially stopped by the referee 10 minutes after Bove went down. Some of those on the field were left in tears at the disturbing scenes.\\n\\nBove was taken to hospital after being stretched off the field, lead directly into a pitchside ambulance. Both sets of players went down the tunnel shortly after with play being cut short.\\n\\nIt is reported that the player bent down to tie his laces before collapsing. Nobody is said to have been around him when it happened.\\n\\nInter posted online to signal that the game had been suspended due to a medical emergency. No official statement from the league has been issued as of yet, although the Serie A X(formerly Twitter) account wrote, \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of Bove. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nDe Gea also sent a message to Bove. He wrote on X, \\\"God Please \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\".\\n\\nThe young midfielder is on loan from Roma and has played 11 league games for Fiorentina this season. 10 of those have featured De Gea after he was picked up on a free contract earlier this year following his departure from Manchester United.\\n\\nFiorentina have won eight of the games with De Gea and Bove on the pitch, losing the first and drawing another. The pair have been victorious in each of their previous seven heading into the match with Inter.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [David De Gea breaks silence after Edoardo Bove collapse as Fiorentina vs

The former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) goalkeeper started the match before it had to be suspended.\\n\\nBove, 22, fell to the ground early on with players and medical staff rushing to his aid. A wall of bodies was formed to protect the Italian from being visible.\\n\\nPlay was officially stopped by the referee 10 minutes after Bove went down. Some of those on the field were left in tears at the disturbing scenes.\\n\\nBove was taken to hospital after being stretched off the field, lead directly into a pitchside ambulance. Both sets of players went down the tunnel shortly after with play being cut short.\\n\\nIt is reported that the player bent down to tie his laces before collapsing. Nobody is said to have been around him when it happened.\\n\\nInter posted online to signal that the game had been suspended due to a medical emergency. No official statement from the league has been issued as of yet, although the Serie A X(formerly Twitter) account wrote, \\\"Forza Edo. Siamo con te!\\\" alongside an image of Bove. It translates to: \\\"Come on Edo. We are with you!\\\"\\n\\nDe Gea also sent a message to Bove. He wrote on X, \\\"God Please \\\\[prayer hands emoji\\\\]\\\".\\n\\nThe young midfielder is on loan from Roma and has played 11 league games for Fiorentina this season. 10 of those have featured De Gea after he was picked up on a free contract earlier this year following his departure from Manchester United.\\n\\nFiorentina have won eight of the games with De Gea and Bove on the pitch, losing the first and drawing another. The pair have been victorious in each of their previous seven heading into the match with Inter.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [David De Gea breaks silence after Edoardo Bove collapse as Fiorentina vs

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends clear message to Ruben Amorim after Man United demand](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends Arsenal warning ahead of Man United clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \\\"We keep going,\\\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\\\" alongside a love heart emoji.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\\n\\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he is also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\\\"\\n\\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) matches so far this season.\\n\\n\\\"It was far from a perfect performance,\\\" Amorim added. \\\"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends clear message to Ruben Amorim after Man United demand](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends Arsenal warning ahead of Man United clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \\\"We keep going,\\\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\\\" alongside a love heart emoji.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\\n\\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he is also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\\\"\\n\\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) matches so far this season.\\n\\n\\\"It was far from a perfect performance,\\\" Amorim added. \\\"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends clear message to Ruben Amorim after Man United demand](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends Arsenal warning ahead of Man United clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \\\"We keep going,\\\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\\\" alongside a love heart emoji.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\\n\\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size.

The Ivorian, who was handed another Premier League start by Ruben Amorim, grabbed two assists against the Toffees on Sunday.\\n\\nAfter being involved in both of United's first two goals, Amad added his first assist just after half-time. He dribbled at the Everton back-line before feeding through Marcus Rashford, who slotted beyond Jordan Pickford.\\n\\nIt felt as though the 22-year-old started to go through the gears from that point and he produced another piece of magic to put United 4-0 ahead. Amad won the ball back inside the Everton half before sliding a pass into Joshua Zirkzee, who made no mistake and tucked home into the bottom corner.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends clear message to Ruben Amorim after Man United demand](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Marcus Rashford sends Arsenal warning ahead of Man United clash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/marcus-rashford-immediately-responds-ruben-30491674)**\\n\\nAfter the game, Amad took to Instagram to send a message to the United supporters following the thumping win over Everton. He said in a caption: \\\"We keep going,\\\" followed by a flexed biceps emoji. Thanks fans for the support,\\\" alongside a love heart emoji.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Amad has improved this season and Amorim, who was appointed as the new United head coach on November 1, has since hailed Ruud van Nistelrooy for helping the winger. Van Nistelrooy won three of his four matches as interim head coach after the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but left his position on November 11 with Amorim deciding to recruit his own backroom staff.\\n\\nSpeaking in a post-match interview, Amorim told BBC's Match of the Day: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he is also has to improve. He is a great moment. Ruud van Nistelrooy helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he's helping me.\\\"\\n\\nThe win for United has moved them up to ninth, four points off the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) places. They have won five, drawn four and lost four of their 13 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) matches so far this season.\\n\\n\\\"It was far from a perfect performance,\\\" Amorim added. \\\"We have to improve, you can feel that in the game. After 15 minutes Everton controlled the game and it was difficult for us and we were losing the second ball. I felt that the players could solve some problems that we have as a team because of the quality that they have but it was far from a perfect performance but a really good result and tough match.\\\"\\n\\n### Try MUFC Pro NOW for free\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article28556125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_app-comp.jpg)\\n\\nSubscribe to our brilliant app for the best way to enjoy the M.E.N's unrivalled Manchester United coverage.\\n\\n*   No adverts, pop-ups or distractions - just our brilliant content presented in the best way possible.\\n*   Comprehensive, round-the-clock coverage of the Reds, with agenda-setting breaking news and insight from Samuel Luckhurst and our authoritative team of United writers\\n*   Exclusive content for subscribers\\n*   New interactive elements including (coming soon) quizzes to test your United knowledge.\\n\\n**__Try MUFC Pro for a front-row seat to the action at absolutely no cost for the first month.

Shortly before the interval, Zirkzee had his first of the afternoon firing home on the edge of the area after Amad won the ball high up the pitch.\\n\\nIn the second half, Rashford netted his brace and [Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) followed closely afterwards with a calm finish into the bottom corner. While it was good for United to see the English striker move on to seven for the season, it was particularly pleasing to see Zirkzee find his feet.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim handed huge double blow ahead of Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-handed-huge-double-30491567)**\\n\\nAfter being signed by [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) and not impressing in front of goal, there had been speculation that Zirkzee could be surplus to requirements so soon into his United career. But, getting a start under Amorim and scoring twice will undoubtedly boost his confidence.\\n\\nFollowing the match both [De Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and [Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) sent messages to the striker.

Shortly before the interval, Zirkzee had his first of the afternoon firing home on the edge of the area after Amad won the ball high up the pitch.\\n\\nIn the second half, Rashford netted his brace and [Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) followed closely afterwards with a calm finish into the bottom corner. While it was good for United to see the English striker move on to seven for the season, it was particularly pleasing to see Zirkzee find his feet.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim handed huge double blow ahead of Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-handed-huge-double-30491567)**\\n\\nAfter being signed by [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) and not impressing in front of goal, there had been speculation that Zirkzee could be surplus to requirements so soon into his United career. But, getting a start under Amorim and scoring twice will undoubtedly boost his confidence.\\n\\nFollowing the match both [De Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and [Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) sent messages to the striker. His Dutch teammate posted a fire emoji alongside a picture of the pair celebrating to which [Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) replied with a love heart.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Maguire wrote: \\\"Love it,\\\" accompanied by clapping emojis to which Zirkzee replied: \\\"Big man.\\\" After such a good performance, Amorim now has a selection headache ahead of the midweek trip to [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc).\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Harry Maguire and Joshua Zirkzee converse after Manchester United's

Shortly before the interval, Zirkzee had his first of the afternoon firing home on the edge of the area after Amad won the ball high up the pitch.\\n\\nIn the second half, Rashford netted his brace and [Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) followed closely afterwards with a calm finish into the bottom corner. While it was good for United to see the English striker move on to seven for the season, it was particularly pleasing to see Zirkzee find his feet.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim handed huge double blow ahead of Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-handed-huge-double-30491567)**\\n\\nAfter being signed by [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) and not impressing in front of goal, there had been speculation that Zirkzee could be surplus to requirements so soon into his United career.

While it was good for United to see the English striker move on to seven for the season, it was particularly pleasing to see Zirkzee find his feet.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [United player ratings vs Everton](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30490967)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim handed huge double blow ahead of Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-handed-huge-double-30491567)**\\n\\nAfter being signed by [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) and not impressing in front of goal, there had been speculation that Zirkzee could be surplus to requirements so soon into his United career. But, getting a start under Amorim and scoring twice will undoubtedly boost his confidence.\\n\\nFollowing the match both [De Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and [Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) sent messages to the striker. His Dutch teammate posted a fire emoji alongside a picture of the pair celebrating to which [Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) replied with a love heart.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Maguire wrote: \\\"Love it,\\\" accompanied by clapping emojis to which Zirkzee replied: \\\"Big man.\\\" After such a good performance, Amorim now has a selection headache ahead of the midweek trip to [Arsenal](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc).\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Harry Maguire and Joshua Zirkzee converse after Manchester United's

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Shortly afterwards, Hojlund enjoyed a purple patch and United's unbeaten streak suddenly ended in the first game that he was unavailable with injury.\\n\\nThat didn't feel like a coincidence, although Hojlund didn't return from his injury in the same vein of form and Bruno Fernandes started as the false nine in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\\n\\nIt was a disappointing end to the campaign for Hojlund, who subsequently struggled for Denmark at Euro 2024 and picked up a hamstring injury in his first appearance of pre-season.\\n\\nHojlund made his comeback against [Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in September. He later scored against FC Porto and Brentford, but he was beginning to look like a player whose confidence was suffering and that's why it was so great to see him net a brace in the Europe League on Thursday night.\\n\\nAlejandro Garnacho scored the opening goal against Bodo/Glimt but Hojlund created it with his aggressive pressing and his equaliser on the stroke of half-time was brilliantly taken.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: Rasmus Hojlund](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article30476684.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2187360958.jpg)\\n\\nThere is more to come from Hojlund.\\n\\nHojund's touch to control Noussair Mazraoui's cross was superb and the finish was even better. It was tremendous goal from a technical perspective and his second goal was a 'proper striker's goal', with Hojlund sweeping home Mason Mount's low, driven cross from close range.\\n\\nThe smile was back on Hojlund's face when he spoke to MUTV to reflect on the performance and he described his matchwinner in the second half as the perfect \\\"Rasmus Hojlund goal.\\\"\\n\\nThere is now a strong case for Hojlund to retain his starting role against Everton this weekend and history has a tendency to repeat itself, so he could be on the verge of a purple patch again.\\n\\nConfidence is crucial in elite sport and strikers can be streaky creatures who go on a prolific run after a strong performance, just like Hojlund did at the start of the year. After scoring a brace on Boxing Day, Hojlund exploded into life and perhaps lightening could strike twice.\\n\\nRuben Amorim said about Hojlund in his press conference: \\\"I think he improved the connection. I think he has to improve more because sometimes he gives too many touches when he holds the ball.\\n\\n\\\"But he’s really important for us because when we are in the low block he is the guy to hold the ball, to connect for transitions, he did that very well and he has that characteristic.\\n\\n\\\"He was aggressive in the goals, he was aggressive in the box and he is a quality player. I think he scores the most difficult goals so he has a lot to improve. Is the same for every player but he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nHojlund said when conducting his media duties that Amorim's system suits him because he played in a similar formation with Atalanta and the pair could develop a healthy marriage.\\n\\nUnited need Hojlund to score regularly and it feels like he's about to turn a corner again.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\\n\\n[Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\\n\\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\\n\\n[Argyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/wayne-rooney-plymouth-argyle-reaction-9750748) have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \\\"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\\\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \\\"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\\\"\\n\\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \\\"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\\\"\\n\\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \\\"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\\\"\\n\\nAnother fan agrees: \\\"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\\\"\\n\\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.\\n\\n**Have your say! What should Wayne Rooney's path towards being a top manager look like? Do you think he can do it?

The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\\n\\n[Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\\n\\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\\n\\n[Argyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/wayne-rooney-plymouth-argyle-reaction-9750748) have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \\\"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\\\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \\\"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\\\"\\n\\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \\\"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\\\"\\n\\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \\\"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\\\"\\n\\nAnother fan agrees: \\\"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\\\"\\n\\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.\\n\\n**Have your say! What should Wayne Rooney's path towards being a top manager look like? Do you think he can do it?

The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\\n\\n[Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\\n\\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\\n\\n[Argyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/wayne-rooney-plymouth-argyle-reaction-9750748) have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \\\"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\\\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \\\"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\\\"\\n\\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \\\"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\\\"\\n\\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \\\"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\\\"\\n\\nAnother fan agrees: \\\"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\\\"\\n\\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.\\n\\n**Have your say! What should Wayne Rooney's path towards being a top manager look like? Do you think he can do it?

The struggle continues at his new club, Plymouth Argyle in the Championship - where his side hover over the drop zone.\\n\\n[Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) began his move from player to head coach at Derby County in 2020, quitting professional football the following year. Hit with a 21 point deduction and spending almost the whole season with the club in administration, there was little to do but go down fighting.\\n\\nHis next English effort was with Birmingham City, and he was sacked in a season that saw Blues slip into League One for the first time since 1995. Plymouth Argyle took a chance on Rooney as the 2023/'24 season came to a close, and he has overseen some devastating losses during his time at the club.\\n\\n[Argyle fans on our sister site Plymouth Live](https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/sport/football/wayne-rooney-plymouth-argyle-reaction-9750748) have been having their say in comments sections as the drab results continue to come in. One fan wrote: \\\"Not holding my breath. Can't see a win coming at the next game. Another loss and Rooney should be up the road.\\\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \\\"Just resign Wayne, you dont have the solution and even if you did you couldn't implement it. So just go before you take our beloved club back to League 1, a league we tried to get out of for years.\\\"\\n\\nNot all think it's solely down to Rooney - Plymouth are amongst the lowest spenders in the Championship. One fan says: \\\"How on earth can the gaffer be blamed when Argyle have a budget lower than most league one clubs! Running a club in the Championship on a League 2 budget will only end one way... relegation.\\\"\\n\\nOn reader thinks that the deal should never have gone ahead: \\\"The board will never stand up and be counted, to say all of this is their fault.\\\"\\n\\nAnother fan agrees: \\\"Maybe the board should make a reaction.\\\"\\n\\nRooney's Plymouth have amassed 17 points from 18 games in the Championship, with 4 wins, 9 losses and 7 draws to their name. They've shipped 38 goals, the worst in the league.\\n\\n**Have your say! What should Wayne Rooney's path towards being a top manager look like? Do you think he can do it?

But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

United recovered from 2-1 down to secure all three points, inspired by a [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) brace.\\n\\nAmorim will now be keen to oversee his first [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) victory as United boss after his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road last weekend finished in a 1-1 draw.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Chido Obi-Martin marks landmark United moment by scoring again for Under-18s](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chido-obi-martin-marks-landmark-30487111)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\nUnited will fancy their chances of getting the better of an Everton side that has won just one of six away league games this season. But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them.

United recovered from 2-1 down to secure all three points, inspired by a [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) brace.\\n\\nAmorim will now be keen to oversee his first [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) victory as United boss after his debut in the dugout against Ipswich Town at Portman Road last weekend finished in a 1-1 draw.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Chido Obi-Martin marks landmark United moment by scoring again for Under-18s](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chido-obi-martin-marks-landmark-30487111)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim could unleash new midfield vs Everton to give United fans what they want](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-could-unleash-new-30486680)**\\n\\nUnited will fancy their chances of getting the better of an Everton side that has won just one of six away league games this season. But how do the pundits think the contest will unfold at Old Trafford?\\n\\n**Chris Sutton - BBC Sport**\\n\\n\\\"I think the reality is hitting home about Amorim using his favoured 3-4-3 formation with their current squad - especially with Christian Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield,\\\" Sutton told [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce89x1d34zko). \\\"As for Everton, well a fair few of their fans still seem to be on Sean Dyche's back, and they could not find a way past Brentford's 10 men last week.\\n\\n\\\"This time, they will be the team looking to hold out and I believe they can do it because this United team is going to take a while to click. Once the initial buzz of Amorim's first home game dies down, things could go flat at Old Trafford, the way it has done quite a lot recently.\\n\\n\\\"I hope it happens for them under Amorim because he seems like a decent guy, but he is in the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) madhouse now and he is about to find out what it is like to be under the microscope every single week.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 1-1 Everton_\\n\\n**Paul Merson - Sportskeeda**\\n\\nMerson, penning his prediction for [Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-paul-merson-predicts-liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-gw13-fixtures), wrote: \\\"Nothing changed for Manchester United last week, in my opinion. Ipswich were by far the better team.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not entirely convinced about Manchester United's new system under Amorim. After a point in that game, you would've thought Ipswich were the bigger club and not United – that's how it went.\\n\\n\\\"You could say everyone was away on international duty and he did not have enough time. But if that performance were against one of the big boys in the league, Manchester United would have been destroyed by four or five goals.\\n\\n\\\"Everton are a team who have a special X-factor in them. They always have that one fixture every season when they just spring to life and surprise us. I'm going for a United win, but I can't help but admit that I have a sneaky feeling about Everton.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-0 Everton_\\n\\n**Mark Lawrenson - Paddy Power**\\n\\nEverton can't stop drawing and they're certainly not scoring much,\\\" Lawrenson told [Paddy Power](https://news.paddypower.com/football/2024/11/30/football-accumulator-tips-footyaccums-best-bets-today-saturday/). \\\"With home advantage and the crowd behind them in Ruben Amorim's first game at Old Trafford Manchester United should win this.\\\"\\n\\n**Prediction:** _United 2-1 Everton_\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Never. He wouldn't! I don't want to talk about this!\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nMoments later, when the cameras cut back to the Sky Sports studio, presenter David Jones asked Carragher for his take on Salah's comments.\\n\\nThe former [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) centre-back would then reference [Roy Keane's bust-up with an Ipswich Town fan](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/roy-keane-man-utd-ipswich-fan-incident-887466-20241125) last week and joked that he would arrange to meet Salah \\\"in the carpark\\\" after he called him out.\\n\\nAnd shortly after, Carragher took to X, formerly Twitter, to add more fuel to the fire.\\n\\nResponding to a video of the post-match interview, he replied: \\\"I would’ve give it to VVD to be fair!\\\" – in reference to Salah being awarded the Player of the Match by co-commentator Gary Neville, who had the final say.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, Carragher has recently criticised [Salah](https://www.sportbible.com/mo-salah) for publicly speculating about his future.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nLast weekend, after scoring twice in the 3-2 win over Southampton at St Mary's, Salah revealed that he is yet to receive a contract offer ahead of his deal expiring at the end of the season.\\n\\n\\\"We are almost in December and I haven't received any offers yet to stay in the club,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I'm probably more out than in. You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\\\"\\n\\nCarragher responded to the interview by saying he was \\\"very disappointed\\\" at those comments. \\\"That interview yesterday, Liverpool have got Real Madrid midweek and they’ve got Manchester City at the weekend. That’s the story for Liverpool right now,\\\" he added.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"The most important thing is Liverpool winning the Premier League - that is more important than any of those players.

He was so focused on everything, I think he did a great job.\\\"\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nNow, the Portuguese coach has praised Diallo further but instead of taking all the credit, he pointed in the direction of former interim manager Van Nistelrooy, who [recently took the job at Leicester City](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-leicester-city-premier-league-439229-20241129).\\n\\nSpeaking in his post-match press conference, [Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) said: \\\"He is really big in talent, but small in size. He did a great job but he is also has to improve.\\\"\\n\\nThe 39-year-old continued: \\\"‘He was really good again. [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.sportbible.com/ruud-van-nistelrooy) helped him a lot in his games in charge and now he’s helping me. He’s in a great moment, but that moment started with Ruud.

Image credit: Getty\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nAmorim wasn't done there. \\\"He was really good defending and really good attacking so he has to continue to play like that,\\\" he added. \\\"You could feel it in the end of the game he was really, really tired so we have to manage that and increase his physical ability.\\n\\n\\\"I’d like to take credit for it \\\\[Amad’s pressing\\\\], but that’s him. He’s like that. He’s smart.

player did not make the squad – and they think his time at the club could be up.**\\n\\n[Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/ruben-amorim-man-utd-premier-league-goncalo-gregorio-195555-20241119), 39, was greeted with a warm reception for his first Premier League home game in charge of [United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united).\\n\\nAs ever, fans were keen to see his team selection and were surprised when [Joshua Zirkzee started ahead of Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/manchester-utd-joshua-zirkzee-rasmus-hojlund-ruben-amorim-selection-289882-20241201), who scored twice in the 3-2 win

20-man squad for the fixture against Everton, which will no doubt add to the speculation regarding his future.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nEriksen is out of contract at the end of the season.\\n\\nAnd according to [Sky Germany](https://x.com/Plettigoal/status/1862785765152809391)’s Florian Plettenberg, United are not willing to offer him a new deal – meaning he could leave as a free agent next summer.\\n\\n![Image 1: Christian Eriksen could leave Man United this summer

Eriksen could leave Man United this summer (Credit:Getty)\\n\\nThe 32-year-old has been linked with a potential move to Scottish champions Celtic, but his hefty wages (£150,000 per week, according to [Capology](https://www.capology.com/player/christian-eriksen-33648/)) could be a sticking point in any negotiations.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nHowever, fans on social media leapt to the former Inter man’s defence with some even arguing that he had been United’s ‘best player’ so far this season.\\n\\nOne said: “No Eriksen in the squad is an absolute joke. He’s been our best player this season.”\\n\\nAnother added: “Eriksen has been arguably our player of the season but Amorim hardly includes him in our match day squad. Why?”\\n\\nA third commented: “Can’t believe i’m saying this in 2025 - but we need to play Eriksen.”\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nWhile a fourth gave a different take: “I can't wait to see Manuel Ugarte replace Casemiro. Ugarte-Mainoo is the midfield pairing I want to see. Has the physical capability which the likes of Eriksen and Casemiro lack.”\\n\\nPowered By\\n\\n10 Sec\\n\\nConor McGregor reveals the proudest achievement of his

happy to send you some reminders\\n\\nClick '**OK**' then '**Allow**' to enable notifications\\n\\nNot nowOK\\n\\n**A former housemate of a Chelsea star has revealed how the player almost saw his opportunity to play in the Premier League slip away from him.**\\n\\nAccording to the [Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-news-nicolas-jackson-villarreal-34209249), Iker Goujan, a professional footballer who currently does not have a club, was “inseparable” from the Blues man.\\n\\nGoujan and the now [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) player lived together for two years as the pairing both played for Spanish outfit Villarreal.\\n\\nThe Spaniard explained how he formed a friendship with [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) forward [Nicolas Jackson](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/chelsea/nicolas-jackson-goal-wolves-john-obi-mikel-255782-20240825) after he ‘accidentally’ got the Senegal international sent off in a Villarreal B game.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nGoujan hurled a chair from the bench during the celebration of a 3-2 win over UCAM Murcia, but it was Jackson who was mistakenly shown a red card by the referee – since this, the 25-year-old has felt ‘forever in debt’ to Jackson.\\n\\nThe winger also revealed how he witnessed Jackson’s first opportunity to secure a move to the Premier League slip away from him.\\n\\nGoujon believes the incident summed up the striker’s determination to get to the elite level of the game.\\n\\n![Image 1: Nicolas Jackson has impressed this term

Jackson has impressed this term (Credit:Getty)\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nThe report explained how he was driving the forward to the airport ahead of a proposed £20.3m to AFC Bournemouth in January 2023 when Jackson received a WhatsApp message notifying him that the deal had collapsed.\\n\\nGoujan was there to pick Jason up upon his return to Spain, but the forward remained determined, saying, “Now I need to work harder than ever to earn the opportunity again.\\\"\\n\\nJackson continued to work hard, scoring 13 goals in 38 appearances for Villarreal in his final season at the club.\\n\\nOf course, it’s fair to say the failed move was a blessing in disguise as just six months later, Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea signed Jackson for a reported fee of £32m, according to [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66007461).\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nDespite the Argentine departing in the summer, new boss Enzo Maresca has shown faith in Jackson, and so far this season, the forward has been in fine form – scoring Premier League goals in 12 games.\\n\\nHis impressive tally currently puts him sixth in the overall goalscoring chart for the 2024/25 season.\\n\\nJackson has also added assists to his came, setting up three goals for his teammates.\\n\\n![Image 2: comment bubble](https://www.sportbible.com/_next/static/media/comment-bubble.c94d2633.svg)0

Prices, which previously started at £40 for adults and £25 for children, were raised to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners. The move comes as part of the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s efforts to make United more financially sustainable in the face of losses.\\n\\nFans outside the ground called the move 'unethical' and directed a number of chants at the ownership. Some Everton supporters also joined their United counterparts while Manchester City and Liverpool fans staged their own protest at Anfield in solidarity to support the Football Supporters' Association's 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty' campaign.\\n\\n*   [**Manchester United raise member ticket prices to £66 and remove concessions**](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/manchester-united-raise-member-ticket-prices-remove-concessions)\\n    \\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\\n\\nAmorim says he will be ‘judged on the place we finish’ at Manchester United\\n===========================================================================\\n\\n*   Manager wants to focus on performance not results\\n*   Amorim says Rashford ‘can play so much better’\\n\\nRuben Amorim has said he will be judged on Manchester United’s finishing position after [Sunday’s 4-0 defeat of Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report) lifted them to 19 points, four behind Brighton in the final Champions League berth.\\n\\nTwo goals each from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee gave the Portuguese victory in his first home league match and afterwards he was asked if [Champions League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague) qualification is realistic.\\n\\n[Rashford and Zirkzee double up as Manchester United dismantle Everton Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\n“I will be judged \\\\[on\\\\] the place that we finish. If I said no you will say that I cannot be a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager,” said the 39-year-old. “I want to be honest with our fans – so let’s focus on the performance, not the results. Let’s focus just on the next game and look at the performance. Thursday \\\\[against Bodø/Glimt\\\\] it was 3-2, but I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 – but I think Everton deserved \\\\[more\\\\]. So let’s focus on the performance.”\\n\\nOn Friday Amorim said that [Rashford has to really want to improve](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/marcus-rashford-has-to-really-want-it-to-return-to-top-form-says-ruben-amorim). He was asked if the display against Everton was an example. “Yeah. He can do so much,” said the manager. “He has to continue to improve, he has the ability to do it and he has already proved that. But he can play so much better, like the other guys, so it was a good performance. Tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal \\\\[on Wednesday\\\\].”\\n\\nZirkzee’s performance came after the striker had previously struggled for form. “First thing – I need all the players to cope with all the games and he is one of them,” said Amorim. “I just try to help my players, put them in a good position for their characteristics.”\\n\\nAmorim also explained why Zirkzee was preferred ahead of Rasmus Højlund, [who scored twice against Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-europa-league-match-report). “It would have been really hard for Rasmus to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton so we tried to push them to a position they are not so comfortable with,” he said. “Josh did a great job, scored two goals which is always important for the confidence, and more important than that is the performance and how he fought in every situation.

If I said no you will say that I cannot be a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager,” said the 39-year-old. “I want to be honest with our fans – so let’s focus on the performance, not the results. Let’s focus just on the next game and look at the performance. Thursday \\\\[against Bodø/Glimt\\\\] it was 3-2, but I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 – but I think Everton deserved \\\\[more\\\\]. So let’s focus on the performance.”\\n\\nOn Friday Amorim said that [Rashford has to really want to improve](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/marcus-rashford-has-to-really-want-it-to-return-to-top-form-says-ruben-amorim). He was asked if the display against Everton was an example. “Yeah. He can do so much,” said the manager. “He has to continue to improve, he has the ability to do it and he has already proved that. But he can play so much better, like the other guys, so it was a good performance. Tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal \\\\[on Wednesday\\\\].”\\n\\nZirkzee’s performance came after the striker had previously struggled for form. “First thing – I need all the players to cope with all the games and he is one of them,” said Amorim. “I just try to help my players, put them in a good position for their characteristics.”\\n\\nAmorim also explained why Zirkzee was preferred ahead of Rasmus Højlund, [who scored twice against Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-europa-league-match-report). “It would have been really hard for Rasmus to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton so we tried to push them to a position they are not so comfortable with,” he said. “Josh did a great job, scored two goals which is always important for the confidence, and more important than that is the performance and how he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.”\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester

If I said no you will say that I cannot be a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager,” said the 39-year-old. “I want to be honest with our fans – so let’s focus on the performance, not the results. Let’s focus just on the next game and look at the performance. Thursday \\\\[against Bodø/Glimt\\\\] it was 3-2, but I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 – but I think Everton deserved \\\\[more\\\\]. So let’s focus on the performance.”\\n\\nOn Friday Amorim said that [Rashford has to really want to improve](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/marcus-rashford-has-to-really-want-it-to-return-to-top-form-says-ruben-amorim). He was asked if the display against Everton was an example. “Yeah. He can do so much,” said the manager. “He has to continue to improve, he has the ability to do it and he has already proved that. But he can play so much better, like the other guys, so it was a good performance. Tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal \\\\[on Wednesday\\\\].”\\n\\nZirkzee’s performance came after the striker had previously struggled for form. “First thing – I need all the players to cope with all the games and he is one of them,” said Amorim. “I just try to help my players, put them in a good position for their characteristics.”\\n\\nAmorim also explained why Zirkzee was preferred ahead of Rasmus Højlund, [who scored twice against Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-europa-league-match-report). “It would have been really hard for Rasmus to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton so we tried to push them to a position they are not so comfortable with,” he said. “Josh did a great job, scored two goals which is always important for the confidence, and more important than that is the performance and how he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

If I said no you will say that I cannot be a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager,” said the 39-year-old. “I want to be honest with our fans – so let’s focus on the performance, not the results. Let’s focus just on the next game and look at the performance. Thursday \\\\[against Bodø/Glimt\\\\] it was 3-2, but I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 – but I think Everton deserved \\\\[more\\\\]. So let’s focus on the performance.”\\n\\nOn Friday Amorim said that [Rashford has to really want to improve](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/marcus-rashford-has-to-really-want-it-to-return-to-top-form-says-ruben-amorim). He was asked if the display against Everton was an example. “Yeah. He can do so much,” said the manager. “He has to continue to improve, he has the ability to do it and he has already proved that. But he can play so much better, like the other guys, so it was a good performance. Tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal \\\\[on Wednesday\\\\].”\\n\\nZirkzee’s performance came after the striker had previously struggled for form. “First thing – I need all the players to cope with all the games and he is one of them,” said Amorim. “I just try to help my players, put them in a good position for their characteristics.”\\n\\nAmorim also explained why Zirkzee was preferred ahead of Rasmus Højlund, [who scored twice against Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-europa-league-match-report). “It would have been really hard for Rasmus to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton so we tried to push them to a position they are not so comfortable with,” he said. “Josh did a great job, scored two goals which is always important for the confidence, and more important than that is the performance and how he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

If I said no you will say that I cannot be a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager,” said the 39-year-old. “I want to be honest with our fans – so let’s focus on the performance, not the results. Let’s focus just on the next game and look at the performance. Thursday \\\\[against Bodø/Glimt\\\\] it was 3-2, but I think we deserved more. Today was 4-0 – but I think Everton deserved \\\\[more\\\\]. So let’s focus on the performance.”\\n\\nOn Friday Amorim said that [Rashford has to really want to improve](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/marcus-rashford-has-to-really-want-it-to-return-to-top-form-says-ruben-amorim). He was asked if the display against Everton was an example. “Yeah. He can do so much,” said the manager. “He has to continue to improve, he has the ability to do it and he has already proved that. But he can play so much better, like the other guys, so it was a good performance. Tomorrow he has to recover and start thinking about Arsenal \\\\[on Wednesday\\\\].”\\n\\nZirkzee’s performance came after the striker had previously struggled for form. “First thing – I need all the players to cope with all the games and he is one of them,” said Amorim. “I just try to help my players, put them in a good position for their characteristics.”\\n\\nAmorim also explained why Zirkzee was preferred ahead of Rasmus Højlund, [who scored twice against Bodø/Glimt](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-europa-league-match-report). “It would have been really hard for Rasmus to fight with the two centre-backs of Everton so we tried to push them to a position they are not so comfortable with,” he said. “Josh did a great job, scored two goals which is always important for the confidence, and more important than that is the performance and how he fought in every situation. It was a good day for him and our team.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\\n\\nRashford and Zirkzee double up as Manchester United dismantle Everton\\n=====================================================================\\n\\n“Amorim, Ruben Amorim, nananananananaaa,” the jubilant [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) fans chorused after the impressive Joshua Zirkzee’s second goal. Sung to the melody of KC and the Sunshine Band’s Give It Up, this was the last thing the new manager’s players did: fail to go after any apparent lost cause in case gold could be mined.\\n\\nIt was how Zirkzee struck United’s fourth. From deep in his area, the substitute Luke Shaw headed out. The ball came to Amad Diallo, who rolled it along the right wing into space. Over thundered Marcus Rashford, who failed to connect but, when the ball was passed back to James Tarkowski, there was Diallo harrying. Everton’s captain dawdled, the right wing‑back pilfered possession, sprinted ahead, squared left to United’s centre-forward and he rammed home.\\n\\nAmorim explained beforehand why, after parachuting in with 11 [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague) games of the season gone, United are instantly playing his 3-4-3. “That would only postpone our problems,” the manager said, meaning that whatever is suffered short term would allow jam tomorrow.\\n\\n[Amorim says he will be ‘judged on the place we finish’ at Manchester United Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/i-will-be-judged-on-the-place-we-finish-ruben-amorim-realistic-over-champions-league-hopes-manchester-united)\\n\\nOn Sunday there was delight only. Rashford, too, scored twice, and though United were not perfect they were energetic and, just as vitally, up for what their new manager demands.\\n\\nThe No 10 said: “It wasn’t as easy as it looked today. Amad did well to counter-press for two of the goals. He’s so sharp and he’s always got the intent to push the other team back, with and without the ball. It is for the players to understand the strengths of other players so we can feed off each other.\\n\\n“He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] is definitely demanding but encouraging to bring your strengths into the game.

Sung to the melody of KC and the Sunshine Band’s Give It Up, this was the last thing the new manager’s players did: fail to go after any apparent lost cause in case gold could be mined.\\n\\nIt was how Zirkzee struck United’s fourth. From deep in his area, the substitute Luke Shaw headed out. The ball came to Amad Diallo, who rolled it along the right wing into space. Over thundered Marcus Rashford, who failed to connect but, when the ball was passed back to James Tarkowski, there was Diallo harrying. Everton’s captain dawdled, the right wing‑back pilfered possession, sprinted ahead, squared left to United’s centre-forward and he rammed home.\\n\\nAmorim explained beforehand why, after parachuting in with 11 [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague) games of the season gone, United are instantly playing his 3-4-3. “That would only postpone our problems,” the manager said, meaning that whatever is suffered short term would allow jam tomorrow.\\n\\n[![Image 3: Ruben Amorim signals to his players on the sidelines at Old Trafford](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82470bb8bef720670ae0c8d3d49480050faa8a52/0_42_2293_1375/master/2293.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93a40cabb7b841caa9a8d32e24397523) Amorim says he will be ‘judged on the place we finish’ at Manchester United Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/i-will-be-judged-on-the-place-we-finish-ruben-amorim-realistic-over-champions-league-hopes-manchester-united)\\n\\nOn Sunday there was delight only. Rashford, too, scored twice, and though United were not perfect they were energetic and, just as vitally, up for what their new manager demands.\\n\\nThe No 10 said: “It wasn’t as easy as it looked today. Amad did well to counter-press for two of the goals. He’s so sharp and he’s always got the intent to push the other team back, with and without the ball. It is for the players to understand the strengths of other players so we can feed off each other.\\n\\n“He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] is definitely demanding but encouraging to bring your strengths into the game. That is when you get a really good team performance.”\\n\\nAs the truism goes, the best coaches improve players, and Zirkzee may become Exhibit A of the Portuguese’s smarts if this performance is replicated weekly.

Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\\n\\nRashford and Zirkzee double up as Manchester United dismantle Everton\\n=====================================================================\\n\\n“Amorim, Ruben Amorim, nananananananaaa,” the jubilant [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) fans chorused after the impressive Joshua Zirkzee’s second goal. Sung to the melody of KC and the Sunshine Band’s Give It Up, this was the last thing the new manager’s players did: fail to go after any apparent lost cause in case gold could be mined.\\n\\nIt was how Zirkzee struck United’s fourth. From deep in his area, the substitute Luke Shaw headed out. The ball came to Amad Diallo, who rolled it along the right wing into space. Over thundered Marcus Rashford, who failed to connect but, when the ball was passed back to James Tarkowski, there was Diallo harrying. Everton’s captain dawdled, the right wing‑back pilfered possession, sprinted ahead, squared left to United’s centre-forward and he rammed home.\\n\\nAmorim explained beforehand why, after parachuting in with 11 [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague) games of the season gone, United are instantly playing his 3-4-3. “That would only postpone our problems,” the manager said, meaning that whatever is suffered short term would allow jam tomorrow.\\n\\n[![Image 3: Ruben Amorim signals to his players on the sidelines at Old Trafford](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82470bb8bef720670ae0c8d3d49480050faa8a52/0_42_2293_1375/master/2293.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93a40cabb7b841caa9a8d32e24397523) Amorim says he will be ‘judged on the place we finish’ at Manchester United Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/i-will-be-judged-on-the-place-we-finish-ruben-amorim-realistic-over-champions-league-hopes-manchester-united)\\n\\nOn Sunday there was delight only. Rashford, too, scored twice, and though United were not perfect they were energetic and, just as vitally, up for what their new manager demands.\\n\\nThe No 10 said: “It wasn’t as easy as it looked today. Amad did well to counter-press for two of the goals. He’s so sharp and he’s always got the intent to push the other team back, with and without the ball. It is for the players to understand the strengths of other players so we can feed off each other.\\n\\n“He \\\\[Amorim\\\\] is definitely demanding but encouraging to bring your strengths into the game. That is when you get a really good team performance.”\\n\\nAs the truism goes, the best coaches improve players, and Zirkzee may become Exhibit A of the Portuguese’s smarts if this performance is replicated weekly. The Dutchman’s nascent United career had already been questioned yet the offering on Sunday showed a fine technician, brave in receiving the ball despite knowing an ankle chopping was always incoming.\\n\\nIf Amorim’s three games in charge have bedded him to his on-field task, the fan protest [against the club’s ticket price hike](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/fans-at-old-trafford-and-anfield-to-coordinate-protests-against-ticket-prices) – to a minimum £66 for child or adult – offers the same for the surrounding, never-ending subplots of the United soap opera.\\n\\nHeld before kick-off at the Trinity statue, supporters’ ire was directed at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is responsible for the dizzying rise with junior admission having been £25. They urged the minority owner to “sell United and fuck off home” and informed him “we want our club back”. This was the polar opposite of the affection directed at Amorim as he oversaw what was a succession of chances from first kick to last.\\n\\n![Image 4: Marcus Rashford scores Manchester United’s third goal](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9cf34496a62bf9ed65ecce11bf24153e8902719/0_102_3646_2188/master/3646.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report#img-2)\\n\\nMarcus Rashford was back on form scoring a double for the first time since February 2023. Photograph: Molly Darlington/Reuters\\n\\nKobbie Mainoo, one of six changes, let fly at Jordan Pickford. Zirkzee, starting too for the first time under Amorim, dropped back to execute a sharp shoe-shuffle and sprayed the ball wide. Suddenly United were near the opposition area and we saw how Amorim-ball is designed to hurt.\\n\\nEverton were bogged down in the middle third as red shirts would crowd around, nick the ball and launch another raid. This was the pattern when Bruno Fernandes received on the left and struck a pass with the outside of his right boot. In ran Rashford whose attempted chip of an onrushing Pickford failed.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nMatthijs de Ligt also failed in an attempt at stopping the pacy Beto as he latched on to Dwight McNeil’s threaded pass. So the centre-back continued on, made himself a nuisance as Beto tried to round André Onana, and United escaped.\\n\\nEverton did not when Fernandes swung in a corner. A training ground routine, the ball was floated to Rashford, whose half‑volley appeared to be goalward before Jarrad Branthwaite stuck out a leg and deflected it past Pickford.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?\\n\\nShow\\n\\n*   Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.\\n*   If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.\\n*   In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.\\n*   Turn on sport notifications.\\n\\nZirkzee’s second goal for the club was a product of what might be named the “Amorim press” – Branthwaite, again, the patsy. This time he hesitated, Diallo rushed him, nabbed the ball, Fernandes took over and, entering Everton’s area, fed Zirkzee: the 6ft 4in striker surged forward to smash in a left-footed finish.\\n\\nThe same urgency was evident in United’s third that came after the second-half kick-off. The ball was played to Pickford, who hoofed upfield and Amorim’s men took over. Zirkzee collected and swivelled and passed to Diallo who rushed forward and fed the overlapping Rashford: an instant hit beat Pickford and that was his first double in United colours since February 2023.\\n\\nFernandes, one of Amorim’s five substitutions, later sat with an ice pack on his left foot. A worry for the captain and United but the wider picture suggests this was a fine day for the Amorim project: a victory of dominance in the 39-year-old’s first home league outing.\\n\\n#### \\n\\n####

Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left.

They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break.

Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min.

Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention.

After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block.

Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\\n\\n**87 min:** As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner.

Give them a couple of days off.\\n\\n**72 min:** Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it’ll make for a spicy denouement. They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min.

Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention.

He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block.

Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\\n\\n**87 min:** As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him.\\n\\nCole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that.\\n\\nCole Palmer that is a DISGRACE! What a goal!\\n\\n![Image 5: Cole Palmer scores for Chelsea](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17db976eb106442f2c83a48ebd0f0b0b556da6d/0_0_2955_1816/master/2955.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#img-4)\\n\\nCold. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\n**82 min:** Caicedo shows his worth by intercepting a Villa pass and then embarking on a direct run from box to box. Old school.\\n\\nHe feeds Palmer, who naturally doesn’t waste the ball, but wins a free-kick near the edge of the area.\\n\\n**But back to Ange-ball.** Two draws from winning positions in the week following the thrashing of City isn’t all that great. If indeed it finishes 1-1.\\n\\n“**I think everyone** talks about new manager bounce,” Everton’s Dyche said on Friday before facing [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) and their shiny new manager. “It’s more difficult in that way … they’ve got good players, I’m sure he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] has been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across.\\n\\n“I don’t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts.”\\n\\n**An email!** Entitled: “Reaction.”\\n\\n“Disbelief mixed with fear of the inevitable stoppage time Spurs winner,” writes Richard Hirst of Tottenham 1-1 [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) (latest score).\\n\\n“I’ve been a Fulham fan for 60 years - I have previous.”\\n\\n**74 min:** Emery sits on his airline-style seat with his hands plunged into his pockets and a puzzled look on his fact. How does he get his team out of this current malaise? How has their form fallen off a cliff like this? My expert opinion is that they look tired. Give them a couple of days off.\\n\\n**72 min:** Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it’ll make for a spicy denouement. They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min. Now Philogene and Rogers are off for Leon Bailey and Jhon Duran.\\n\\nAll square in north London.

According to the commentators, Fofana stood on the ball and injured himself in the process, although in the style of a certain former Arsenal gaffer, I didn’t see it.\\n\\n“**Yeah Luke**, but [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) 12 shots to Spurs’ six, and 10 corners to Spurs’ four,” fumes Richard Hirst. “Less about Ange-ball than Fulham’s customary inability to acquaint ball with net.”\\n\\n**54 min:** Sancho, who perhaps needless to say looks like an utterly different player to the [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) version, cuts in from the Chelsea left and sprints towards the box. Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez.\\n\\nGo Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong!

After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*   [Clockwatch](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/saturday-clockwatch)\\n*   [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united)\\n*   [Everton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/everton)\\n*   [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea)\\n*   [Aston Villa](https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa)\\n*   [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur)\\n*   [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham)\\n\\nShare\\n\\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffootball%2Flive%2F2024%2Fdec%2F01%2Fmanchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live&type=article&internalpagecode=football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live \\\"Reuse this content\\\")\\n\\nMore from Sports\\n----------------\\n\\nMore from Sports\\n----------------\\n\\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/peps-men-look-lost-as-his-once-impregnable-football-dynasty-falls-apart)\\n    \\n    ![Image 11](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5b8aa22dda218b14e1149fa80bcb1a7ea0567d/0_367_3374_2025/master/3374.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### Pep’s men look lost as Man City's once impregnable dynasty falls apart\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/mikaela-shiffrin-crash-injuries-skiing-killington)\\n    \\n    ![Image 12](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0843c91d1e5ffbc320e4a9936bcd73f6ad7b4250/151_0_6515_3912/master/6515.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    Skiing\\n    \\n    Shiffrin has deep puncture wound to abdomen after scary crash\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/30/michigan-ohio-state-fight-police-pepper-spray)\\n    \\n    ![Image 13](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/896fa9e13a24db6656c3e05c2ad6781a4fa91743/0_67_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    College football\\n    \\n    Police use pepper spray to break up brawl after Michigan stun No 2 Ohio State\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/max-verstappen-accuses-george-russell-of-trying-to-screw-him-over-at-qatar-gp)\\n    \\n    ![Image 14](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/708771ae7cf41d31e5c8cd34e0c1e8a075c10d3a/0_63_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    F1\\n    \\n    Verstappen accuses Russell of ‘trying to screw him over’ at Qatar GP\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/fiorentina-edoardo-bove-taken-to-hospital-after-collapsing-on-pitch-internazionale)\\n    \\n    ![Image 15](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51eb192bfaaa70b2386b75c28ecf3efad2bc9d2/0_954_5048_3029/master/5048.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    Soccer\\n    \\n    Fiorentina's Bove in intensive care after collapsing on field\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/emma-hayes-understands-booing-uswnt-korbin-albert-england)\\n    \\n    ![Image 16](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d5de6617fed361cf14e25e88d4f720b19756e8a/0_0_4484_2692/master/4484.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    USWNT\\n    \\n    Hayes understands England fans booing Albert after anti-LGBTQ+ post\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/01/chess-world-championship-gukesh-ding-game-6-updates)\\n    \\n    ![Image 17](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150786198c6d41cfd2ddaff5a782255b25000bca/0_136_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    World Chess Championship\\n    \\n    Another tight draw as Ding and Gukesh D battle for world title\\n    \\n*   [](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/30/san-jose-state-volleyball-mountain-west-tournament)\\n    \\n    ![Image 18](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62e342d00a49f8b1f53cc33e46277721ca29d5e1/0_119_3262_1957/master/3262.jpg?width=220&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n    \\n    ### \\n    \\n    College sports\\n    \\n    San Jose State’s volleyball season ends in MWC final amid gender controversy\\n    \\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\nMost viewed\\n-----------\\n\\n*   [Most viewed Across the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/tabs-popular-0)\\n*   [Most viewed in Football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/tabs-popular-1)\\n\\n### Most viewed Across the&nbsp;Guardian\\n\\n1.

Then he’s booked for a clumsy tackle.\\n\\n**87 min:** As I try to calm my nerves at what a good goal that was, and how brilliant Palmer has been in an all-round excellent [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) display, he is taken off to a standing ovation. Lavia and Palmer off, Gusto and Felix on.\\n\\n**Oh my word** that is a goal and a half. Having won the free-kick, it’s taken short. Madueke does well to wait for his moment and feed Palmer. “Cold” Palmer buys half a yard on the edge with a smart touch to his left. Having teed up the position and space for a shot, he wraps his left foot around the ball, calmly firing a curling, power-packed shot right into the top corner. Olsen is a mere spectator in goal as he watches the ball sail past him.\\n\\nCole Palmer is very very very good at football. And that is that.\\n\\nCole Palmer that is a DISGRACE! What a goal!\\n\\n![Image 5: Cole Palmer scores for Chelsea](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17db976eb106442f2c83a48ebd0f0b0b556da6d/0_0_2955_1816/master/2955.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/dec/01/manchester-united-v-everton-chelsea-v-aston-villa-and-more-premier-league-live#img-4)\\n\\nCold. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\n**82 min:** Caicedo shows his worth by intercepting a Villa pass and then embarking on a direct run from box to box. Old school.\\n\\nHe feeds Palmer, who naturally doesn’t waste the ball, but wins a free-kick near the edge of the area.\\n\\n**But back to Ange-ball.** Two draws from winning positions in the week following the thrashing of City isn’t all that great. If indeed it finishes 1-1.\\n\\n“**I think everyone** talks about new manager bounce,” Everton’s Dyche said on Friday before facing [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) and their shiny new manager. “It’s more difficult in that way … they’ve got good players, I’m sure he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] has been working with the players and trying to get his thoughts across.\\n\\n“I don’t know much of his work, other than stuff from the TV, stats and facts.”\\n\\n**An email!** Entitled: “Reaction.”\\n\\n“Disbelief mixed with fear of the inevitable stoppage time Spurs winner,” writes Richard Hirst of Tottenham 1-1 [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) (latest score).\\n\\n“I’ve been a Fulham fan for 60 years - I have previous.”\\n\\n**74 min:** Emery sits on his airline-style seat with his hands plunged into his pockets and a puzzled look on his fact. How does he get his team out of this current malaise? How has their form fallen off a cliff like this? My expert opinion is that they look tired. Give them a couple of days off.\\n\\n**72 min:** Villa have done next to nothing. But if they get a goal here it’ll make for a spicy denouement. They’ve just had one corner, and have forced another.\\n\\n**70 min:** Cole Palmer is just very good at football. He takes a pass with [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) looking to break. Instead of rushing things and making a hurried decision, he slows, takes an extra touch, and has a look to see what is on. Just like that, he clips a beautiful pass that curls into the path of Jackson, making a run down the Blues’ left.\\n\\nJackson then mucks up his own pass but still. Good run, good move. Maresca now takes Jackson off for Christopher Nkunku. Noni Madueke on for Sancho too.\\n\\n**67 min:** Changes for Villa. Firstly, Barkley on for Kamara, which was on 62 min. Now Philogene and Rogers are off for Leon Bailey and Jhon Duran.\\n\\nAll square in north London.

Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\\n\\n**64 min:** Thanks to Scott for the heads up on email. Martinez, the Villa goalie, was taken off at half time, which I missed while making a cup of tea. I believe he may have been injured after that howler which nearly handed a goal to Jackson. Robin Olsen is in nets for Villa.\\n\\nWowzers, United are BACK, baby!

According to the commentators, Fofana stood on the ball and injured himself in the process, although in the style of a certain former Arsenal gaffer, I didn’t see it.\\n\\n“**Yeah Luke**, but [Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) 12 shots to Spurs’ six, and 10 corners to Spurs’ four,” fumes Richard Hirst. “Less about Ange-ball than Fulham’s customary inability to acquaint ball with net.”\\n\\n**54 min:** Sancho, who perhaps needless to say looks like an utterly different player to the [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) version, cuts in from the Chelsea left and sprints towards the box. Again Villa just look tired as they try to cover the Chelsea moves. The ball makes its way to Palmer who tries a lovely little pass back into the path of Sancho, who perhaps didn’t quite read his teammate’s intention. The ball ends up in the grateful hands of Martinez.\\n\\nGo Tottenham! Go Ange-ball! I love being wrong!

Nothing less than they deserve against an off-form Aston Villa Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\n**35 min:** [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) are pushing. Villa are wobbling. Sancho buys a yard of space in the box and fires a shot goalwards but it’s high and wide. He has a word with the ref after, as if he wants a penalty, but his claim is waved away. Perhaps he got a little shove in the back but nothing major.\\n\\n**Manchester United**, presumably having won a second ball, take the lead via Marcus Rashford.\\n\\n**Tottenham** … 0  \\n[Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/fulham) … 0\\n\\n(latest score)\\n\\n**30 min:** Deary me! After claiming that cross from Neto, Martinez dallies with the ball having put it on the deck, looking to play a pass to a defender. He eventually plays a quite dreadful pass which is almost straight into the path of Jackson, who is trying to press the ball and be a nuisance. I say almost into the path, because it’s slightly behind the striker, but he still takes a touch towards goal, and Martinez dives desperately to block. That could have raised the comedy stakes considerably.\\n\\nExplore more on these topics\\n\\n*   [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague)\\n*

I love football hehe.”\\n\\nDon’t we all mate.\\n\\n**The live game** on a well-known sports broadcaster is Chelsea v [Aston Villa](https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa). I must say that after Tottenham v Roma on Thursday, the most entertaining game I’ve seen in ages, I’d rather watch Spurs v Fulham.\\n\\nBut as a wise person once said: “It is what it is.”\\n\\n**I could have sworn** Micah Richards just called his fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge “Dave”.

As far as His Majesty’s Premier League is concerned, kicking off at 1.30pm we have Chelsea v Aston Villa, Tottenham v Fulham and [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) v Everton.\\n\\nAnd it’s all LIVE right here, via frantically written and sarcastic text updates on the goals as they fly in.

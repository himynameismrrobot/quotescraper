We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge. However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\n_new Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality._\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag. Asked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing. \"I don’t know about repair,\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play. We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league,\" Amorim stated. \"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

We started very well but should have had more of the ball. But we are learning.\"\n\n**On adapting to his formation**: \"It was really hard for them, they were thinking what to do, it was not fluid which is normal after just two training sessions but they tried hard. They have so much space to improve. But after a draw you never feel the good things. So I am really happy because they tried but they can do so much better.\"\n\n**On the early goal**: \"We worked on that but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players.\"\n\n**On Noussair Mazraoui**: \"We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future.\"\n\n**On his first taste of the Premier League**: \"It is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same. You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games.\"\n\nRuben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge. However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, also drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\n_new Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says that while journalists and pundits may not think it is possible for the Red Devils to win the Premier League title under him in the future, he has full belief in himself, his staff and his players to make that dream a reality._\n\nThe former Sporting Lisbon manager arrived in Manchester on 11 November, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag. Asked where he thought he might need to \"repair\" the United squad, Amorim dismissed the suggestion his players needed fixing. \"I don’t know about repair,\" he replied. \"We have space to grow as a team. We have to improve in a lot of areas. I know it’s a different way of playing and we are changing the way we play. We have to change the physical aspect of the team. I don’t know how long it will take. I know at Manchester United we have to win games. We need a lot of time because it’s a tough league,\" Amorim stated. \"It's not revolution. The football is not so different with five at the back, four at the back, three at the back. It’s not evolution or revolution, it’s a change in the way we play football.\"\",\n            \"article_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n        },\n        \"quotes\": [\n            {\n                \"speaker_name\": \"Name of person quoted\",\n                \"raw_quote_text\": \"The exact quote from the text\",\n                \"summary\": \"A concise version of the quote\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n# START OF ARTICLE TEXT\n\n{article_text}\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n5.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

Andre Onana! Andre Onana!\\\" came from the Manchester United away end in the first half against Ipswich Town and it was the first time the chant had been audible.\\n\\nUnited fans often cursed Onana's name when they left games during his first few months in Manchester but they are now singing it. The goalkeeper has enjoyed an impressive turnaround in fortunes and has demonstrated grit, determination and quality to get where he currently is.\\n\\n[Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana) made five saves against Ipswich, with three of those coming inside the box, and the save to deny Liam Delap in the first half was the pick of the bunch. Onana did remarkably well to make himself big and close the angle, which saw Delap's point-blank-range shot hit his bicep.\\n\\nIt was after that save that Onana's name was sung. The 28-year-old has come a long way since struggling when he first signed from Inter Milan and deserved the fans' recognition.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [I spotted Amorim copying Guardiola vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spotted-ruben-amorim-copying-pep-30440344)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [United player ratings against Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\nThe turning point for Onana came during last winter. He ended last season strongly and hasn't looked back, continuing to improve in this season to become the team's best player on form.\\n\\nOnana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his outstanding double stop against Crystal Palace in September and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October.\\n\\nThe Cameroon international denied Youssef En-Nesyri twice in a matter of seconds as Fenerbahce threatened an equaliser in the Europa League. He got down to his left before springing back to his feet to make another save and Jose Mourinho described the saves as \\\"incredible\\\".\\n\\nOnana has been lavished with superlatives and nobody would have predicted that he would become United's best player in this campaign but that's exactly what has happened.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the bar isn't very high after a dismal start and the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but Onana has been the most consistent performer in the dressing room and keeps making important saves, so he deserves his flowers and it was great to heard his name chanted at Portman Road.\\n\\nIt's easy to forget that a broadcaster compiled a two-minute plus video of Onana's blunders in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/champions-league) in his first season, which included the ball trickling through his hands after a shot from Leroy Sane, Onana giving the ball away and conceding a penalty against Galatasaray at Old Trafford and the embarrassing moment when he let Hakim Ziyech's free-kick into the net.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441835.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185812638.jpg)\\n\\nOnana and Amad were the best players against Ipswich. (Image: Darren Staples/AFP via Getty Images.)\\n\\nOnana was a liability in that Champions League group stage and wasn't much better in the league, but he's gone from costing the team points to regularly saving them points.\\n\\nHe can be proud of his performances this season, although it's never a good sign when your goalkeeper is your best player and United must reduce how frequently he's called into action.\\n\\nUnited will improve following Ruben Amorim's appointment. Until then, Onana should continue to deliver each week and will grow in confidence because his popularity is soaring.\\n\\nSomeone who worked with Onana in training last season said he is \\\"so powerful and athletic\\\" and praised his \\\"aggressive movements\\\" in between the posts. United thought they were signing a world-class 'keeper in the summer of 2023 and Onana is slowly becoming that player.\\n\\nOnana must sustain his excellent performances over a longer period of time but he's one of the most in-form goalkeepers in the league and has eliminated mistakes from his game.\\n\\nDiogo Dalot was asked about Onana [in the mixed zone](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792) and said: \\\"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\\\"\\n\\nOnana is helping his teammates and United will move up the table when they return the favour.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United star reveals four instructions he received from 'demanding' Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-star-reveals-four-30441792?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United have a new contender for key Ruben Amorim role after tactical switch at Ipswich](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-best-player-202425-30444987#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444475.ece/alternates/s338a/1_JS352696441.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim is working on Manchester United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) is officially the new head coach at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and it remains to be seen if any new additions will be made to the squad this winter.\\n\\nAmorim's time as the club's new boss began on Sunday when United were held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\\n\\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet [A Bola](http://abola.pt/), the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\\n\\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\\n\\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future.

[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) is officially the new head coach at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and it remains to be seen if any new additions will be made to the squad this winter.\\n\\nAmorim's time as the club's new boss began on Sunday when United were held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\\n\\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet [A Bola](http://abola.pt/), the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\\n\\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\\n\\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future. Elsewhere, United are reportedly interested in signing Quenda's Sporting teammate, Ousmane Diomande.\\n\\nAccording to [Caught Offside](https://www.caughtoffside.com/2024/11/25/ruben-amorim-ousmane-diomande-transfer/), Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. The article claims that United will face competition from [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc), [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande.\\n\\nIt has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) is officially the new head coach at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and it remains to be seen if any new additions will be made to the squad this winter.\\n\\nAmorim's time as the club's new boss began on Sunday when United were held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\\n\\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet [A Bola](http://abola.pt/), the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\\n\\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\\n\\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future. Elsewhere, United are reportedly interested in signing Quenda's Sporting teammate, Ousmane Diomande.\\n\\nAccording to [Caught Offside](https://www.caughtoffside.com/2024/11/25/ruben-amorim-ousmane-diomande-transfer/), Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. The article claims that United will face competition from [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc), [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande.\\n\\nIt has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) is officially the new head coach at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and it remains to be seen if any new additions will be made to the squad this winter.\\n\\nAmorim's time as the club's new boss began on Sunday when United were held to a 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\\n\\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet [A Bola](http://abola.pt/), the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\\n\\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\\n\\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future. Elsewhere, United are reportedly interested in signing Quenda's Sporting teammate, Ousmane Diomande.\\n\\nAccording to [Caught Offside](https://www.caughtoffside.com/2024/11/25/ruben-amorim-ousmane-diomande-transfer/), Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. The article claims that United will face competition from [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc), [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande.\\n\\nIt has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\\n\\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim told to change Manchester United player's position after just one match](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-told-change-manchester-30447571?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim told to change Manchester United player's position after just one match](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-told-change-manchester-30447571?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-new-contender-key-30444877#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 4](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 6](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30449947.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186664265.jpg)\\n\\nRuben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\\n\\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Ruben Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**ALSO READ: [Amorim reveals what Amad improved in only three days of a training at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)**\\n\\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\\n\\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\\n\\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\\n\\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\\n\\n\\\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\\\"\\n\\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\\n\\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\\n\\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\\n\\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\\n\\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\\n\\nAmorim will be looking for that.

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories.

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-prepare-transfer-offer-30448056?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment2](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 8](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 9](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 12](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\\n\\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\\n\\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Amorim is working on United's three weaknesses with new warm-up drills](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-working-manchester-uniteds-30442813)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\\n\\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\\n\\nThere is that scene in _Moneyball_ where Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discuss cutting a player. \\\"They're professional ball players, be straight with them. No fluff, just facts,\\\" Pitt says. \\\"Would you rather get a bullet to the head or five to the chest and bleed to death?\\\" Watching Zirkzee on Sunday, his United career is becoming death by a thousand cuts. United have to cut him loose.\\n\\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \\\"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\\\" Amorim bluntly said.\\n\\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\\n\\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 4: £108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)\\n\\n£108.5m down the drain? Will Hojlund or Zirkzee score again?\\n\\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\\n\\nDan Ashworth was the sporting director at Newcastle when Isak arrived from Real Sociedad. Chris Wood, ousted by Isak, has got four times as many club goals as Hojlund this term.\\n\\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\\n\\nThat requires careful consideration. Maguire has played in nine of United's 19 games and has been sidelined for more than seven weeks with a calf problem. Maguire missed 17 games through injury last season, too.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 5: Maguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30235894.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2177084621.jpg)\\n\\nMaguire has not played since the goalless draw with Villa (Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images.)\\n\\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\\n\\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\\n\\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 6: Gyokeres: still scoring for Sporting](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30446108.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2185448934.jpg)\\n\\nGyokeres: still scoring for Sporting\\n\\nUnited will bank £20m or £25m next year when Chelsea are obliged to pay for the services of the flaky Jadon Sancho. A fit and firing left wing back is essential, so Tyrell Malacia or Luke Shaw have to go.\\n\\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\\n\\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-prepare-transfer-offer-30448056?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment2](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United Transfer News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 8](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 9](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30440763.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2186635567.jpg)\\n\\nMan United 'prepare transfer offer' for £83.5m star as Ruben Amorim targets reunion\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 12](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

If he has that type of mentorship, I'm sure there's a bright future ahead of him.\\\"\\n\\nGarnacho played 86 minutes at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon as he was used in an attacking midfield role by Amorim.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sergio-aguero-makes-man-united-30445126#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho)\\n*   [Sergio Aguero](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sergio-aguero)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park - Sky pundit had to stop Man United legend](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane)\\n\\n[A group of Ipswich fans were involved in a heated row with former Manchester United captain Roy Keane after the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw with the Red Devils](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Manchester United undroppable might need new role when £52m gem is finally unleashed](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[Noussair Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui)\\n\\n[Leny Yoro is getting closer to making his competitive debut for Man Utd and he will get plenty of opportunities in Ruben Amorim's back three.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-undroppable-might-need-30448761)\\n\\n[![Image 7](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

In the time between the sacking of Ten Hag and the arrival of Amorim, Garnacho started three of the four games during Ruud van Nistelrooy's time as interim manager.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**Amad improved something in only three days of training under Amorim**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-reveals-what-amad-30441823)\\n\\n**READ MORE:** [**'Stuck' - Amorim reveals the new instructions United players have**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stuck-ruben-amorim-explains-what-30441804)\\n\\nDespite putting up such impressive numbers during his two-and-a-half years in the United first-team, Garnacho has taken a fair bit of flack this season for some of his recent performances, especially during the back end of Ten Hag's time at the club.\\n\\nHowever, Aguero believes his compatriot is unfairly criticised at times and, in fact, many of his detractors forget just how old Garnacho actually is.\\n\\nSpeaking to [Stake.com](http://stake.com/), five-time [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) winner Aguero said: \\\"Sometimes, people forget how young Alejandro is. His raw talent got him to the Premier League at a young age, and he's proven his worth already.\\n\\n\\\"I've seen many of his teammates leaning in to help him develop as a pro player, and that's massive. If he has that type of mentorship, I'm sure there's a bright future ahead of him.\\\"\\n\\nGarnacho played 86 minutes at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon as he was used in an attacking midfield role by Amorim.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Mason Mount sends wordless Man United message after Ruben Amorim comments](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mason-mount-sends-wordless-man-30444885?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Luke Shaw shows true colours with message to former Man United teammate after 'long season'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luke-shaw-shows-true-colours-30438955?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sergio-aguero-makes-man-united-30445126#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho)\\n*   [Sergio Aguero](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sergio-aguero)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30444914.ece/alternates/s338a/0_GettyImages-2185782758.jpg)\\n\\nMason Mount sends wordless Man United message after Ruben Amorim comments\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)\\n\\n[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/raging-roy-keane-confronted-car-30444434)\\n\\n[Why raging Roy Keane confronted me in a car park -

Liverpool right now.\\n\\n“And Mo Salah, we’re all quite aware…that in the seven years he has been at the football club, he’s stopped in the mixed zone twice, which is his right, which is absolutely fine.\\n\\n“But he decided to stop for the third time away at Southampton on the back of winning Liverpool the game.”\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\nHowever, Carragher had seemingly given a less harsh view of the situation earlier in the broadcast and gave a considered take on what he felt the issue between both parties is.\\n\\n\\\"I think it's pretty obvious what the issue is what Mo Salah feels he's worth, whether that's in financial terms or length of contract is completely different to what Liverpool feel at this moment,\\\" explained Carragher.\\n\\nPowered By\\n\\n10 Sec\\n\\nJamie Carragher hits

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2\\n\\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTowards the end of the first half against [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united), Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n3\\n\\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s [scintillating performance at Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report) ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\\\[Ange Postecoglou\\\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n4\\n\\nHope for Saints in latest loss\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. **Simon Burnton**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Southampton 2-3 Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 9: Liverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13a95aea34f8c943e51b3e6f217ea5c48b4a9d5c/0_332_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-2)\\n\\nLiverpool’s Andrew Robertson holds the shirt of Southampton’s Tyler Dibling.

When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up [Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report); Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n6\\n\\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Leicester 1-2 Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n7\\n\\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention [for Wolves at Fulham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report). If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Fulham 1-4 Wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n8\\n\\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, [against Villa on Saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report). His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Aston Villa 2-2 Crystal Palace](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n![Image 10: Justin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d940e8809ad76a471a6998f9dc7e24b899d2a6d1/0_108_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action#img-3)\\n\\nJustin Devenny shoots past Youri Tielemans to score Crystal Palace’s second goal at Aston Villa.

Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up [two goals against Bournemouth](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report), the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Bournemouth 1-2 Brighton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter [a third match without a goal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report), and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men. More work is required to end the status quo. **Andy Hunter**\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   _Match report: [Everton 0-0 Brentford](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report)_\\n    \\n\\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Liverpool | 12 | 16 | 31 |\\n| 2 | Man City | 12 | 5 | 23 |\\n| 3 | Chelsea | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 4 | Arsenal | 12 | 9 | 22 |\\n| 5 | Brighton | 12 | 5 | 22 |\\n| 6 | Tottenham Hotspur | 12 | 14 | 19 |\\n| 7 | Nottm Forest | 12 | 2 | 19 |\\n| 8 | Aston Villa | 12 | 0 | 19 |\\n| 9 | Newcastle | 11 | 2 | 18 |\\n| 10 | Fulham | 12 | 0 | 18 |\\n| 11 | Brentford | 12 | 0 | 17 |\\n| 12 | Man Utd | 12 | 0 | 16 |\\n| 13 | AFC Bournemouth | 12 | \\\\-1 | 15 |\\n| 14 | West Ham | 11 | \\\\-6 | 12 |\\n| 15 | Everton | 12 | \\\\-7 | 11 |\\n| 16 | Leicester | 12 | \\\\-8 | 10 |\\n| 17 | Wolverhampton | 12 | \\\\-8 | 9 |\\n| 18 | Ipswich | 12 | \\\\-10 | 9 |\\n| 19 | Crystal Palace | 12 | \\\\-7 | 8 |\\n| 20 | Southampton | 12 | \\\\-15 | 4 |\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

It would be tempting at the end of [this decelerating game of semi-football](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report) to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\\n\\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\\n\\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim applauds the travelling support with his players at Portman Road.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad0f0c7066cebe7ebc1cd60e5bbcb99b6a88433/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2100854616a302979aa1425592f34bfc) Ruben Amorim says Manchester United will ‘suffer’ after fast start fizzles out Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out)\\n\\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\\n\\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\\n\\nQuick Guide\\n\\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\\n\\nShow\\n\\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\\n\\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\\n\\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\\n\\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\\n\\n![Image 8: 'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec06c479b841a74129e684ca3998dbf4768effa/0_0_1843_1037/1843.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\n\\n2:11\\n\\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\\n\\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI . OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions#EmailSignup-skip-link-13)after newsletter promotion\\n\\n[![Image 9: Ruben Amorim watches his first game from the touchline.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ffa204443a161984538ddaf05fa37760035627c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7fa0df662a7130025ff043a885b75d40) Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report)\\n\\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\\n\\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\\n\\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\\n\\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\\n\\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\\n\\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\\n\\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Didn't actually realise he was being interviewed at the time. Was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie. Great game, congrats on all involved.\"\n\nSheeran became Ipswich's main shirt sponsor in 2021.\n\nAfter Ipswich earned back-to-back promotions to secure a return to the Premier League this season, he bought a minority stake in the club this summer.\n\nMarcus Rashford opened the scoring for United in the second minute, but Omari Hutchinson's 43rd-minute equaliser earned Ipswich a point.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Andre Onana! Andre Onana!\" came from the Manchester United away end in the first half against Ipswich Town and it was the first time the chant had been audible.\n\nUnited fans often cursed Onana's name when they left games during his first few months in Manchester but they are now singing it. The goalkeeper has enjoyed an impressive turnaround in fortunes and has demonstrated grit, determination and quality to get where he currently is.\n\nOnana made five saves against Ipswich, with three of those coming inside the box, and the save to deny Liam Delap in the first half was the pick of the bunch. Onana did remarkably well to make himself big and close the angle, which saw Delap's point-blank-range shot hit his bicep.\n\nIt was after that save that Onana's name was sung. The 28-year-old has come a long way since struggling when he first signed from Inter Milan and deserved the fans' recognition.\n\nThe turning point for Onana came during last winter. He ended last season strongly and hasn't looked back, continuing to improve in this season to become the team's best player on form.\n\nOnana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his outstanding double stop against Crystal Palace in September and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October.\n\nThe Cameroon international denied Youssef En-Nesyri twice in a matter of seconds as Fenerbahce threatened an equaliser in the Europa League. He got down to his left before springing back to his feet to make another save and Jose Mourinho described the saves as \"incredible\".\n\nOnana has been lavished with superlatives and nobody would have predicted that he would become United's best player in this campaign but that's exactly what has happened.\n\nAdmittedly, the bar isn't very high after a dismal start and the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but Onana has been the most consistent performer in the dressing room and keeps making important saves, so he deserves his flowers and it was great to heard his name chanted at Portman Road.\n\nIt's easy to forget that a broadcaster compiled a two-minute plus video of Onana's blunders in the Champions League in his first season, which included the ball trickling through his hands after a shot from Leroy Sane, Onana giving the ball away and conceding a penalty against Galatasaray at Old Trafford and the embarrassing moment when he let Hakim Ziyech's free-kick into the net.\n\nOnana and Amad were the best players against Ipswich.\n\nOnana was a liability in that Champions League group stage and wasn't much better in the league, but he's gone from costing the team points to regularly saving them points.\n\nHe can be proud of his performances this season, although it's never a good sign when your goalkeeper is your best player and United must reduce how frequently he's called into action.\n\nUnited will improve following Ruben Amorim's appointment. Until then, Onana should continue to deliver each week and will grow in confidence because his popularity is soaring.\n\nSomeone who worked with Onana in training last season said he is \"so powerful and athletic\" and praised his \"aggressive movements\" in between the posts. United thought they were signing a world-class 'keeper in the summer of 2023 and Onana is slowly becoming that player.\n\nOnana must sustain his excellent performances over a longer period of time but he's one of the most in-form goalkeepers in the league and has eliminated mistakes from his game.\n\nDiogo Dalot was asked about Onana in the mixed zone and said: \"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season. I think he's been really good.\"\n\nOnana is helping his teammates and United will move up the table when they return the favour.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

United are continuing to be linked with a move for Sporting Lisbon star Geovany Quenda.\nAccording to Portuguese news outlet [A Bola](http://abola.pt/), the Reds have intensified their interest in signing the 17-year-old forward ahead of the transfer window. The report claims that United already made an initial approach over the future of Quenda in October, before appointing Amorim as head coach.\nIt has been reported that United are ready to make an offer worth €60million (£50million) to sign the teenager. Quenda has a €100million (£83.5million) release clause in his contract that he extended earlier this year which runs until 2027.\nThe Manchester Evening News reported last week that Sporting are expecting United to make a move to sign Quenda in the near future. Elsewhere, United are reportedly interested in signing Quenda's Sporting teammate, Ousmane Diomande.\nAccording to [Caught Offside](https://www.caughtoffside.com/2024/11/25/ruben-amorim-ousmane-diomande-transfer/), Amorim is determined to reunite with the defender at Old Trafford. The article claims that United will face competition from [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc), [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) and Arsenal for the signing of Diomande.\nIt has been claimed that Diomande has a €80million (£66.8million) release clause in his contract, which United would be reluctant to pay.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

At least three players should be all but certain to go.\n\nBy Samuel LuckhurstChief Manchester United writer\n\nMoney is so tight at Manchester United when Erik ten Hag wanted to revert to overnight stays at a nearby hotel before home games last season, he was informed the money was not there.\n\nUnited restored a players' lounge at Old Trafford at the start of last season at Ten Hag's request. That no imagery of the pre-match hub has ever been published tells its own story.\n\nTen Hag ended United's seasonal stays at The Lowry Hotel in 2022 but he felt he could exert greater control and foster better team-bonding back at the city centre hotel, with the Hyatt Regency a possible alternative. Ten Hag was overruled.\n\nSo the prospect of United spending in the January transfer window is currently remote. They have a 28-man squad and are doubled up in every position. Triple in some. United have six senior centre backs on their books and Leny Yoro has still not had a competitive kick.\n\nIf Ruben Amorim is to have any backing in the mid-season market, United have to sell to buy. Or loan. No club worth their salt is going to part with cash for Antony (one start all season - against League One Barnsley) or Joshua Zirkzee (one goal in 18 games). United could not even obtain a decent fee from a Saudi Pro League club when Al Nassr took Alex Telles off their hands.\n\nSenior figures at United privately feel Zirkzee is a lost cause. United will need a proven goalscorer next year and someone has to make way.\n\nAmorim actually had to tell Zirkzee, purportedly a striker, to get into the box in the 93rd minute. \"At the end of the game we are around the box with two strikers, Josh has to understand that he has to go into the box for the crosses,\" Amorim bluntly said.\n\nIt was easy to surmise Amorim would not be content with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund as his striker options. Then he benched the £108.5million duo at Ipswich.\n\nUnited are the punchline again. Norway and Sweden produce brilliant forwards in Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. Which one do United sign? The Danish one. For £72m.\n\nGyokeres will be available for less than that next year. Haaland's fee was a knockdown £52m. Isak cost Newcastle £63m in 2022 - the fee Gyokeres is likely to go for in 2025.\n\nIt is easier for United to clear the decks elsewhere. Their central defensive department could be halved come July 1. Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be out of contract and so will Harry Maguire unless United trigger the one-year options in his deal.\n\nUnited only triggered the one-year option in Lindelof's contract in December with the intention of selling him. Only Lindelof continued to be injury-prone and became unsellable, so United were saddled with him. The Swede is injured again.\n\nChristian Eriksen's hitherto respectable campaign (primarily in cup games) is not cause to retain him beyond his June 30 expiry date. So Lindelof, Eriksen and Jonny Evans (who turns 37 in January) should be three certainties to go in the summer. That is the best part of £400,000 off the wage bill.\n\nThen United have to target some bigger hitters. Casemiro could be more sellable, Antony has the makings of a season-long loan with an option or obligation to buy and Zirkzee is a dud. Hojlund, as a substitute or rotational striker to support a prolific marksman, would have merit.\n\nIf United want to restore a best-in-class culture then they'll have to be ruthless. Mason Mount emerged for a nothing cameo at Ipswich, did nothing yet posted three pictures of himself onto his Instagram Stories. What kind of a mentality is that?\n\nMarcus Rashford seemed to think a goal after 80 seconds accounted for 90 minutes of work. Rashford is a stop-gap striker for Amorim, who requires an upgrade. But money is tight.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

In the time between the sacking of Ten Hag and the arrival of Amorim, Garnacho started three of the four games during Ruud van Nistelrooy's time as interim manager.\n\nDespite putting up such impressive numbers during his two-and-a-half years in the United first-team, Garnacho has taken a fair bit of flack this season for some of his recent performances, especially during the back end of Ten Hag's time at the club.\n\nHowever, Aguero believes his compatriot is unfairly criticised at times and, in fact, many of his detractors forget just how old Garnacho actually is.\n\nSpeaking to Stake.com, five-time Manchester City Premier League winner Aguero said: \"Sometimes, people forget how young Alejandro is. His raw talent got him to the Premier League at a young age, and he's proven his worth already. \n\n\"I've seen many of his teammates leaning in to help him develop as a pro player, and that's massive. If he has that type of mentorship, I'm sure there's a bright future ahead of him.\"\n\nGarnacho played 86 minutes at Portman Road on Sunday afternoon as he was used in an attacking midfield role by Amorim.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

Ipswich have now taken points off Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham, and United this season.\n\nThe brilliant first goal of the Amorim era after 81 seconds was both a sensational start and a high point. United finished the game strongly, but in between, they were pegged back for large periods and needed Andre Onana at his brilliant best to keep hold of a point.\n\nAmorim cut a frustrated figure on the touchline, but he was also proactive in trying to tilt the game back United's way. There was a double substitution after 56 minutes and another 12 minutes later when Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced together.\n\nThat change saw Hojlund replace Marcus Rashford as the focal point of the attack, while Zirkzee took the position Fernandes had been playing as the right-sided No. 10. Fernandes dropped back to a deeper midfield role, which resulted in what was probably his best spell in the game.\n\nThis was a disappointing afternoon for Fernandes, with his revival under Ruud van Nistelrooy quickly petering out under his countryman. But collecting the ball in that deeper role, closer to Manuel Ugarte, he did display an excellent range of passing and helped United sustain attacks for longer than they had managed in the first three quarters of the game.\n\nIt might be that the state of the game helped Fernandes. Ipswich were getting tired by this point, and the captain appeared well-suited to exposing them. Whether it would work playing him deeper from the start is another question, and Amorim summed up the dilemma when speaking to Sky Sports after the game.\n\n\"He improved his game by playing near the ball, so he can give us the long pass, but you cannot put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time.\"\n\nMaybe that hints at Fernandes being an option to drop deeper later in games when United are chasing goals. Amorim isn't the first United coach to find the best way to use the 30-year-old, who is both the team's most creative player and the player most likely to turn over possession.\n\nHe was neater on the ball on Sunday, completing 92% of his passes, a season-high tally by some distance. Many of those were from that advanced position, and it was noticeable that when he dropped deeper, he looked to utilise his ability to play long passes over the top, trying to get United's forwards running against Ipswich's defenders.\n\nFernandes made his United debut in a deep midfield role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1, but has barely ventured that far back since emerging as the creative fulcrum of a side lacking goals. This display was a reminder that he can do it, and he plays as more of a No. 8 for Portugal.\n\nThe difficult task for Amorim is fitting everyone in. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen started in those positions, but Manuel Ugarte will likely make one his own and Kobbie Mainoo the other. There are options for the No. 10 positions as well. Fernandes started next to Alejandro Garnacho, but Amorim could be tempted to give Mason Mount games there when his match fitness has improved.\n\nThat makes Fernandes' versatility a key weapon. There will be games where Amorim sees him as a more helpful option deeper, or even moments in games when the switch can be made. If he can coach out that tendency to look for the long pass every time, he could become even better at controlling the game.\n\nAmorim will be looking for that. The midfield combinations, like the rest of the team, will take time to gel under the new head coach, but Fernandes has given him something to think about.",

So, the tracksuit stayed. And the coincidence did not stop there as his team went on a fine run of form, beating city rivals Liverpool and Brentford in a six-day period to ensure their Premier League status.\n\nSo maybe there is a method to coach’s rituals after all.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

At least three players should be all but certain to go.\n\nBy Samuel LuckhurstChief Manchester United writer\n\nMoney is so tight at Manchester United when Erik ten Hag wanted to revert to overnight stays at a nearby hotel before home games last season, he was informed the money was not there.\n\nUnited restored a players' lounge at Old Trafford at the start of last season at Ten Hag's request.

Almost like he got caught doing something he shouldn't have, haha.”\n\nA second added: “What a mess so far by LFC. Poor summer window signing a crocked winger and a keeper when we have two of the best.\n\n“Failure to get a midfielder and now on the cusp of losing club legends. No contract will outweigh the cost of replacement and the drop in output. Get it done!”\n\nWith a third saying: “If Mo, Virgil and Trent leave, it’ll be extremely embarrassing and disastrous to FSG. Everything at Liverpool is going through these players. Can’t afford to lose even one of them.”\n\nWhile a fourth exclaimed: “I think Virg knows something might be coming up. No way our captain isn't in on it.”\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

I'm probably more out than in.\n\n\"You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said, it is December and I haven't received anything yet about my future.\n\n\"I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands.\"\n\nThe Egyptian winger was then asked by reporters if he was disappointed about the current situation, he confessed: \"Of course, yeah. I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.\n\n\"I'm disappointed but we will see.\n\n\"I am very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic. I'm just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible.\"\n\nHaving played such a pivotal role in Liverpool's success in recent years, many fans believe Salah has earned the right to extend his stay with the club, extending his current deal which sees him earn £350,000 per week.\n\nReacting to the 32-year-old's shocking revelation on social media, one fan wrote: \"Is this club actually serious?? Practically December and not an offer to our best player. Sort it out.\"\n\nWhile one suggested: \"Start protesting lads. Get the banners out this is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nAnd one noted: \"This is insane. Mo Salah’s worth to Liverpool — on and off the pitch — can’t be underestimated.\n\n\"As well as being the best player in the Premier League he’s a cultural icon across the Arab world and beyond.\"\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

He was right in front of me and he was really, really frustrated with a lot of things.\n\n\"I think initially, Dalot's positioning, I think he was a little bit frustrated with that in the first half.\n\nRuben Amorim watches on from the sideline during Man Utd's 1-1 draw with Ipswich.\n\n\"I think the midfield balance he didn't really like, and when Zirkzee came on I don't think he was overly happy with his positioning, and Hojlund as well. So there's a lot of stuff that needs a little bit of work.\n\n\"Before the game, we saw all those smiles and all that charm from Ruben Amorim. But during the game, he was really frustrated. I think he realised this is going to be a lot harder than he envisioned.\"\n\nUnited are next in action on Thursday when they take on Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the group stage of the Europa League.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Andre Onana! Andre Onana!\" came from the Manchester United away end in the first half against Ipswich Town and it was the first time the chant had been audible.\n\nUnited fans often cursed Onana's name when they left games during his first few months in Manchester but they are now singing it. The goalkeeper has enjoyed an impressive turnaround in fortunes and has demonstrated grit, determination and quality to get where he currently is.\n\nOnana made five saves against Ipswich, with three of those coming inside the box, and the save to deny Liam Delap in the first half was the pick of the bunch. Onana did remarkably well to make himself big and close the angle, which saw Delap's point-blank-range shot hit his bicep.\n\nIt was after that save that Onana's name was sung. The 28-year-old has come a long way since struggling when he first signed from Inter Milan and deserved the fans' recognition.\n\nThe turning point for Onana came during last winter. He ended last season strongly and hasn't looked back, continuing to improve in this season to become the team's best player on form.\n\nOnana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his outstanding double stop against Crystal Palace in September and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October.\n\nThe Cameroon international denied Youssef En-Nesyri twice in a matter of seconds as Fenerbahce threatened an equaliser in the Europa League. He got down to his left before springing back to his feet to make another save and Jose Mourinho described the saves as \"incredible\".\n\nOnana has been lavished with superlatives and nobody would have predicted that he would become United's best player in this campaign but that's exactly what has happened.\n\nAdmittedly, the bar isn't very high after a dismal start and the sacking of Erik ten Hag, but Onana has been the most consistent performer in the dressing room and keeps making important saves, so he deserves his flowers and it was great to heard his name chanted at Portman Road.\n\nIt's easy to forget that a broadcaster compiled a two-minute plus video of Onana's blunders in the Champions League in his first season, which included the ball trickling through his hands after a shot from Leroy Sane, Onana giving the ball away and conceding a penalty against Galatasaray at Old Trafford and the embarrassing moment when he let Hakim Ziyech's free-kick into the net.\n\nOnana and Amad were the best players against Ipswich.\n\nOnana was a liability in that Champions League group stage and wasn't much better in the league, but he's gone from costing the team points to regularly saving them points.\n\nHe can be proud of his performances this season, although it's never a good sign when your goalkeeper is your best player and United must reduce how frequently he's called into action.\n\nUnited will improve following Ruben Amorim's appointment. Until then, Onana should continue to deliver each week and will grow in confidence because his popularity is soaring.\n\nSomeone who worked with Onana in training last season said he is \"so powerful and athletic\" and praised his \"aggressive movements\" in between the posts. United thought they were signing a world-class 'keeper in the summer of 2023 and Onana is slowly becoming that player.\n\nOnana must sustain his excellent performances over a longer period of time but he's one of the most in-form goalkeepers in the league and has eliminated mistakes from his game.\n\nDiogo Dalot was asked about Onana in the mixed zone and said: \"That's why we signed him, to make saves like this and to help us the way he is this season.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It's gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham. If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, against Villa on Saturday. His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal, and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\n2:11\n\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas. It didn’t last. Ipswich pressed back with real purpose, a process that is always easier when you find no resistance, a gap, a space to press into.\n\nUnited’s midfield structure was odd, porous, leaving pathways that Ipswich began to trace, moving in neat triangles between the static parts. The equaliser was always coming, and it was fitting Omari Hutchison should score it after a sublime, high-craft first half.\n\nEither side André Onana produced not one but two astonishing point-blank saves from Liam Delap. Delap is a wonderful spectacle in the flesh, a huge, thick barrelling figure, charging about as though he’s barely in control of his own gravity, a man always chasing a round of cheese down a Gloucestershire hillside. He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead, he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing. Amorim may have a kind of Left Bank soulfulness about him, soft deep brown eyes, the perfectly cropped bristles. But he is also clear-eyed and ruthless. And yes, he really is going to need all of that.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable.

It would be tempting at the end of this decelerating game of semi-football to talk about Ruben Amorim at least _realising the scale of the job_ he faces.\n\nExcept, given Amorim almost certainly possesses a TV set and is interested in football, he already knows the scale of the job. And the scale is: really very big indeed.\n\nIt’s not the scale though. It’s the tone, the texture, the deathly spirit of this United team that really needs to be digested in the flesh, the sheer joyless incoherence, a Manchester United team that is all trapped energy and broken patterns, the football equivalent of a chipped gravy boat handed down unhappily through the generations.\n\nIt was there in the hilariously ambling patterns of Joshua Zirkzee, who just seems always to be floating around quite close to the spectacle, like a man listening to a podcast while strolling on the local rec, tactfully avoiding the dogwalkers.\n\nIt was there in a fascinating interlude on 24 minutes as United ferried the ball around sleepily, the backline completely failing to intersect with the midfield in front of it, no angles, no pockets to shift past the press. Watching this, Amorim looked calm, poker faced, right up to the moment you looked at his feet and he seemed to be trying to stand on tip toes, doing some kind of secretive hyper-clenched thigh workout, swallowing it down. He spread his arms wide as another pass shuttled across the face of the penalty area, possession without hunger or drive or purpose, football happening in a vacuum.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n#### Keane clashes with Ipswich fan\n\nShow\n\nRoy Keane became embroiled in an angry exchange with an Ipswich fan on Sunday. While off air for Sky Sports’ punditry team on the Portman Road pitch, Keane came in for abuse from a supporter who barracked him as ‘a better pundit than manager’. Keane, who was Ipswich manager from 2009 to 2011, stormed over to the fan in the stands and repeatedly shouted that they should ‘discuss it in the car park’.\n\nWith this in mind, for United’s fans the most heartening aspect of this deathly 1-1 draw with Ipswich is that Amorim very clearly gets this. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he shrugged, smiling just a little bit wearily in his post-match press conference at Portman Road. The job is huge, overwhelming, perhaps even insoluble. The first positive step is knowing all these things for certain. And Amorim’s players did him a favour in that respect here. He is, if nothing else, utterly free from any kind of illusions.\n\nFrom the start there was something lovely and windswept and vaguely Jane Austen about travelling through the Suffolk countryside to meet a handsome man with brooding eyes who has been charged with reviving a grand old ailing estate.\n\nThe three-week hiatus between appointment and full match-day rein-taking had given this occasion a sense of delayed intrigue, nine days of intense tactical edging about wing-backs and centre-half partnerships.\n\n2:11\n\n'We will suffer for a long period': Ruben Amorim on Manchester United debut – video\n\nThere was a slight sense of double take about Amorim’s starting XI. OK. So, we’re going new energy, freshness, unforgiving demands on press and movement and structure. We’re going – it says here - with Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut it only took 82 seconds for everything to be all right, with a goal that came entirely from the Amorim rejig. Amad Diallo at right wing-back? Yep. We can do that too. Here he took the ball close to halfway and went straight into a full, ravenous, high rev sprint. The low cross with his newly empowered right foot was perfectly measured. Marcus Rashford just had to walk the ball into the net.\n\nAmorim’s reaction was perfect, in that there was no reaction, just a swivel back towards the bench, a flicker perhaps in the eyes. Rashford seemed out of sorts in those early moments. That is, he seemed hungry, energised and furiously mobile. He sprinted after lost passes, fouled and harried.\n\nAnd for a while, as United had their best spell, there was a chance to linger on that vital quality, the Amorim touchline energy. There was an aura from the start, striding out in heavy-tog quilted coat, white trainers, skinny tailored slacks, off-the-peg Euro football royalty uniform. The package is good.\n\nJawline, hair, the controlled energy in his movements.\n\nThe United away support, which is always noisy, got to roll around and bounce and sing about the 12 Cantonas of Christmas.

He really should have decided this game.\n\nAmorim didn’t sit down through all of this. He didn’t scream and shout and point. Instead, he paced, hands bunched in his pockets, in an ever shrinking arc from left to right. Somebody needs to take a cleaver to this thing.

Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford’s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United’s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. **Taha Hashim**\n\n2\n\nDelap shows stomach for Ipswich’s fight\n---------------------------------------\n\nTowards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich’s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by André Onana, who saved twice from close range – the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm – denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham. If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, against Villa on Saturday. His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal, and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

He plays on the edge but hasn’t tripped up just yet. **TH**\n\n3\n\nSpurs should follow Kulusevski’s lead\n-------------------------------------\n\nAt 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham’s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. “I’d say it’s the best result ever in my career, it’s a big night for the whole club, for the coach \\[Ange Postecoglou\\], for the players but it’s not a turning point,” said the forward. “We have to be better in other games.” The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. “I have something that no other player has. So you can’t compare me to any other player – this is what I’m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart – I don’t get tired – I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can’t let anybody outwork me. That’s the plan. That’s how I play and how I train.” **Jamie Jackson**\n\n4\n\nHope for Saints in latest loss\n------------------------------\n\nSouthampton had only six shots against Liverpool – they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. “What was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,” Arne Slot said. “Today they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I’m sure they will win some games.” **Simon Burnton**\n\n5\n\nNwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvery week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling’s low cross to wrap up Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc Fàbregas is Arsenal’s only younger league scorer. He’d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he’s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential. **Jonathan Wilson**\n\n6\n\nTargeted Palmer needs protection\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you can’t beat him, kick him. Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Martínez took him out during Chelsea’s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer’s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Martínez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. **Jacob Steinberg**\n\n7\n\nLemina helps sweep Wolves to victory\n------------------------------------\n\nNecessity – an injury crisis within a relegation battle – bred invention for Wolves at Fulham. If Matheus Cunha’s contribution of two spectacular goals and a fine assist for João Gomes deservedly took the spotlight, then Wolves’ captain, Mario Lemina, showed leadership and adaptability in a cut-and-shut defensive trio. Rayan Aït-Nouri, better known for his attacking qualities, was another of the three, and threw in some vital interventions, almost scoring an own goal in doing so. Lemina, meanwhile, produced a throwback display to remind of sweepers of days gone by controlling the game from deep and supplying Cunha’s first, an equaliser at an important juncture, with a laser-guided diagonal to the Brazilian. Freeform improvisation? Not according to Gary O’Neil. “Straight off the training ground,” explained a manager safer after two successive wins and clearly confident in his own abilities. “Matheus would never arrive in that spot, if we haven’t practised that for the last few months.” **John Brewin**\n\n8\n\nDevenny chalks one up for patience\n----------------------------------\n\nBeyond Crystal Palace, Justin Devenny was a relative unknown until this month. The 21-year-old scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, against Villa on Saturday. His route to the Premier League has not been the usual story of constant upward trajectory; the midfielder started his career at Kilmarnock but they allowed him to leave for Airdrieonians in the Scottish Championship, where he was spotted by Palace and brought south. Often people expect to have their breakthrough as a teenager, but Devenny has shown that patience is beneficial even for an aspirational young player. He was disciplined and effective against Villa, with his goal capping off a fine week in which he made his Northern Ireland debut. “He was with us in the pre-season in the USA, and he showed he’s an unbelievable footballer, very technical, he can also run a lot,” said the Palace manager, Oliver Glasner. “He can play in four positions, he understands the game, he finds the space, and he also can score goals, and this is what he showed – we were very confident in him.” **Will Unwin**\n\n9\n\nWelbeck plays provider and leader\n---------------------------------\n\nAfter six goals in his first nine league games, Danny Welbeck has quietened down in recent weeks, with João Pedro returning from injury to resume his position as Brighton’s main attacking force. Welbeck’s influence remains, his hold-up play outside the area teeing up two goals against Bournemouth, the captain’s armband on as he leads in the absence of the injured Lewis Dunk. Under Fabian Hürzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s. Now the central theme is his role as a been-there-done-that battler for Brighton, a key man in their establishment as Premier League mainstays. **TH**\n\n10\n\nBlunt Everton need attacking urgency\n------------------------------------\n\nAfter a third match without a goal, and this time having played for 53 minutes against 10 men, Sean Dyche was asked whether he needed to work more on Everton’s attacking game. The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team’s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. “We’ve been working endlessly since I’ve been here to attack better,” Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. “We have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can’t make them better, make them as a unit win.” The problem for Dyche – aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners – is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning. And Everton never looked like winning against Thomas Frank’s 10 men.",

The 3-4-3 formation was present, unlike the profile of player that made his tactics so effective in Portugal.\\n    \\n    Amorim's high-octane demands are not built for a 36-year-old operating as a left-sided centre-back and two midfielders aged 32 powering the engine room.\\n    \\n    United lacked legs in defence and midfield - already a known issue - and efficient decision-making in attack - also no surprise.\\n    \\n    Amorim cannot be judged this early on.\\n    \\n    I loved his post-match quote about staying true to his plan, regardless of the squad at his disposal, rather than adapting his methods in search of short-term results.\\n    \\n    Ten Hag opted for the latter, ultimately prompting the arrival of the sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson after a predictable plight.\\n    \\n    This time around, the focus should be on short-term pain for long-term gain.\\n    \\n    _Find more from Alex Turk at_ [_Stretford Paddock_, external](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w8GnTF2Sp3wldDMtCCtVw)\\n    \\n    ![Image 33: An image detailing how to follow your Premier League team on BBC Sport: \\\"On the app?

It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n11.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

United chief executive Omar Berrada is a big fan. Going after him also made sense.\\n    \\n    The problem is having made the calls, United are now in a position where the new coach is trying to implement a new playing style, knowing there are too many midweek matches looming to allow proper training on shape and positioning, which may lead to unexpected defeats.\\n    \\n    As a club, they cannot afford to just toss away seasons as part of a big rebuild.

After playing as a right-back, a left-back and as an attacking-midfielder under former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager Erik ten Hag, his successor, Ruben Amorim, deployed him as a right-sided centre-back for his first game in charge against Ipswich Town on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\n**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim might have already found his most important player for his United plan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-might-already-found-30452668)**\\n\\nSetting up with the 3-4-3 formation that had been religiously analysed ever since succeeding Ten Hag on November 1, the former Sporting Lisbon boss tasked [Mazraoui](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/noussair-mazraoui) with operating on the right side of the back-three. He was joined in the defence by [Matthijs de Ligt](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/matthijs-de-ligt) and Jonny Evans.\\n\\nOf that rearguard, only De Ligt will be considered as a staple in United's first-choice backline once everyone is fit and available. The general expectation is that once Amorim has overseen a reduction in the size of the current injury list, De Ligt will be joined in defence by fellow summer signing [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) and Lisandro Martinez.\\n\\nYoro was not included in the matchday squad at Portman Road, with United continuing to monitor his recovery from a fractured metatarsal carefully, and Martinez missed out due to a back injury. With Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof also missing, Amorim had no choice but to make do with what he had available.\\n\\nHowever, as reported by the _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-takes-decision-leny-30417554)_ last week, Yoro is understood to be on the cusp of making his competitive debut for United. It is possible he could be awarded it this week, either against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday night or when Everton visit Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nYoro was United's statement signing of the summer, being signed from Lille in a deal initially worth £52.2million. He was on Real Madrid's radar but yet United convinced him to move to Old Trafford.\\n\\n  \\n\\n![Image 3: Leny Yoro smiles for the camera as he is pictured in training at Carrington.](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30456869.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2185450759.jpg)\\n\\nLeny Yoro could soon make his competitive debut for Manchester United. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images.)\\n\\nThe feeling is he will soon occupy the right-sided centre-back berth Mazraoui held against Ipswich. Once Martinez is back, he should join Yoro and De Ligt in making up United's first-choice back-three.\\n\\nHowever, Martinez's return is understood not to be imminent, opening up a window of opportunity for someone else to stake a claim for the left-sided centre-back berth. That someone could be [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw).\\n\\nA whopping 280 days after he made his last United appearance, the England international made his long-awaited comeback against Ipswich, appearing as a second half substitute. He slotted into the left-sided centre-back role after replacing Evans.\\n\\nShaw has experience of playing centrally for United, being tasked with playing as a left-sided centre-back several times by Ten Hag during the 2022/23 season. He admitted after a 1-0 win over Wolves on New Year's Eve in 2022 that he was \\\"really enjoying\\\" the responsibility.\\n\\nAfter so long out, United's primary mission has to be managing Shaw's load carefully and keeping him out of the treatment room. They cannot afford to push him too quickly.\\n\\nBut if he is deemed fit enough to start for United at any point within the next week or so, he is a credible option to start in the left-sided centre-back berth. He has the ball-playing ability to play in a central area and he is defensively sound.\\n\\nOf course, Martinez should be reinstated as United's chief left-sided centre-back once he recovers from his current injury, but Shaw is a solid option to compete with him and provide rotation.\\n\\nThe prospect of Yoro debuting in the coming days and Shaw being deemed fit enough to start will provide United with two very welcomed boosts. Yoro's addition to the squad in July was greeted with a wave of appreciation and Shaw, regardless of his injury concerns, is a fantastic player when he is fit.\\n\\nThe prospect of those two operating either side of De Ligt in a back-three would offer United something completely different to what was on show at Ipswich, and Amorim would be well within his rights to test the water with that approach.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Manchester United become first Premier League club to introduce key change at Old

The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\\n\\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\\n\\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\\n\\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\\n\\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\\n\\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\\n\\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United transfer news LIVE: Viktor Gyokeres update, New striker

The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\\n\\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\\n\\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\\n\\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United transfer news LIVE: Viktor Gyokeres update, New striker

£15m in compensation due to the sacked Erik ten Hag, or the £9m-plus required in compensation to Sporting CP to hire Ruben Amorim, still have United on course to post record revenues of between £650m and £670m, but when looking at the numbers across the board when compared to the same period in 2023, United have work to do.\\n\\nCommercial revenue fell 5.6% to £85.3m from £90.4m, broadcast revenue was down 20.4% from £39.3m to £31.3m, while matchday revenue fell by 3.3% to £26.5m due to a smaller number of games.\\n\\nAmorim is expected to be handed a smaller transfer kitty than his predecessors, and that is not surprising given data from analysts at the Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory shows that the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) side had a negative net transfer spend of €1.3bn (£1.09bn) over the last decade, the highest figures of any club in European football.\\n\\nThat spend has not yielded success, and Ratcliffe wants a different approach, while at the same time seeking capital for the stadium plans that the club has.\\n\\nA lack of regular UEFA [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) football has been impactful for United. The club has posted five consecutive loss-making seasons, and campaigns spent in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) have impacted the amount of funds that the club has been able to draw in, although it hasn’t seemed to slow the amount of money being spent in transfer fees and wages, until now at least.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nUnited’s ability to continue being financially strong and stable and have the ability to keep spending at a high level is predicated on them being part of the Champions League more often than not, although the club, like many Premier League teams, have been looking at ways of reducing reliance on broadcast revenues given some uncertainty over what the long-term prospects look like, even if the short-to-medium term ones look a little brighter given it was revealed that the 2025-2028 cycle would deliver £12.25bn in combined domestic, overseas and commercial revenues for Premier League clubs.\\n\\nThat, allied with the plans for the Premier League to create an in-house production company that will produce the competition’s exclusive content, much like the NFL has with the NFL Network, will, in time, likely deliver greater profit margins and financially benefit the member clubs, the 20 shareholders of the Premier League.\\n\\nBut while United head into another period of transition under another new manager, those now overseeing the operation have realised that to continue spending at high levels is no guarantee of success, and that returning the club to the very top table of European football’s elite year in, year out, will require some patience, but also some relative austerity when compared to previous years.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United

He failed to inspire United to victory in the Portuguese's first game in charge as they were forced to settle for a draw against Ipswich Town.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nThe report from Italy, via [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/contact-now-made-as-big-manchester-united-january-exit-makes-front-page/), has suggested that comments from Amorim in light of the stalemate have captured the attention of the press in the region. It has been claimed that Motta is tracking Zirkzee's progress with 'great interest'.\\n\\nCorriere dello Sport has reported that Juventus will be at the forefront of interest surrounding the forward with the future surrounding Dusan Vlahovic unclear with the 24-year-old heading into the final 18 months of his contract.\\n\\nAmorim's reflections from his first game in the dugout were particularly scathing as he highlighted his concerns. He said: \\\"I think that \\\\[decision-making\\\\] is a concern, you don’t need to coach them at this level.\\n\\n\\\"You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you \\\\[have to\\\\] put the ball in front. Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers.\\n\\n\\\"Josh \\\\[Zirkzee\\\\] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses. So we are doing some things that were not at the right moment, so that is something we have to address.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.\\\"\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My

It has been claimed that Juventus are at the front of the queue for the Dutchman after the 23-year-old helped fire Thiago Motta's Bologna to the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).\\n\\nZirkzee has endured a difficult start in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league), despite netting on his competitive debut. He failed to inspire United to victory in the Portuguese's first game in charge as they were forced to settle for a draw against Ipswich Town.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nThe report from Italy, via [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/contact-now-made-as-big-manchester-united-january-exit-makes-front-page/), has suggested that comments from Amorim in light of the stalemate have captured the attention of the press in the region. It has been claimed that Motta is tracking Zirkzee's progress with 'great interest'.\\n\\nCorriere dello Sport has reported that Juventus will be at the forefront of interest surrounding the forward with the future surrounding Dusan Vlahovic unclear with the 24-year-old heading into the final 18 months of his contract.\\n\\nAmorim's reflections from his first game in the dugout were particularly scathing as he highlighted his concerns. He said: \\\"I think that \\\\[decision-making\\\\] is a concern, you don’t need to coach them at this level.\\n\\n\\\"You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you \\\\[have to\\\\] put the ball in front. Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers.\\n\\n\\\"Josh \\\\[Zirkzee\\\\] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses. So we are doing some things that were not at the right moment, so that is something we have to address.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United icon Cristiano Ronaldo sends Elon Musk eight-word message after

It has been claimed that Juventus are at the front of the queue for the Dutchman after the 23-year-old helped fire Thiago Motta's Bologna to the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).\\n\\nZirkzee has endured a difficult start in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league), despite netting on his competitive debut. He failed to inspire United to victory in the Portuguese's first game in charge as they were forced to settle for a draw against Ipswich Town.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nThe report from Italy, via [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/contact-now-made-as-big-manchester-united-january-exit-makes-front-page/), has suggested that comments from Amorim in light of the stalemate have captured the attention of the press in the region. It has been claimed that Motta is tracking Zirkzee's progress with 'great interest'.\\n\\nCorriere dello Sport has reported that Juventus will be at the forefront of interest surrounding the forward with the future surrounding Dusan Vlahovic unclear with the 24-year-old heading into the final 18 months of his contract.\\n\\nAmorim's reflections from his first game in the dugout were particularly scathing as he highlighted his concerns. He said: \\\"I think that \\\\[decision-making\\\\] is a concern, you don’t need to coach them at this level.\\n\\n\\\"You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you \\\\[have to\\\\] put the ball in front. Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers.\\n\\n\\\"Josh \\\\[Zirkzee\\\\] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses. So we are doing some things that were not at the right moment, so that is something we have to address.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United icon Cristiano Ronaldo sends Elon Musk eight-word message after

It has been claimed that Juventus are at the front of the queue for the Dutchman after the 23-year-old helped fire Thiago Motta's Bologna to the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).\\n\\nZirkzee has endured a difficult start in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league), despite netting on his competitive debut. He failed to inspire United to victory in the Portuguese's first game in charge as they were forced to settle for a draw against Ipswich Town.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United confirm profit as first quarter financial results announced](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-confirm-net-profit-30454057)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada offers Old Trafford regeneration update](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-ceo-omar-berrada-30454814)**\\n\\nThe report from Italy, via [Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/contact-now-made-as-big-manchester-united-january-exit-makes-front-page/), has suggested that comments from Amorim in light of the stalemate have captured the attention of the press in the region. It has been claimed that Motta is tracking Zirkzee's progress with 'great interest'.\\n\\nCorriere dello Sport has reported that Juventus will be at the forefront of interest surrounding the forward with the future surrounding Dusan Vlahovic unclear with the 24-year-old heading into the final 18 months of his contract.\\n\\nAmorim's reflections from his first game in the dugout were particularly scathing as he highlighted his concerns. He said: \\\"I think that \\\\[decision-making\\\\] is a concern, you don’t need to coach them at this level.\\n\\n\\\"You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you \\\\[have to\\\\] put the ball in front. Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers.\\n\\n\\\"Josh \\\\[Zirkzee\\\\] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses. So we are doing some things that were not at the right moment, so that is something we have to address.\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.\\\"\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Man United icon Cristiano Ronaldo sends Elon Musk eight-word message after

As [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arrived to begin his [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) project during the international break, one of the key issues he immediately faces is how to relight the goalscoring fire in his new squad.\\n\\nHe seemed to have done so when [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) - starting centrally - netted inside two minutes against Ipswich Town, though that would prove to be their only strike in what turned out to be a 1-1 draw. Now 12 matches into the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) campaign, Man United have only scored 13 times.\\n\\nContributing to that total, £72m signing [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and £36.5m signing [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) have only found the net once each. This has prompted [intense transfer rumours around Amorim's arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109), particular concerning the striker he signed from Coventry City to Sporting CP a little over 12 months ago, Gyokeres.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United transfer news LIVE updates](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Amorim tipped to complete transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/kobbie-mainoo-gets-shock-man-30451524)**\\n\\nThe Sweden international has scored 67 goals in 69 appearances across all competitions since making the move to Portugal, so has been highlighted as a possible and very exciting answer to United's centre forward conundrum. However, the new manager has admitted he [will not look to steal from his former club](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-already-hinted-first-30367354#:~:text=%22I%20won't%20%5Bsign,know%2C%20we'll%20see.) during the January window, [nor does Gyokeres have any ambition to make a switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-breaks-silence-man-30387160) midway through the current season.\\n\\nA new report from [Sky Germany](https://sport.sky.de/transfer/news/34132/13260554/marmoush-boniface-davies-transfer-themen-bei-manchester-united) now claims Amorim and United chiefs have been talking over the addition of an attacker and the Sporting player does not feature amongst the four stated.\\n\\nThe first is Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani. Out of form in the French capital, a loan or full purchase are allegedly open in January though he is not a 'hot topic', despite some interest, at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nSecond is Eintracht Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian has 14 goals for the season already, is 'in the club's sights' and would cost in the region of £41.7m-£50.1m. [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) have also been rumoured to be interested.\\n\\nThird on Amorim's mind is apparently Bayer Leverkusen's Victor Boniface. It would 'cost a lot of money' to pry the Nigerian, who has scored 29 in 49 outings, from Xabi Alonso's team.\\n\\nThe final striker linked in this latest report is Victor Osimhen. The Serie A-winning hero publicly fell out with Napoli over an exit from the club, was unable to find a suitor willing to pay the £109m release clause at the time and he ended up on loan at Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIn Turkey so far the 25-year-old has netted eight goals, with a new £62.6m release at Napoli set to come into effect from January that would benefit United.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top

As [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arrived to begin his [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) project during the international break, one of the key issues he immediately faces is how to relight the goalscoring fire in his new squad.\\n\\nHe seemed to have done so when [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) - starting centrally - netted inside two minutes against Ipswich Town, though that would prove to be their only strike in what turned out to be a 1-1 draw. Now 12 matches into the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) campaign, Man United have only scored 13 times.\\n\\nContributing to that total, £72m signing [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and £36.5m signing [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) have only found the net once each. This has prompted [intense transfer rumours around Amorim's arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109), particular concerning the striker he signed from Coventry City to Sporting CP a little over 12 months ago, Gyokeres.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United transfer news LIVE updates](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Amorim tipped to complete transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/kobbie-mainoo-gets-shock-man-30451524)**\\n\\nThe Sweden international has scored 67 goals in 69 appearances across all competitions since making the move to Portugal, so has been highlighted as a possible and very exciting answer to United's centre forward conundrum. However, the new manager has admitted he [will not look to steal from his former club](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-already-hinted-first-30367354#:~:text=%22I%20won't%20%5Bsign,know%2C%20we'll%20see.) during the January window, [nor does Gyokeres have any ambition to make a switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-breaks-silence-man-30387160) midway through the current season.\\n\\nA new report from [Sky Germany](https://sport.sky.de/transfer/news/34132/13260554/marmoush-boniface-davies-transfer-themen-bei-manchester-united) now claims Amorim and United chiefs have been talking over the addition of an attacker and the Sporting player does not feature amongst the four stated.\\n\\nThe first is Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani. Out of form in the French capital, a loan or full purchase are allegedly open in January though he is not a 'hot topic', despite some interest, at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nSecond is Eintracht Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian has 14 goals for the season already, is 'in the club's sights' and would cost in the region of £41.7m-£50.1m. [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) have also been rumoured to be interested.\\n\\nThird on Amorim's mind is apparently Bayer Leverkusen's Victor Boniface. It would 'cost a lot of money' to pry the Nigerian, who has scored 29 in 49 outings, from Xabi Alonso's team.\\n\\nThe final striker linked in this latest report is Victor Osimhen. The Serie A-winning hero publicly fell out with Napoli over an exit from the club, was unable to find a suitor willing to pay the £109m release clause at the time and he ended up on loan at Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIn Turkey so far the 25-year-old has netted eight goals, with a new £62.6m release at Napoli set to come into effect from January that would benefit United.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruud van Nistelrooy could help Manchester United complete four transfers amid new job

As [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arrived to begin his [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) project during the international break, one of the key issues he immediately faces is how to relight the goalscoring fire in his new squad.\\n\\nHe seemed to have done so when [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford) - starting centrally - netted inside two minutes against Ipswich Town, though that would prove to be their only strike in what turned out to be a 1-1 draw. Now 12 matches into the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) campaign, Man United have only scored 13 times.\\n\\nContributing to that total, £72m signing [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and £36.5m signing [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) have only found the net once each. This has prompted [intense transfer rumours around Amorim's arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109), particular concerning the striker he signed from Coventry City to Sporting CP a little over 12 months ago, Gyokeres.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United transfer news LIVE updates](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Amorim tipped to complete transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/kobbie-mainoo-gets-shock-man-30451524)**\\n\\nThe Sweden international has scored 67 goals in 69 appearances across all competitions since making the move to Portugal, so has been highlighted as a possible and very exciting answer to United's centre forward conundrum. However, the new manager has admitted he [will not look to steal from his former club](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-already-hinted-first-30367354#:~:text=%22I%20won't%20%5Bsign,know%2C%20we'll%20see.) during the January window, [nor does Gyokeres have any ambition to make a switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-breaks-silence-man-30387160) midway through the current season.\\n\\nA new report from [Sky Germany](https://sport.sky.de/transfer/news/34132/13260554/marmoush-boniface-davies-transfer-themen-bei-manchester-united) now claims Amorim and United chiefs have been talking over the addition of an attacker and the Sporting player does not feature amongst the four stated.\\n\\nThe first is Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani. Out of form in the French capital, a loan or full purchase are allegedly open in January though he is not a 'hot topic', despite some interest, at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nSecond is Eintracht Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian has 14 goals for the season already, is 'in the club's sights' and would cost in the region of £41.7m-£50.1m. [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) have also been rumoured to be interested.\\n\\nThird on Amorim's mind is apparently Bayer Leverkusen's Victor Boniface. It would 'cost a lot of money' to pry the Nigerian, who has scored 29 in 49 outings, from Xabi Alonso's team.\\n\\nThe final striker linked in this latest report is Victor Osimhen. The Serie A-winning hero publicly fell out with Napoli over an exit from the club, was unable to find a suitor willing to pay the £109m release clause at the time and he ended up on loan at Galatasaray for this season.\\n\\nIn Turkey so far the 25-year-old has netted eight goals, with a new £62.6m release at Napoli set to come into effect from January that would benefit United.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ruud van Nistelrooy could help Manchester United complete four transfers amid new job

\\\"Comments\\\")\\n\\nContributing to that total, £72m signing [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-hojlund) and £36.5m signing [Joshua Zirkzee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/joshua-zirkzee) have only found the net once each. This has prompted [intense transfer rumours around Amorim's arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109), particular concerning the striker he signed from Coventry City to Sporting CP a little over 12 months ago, Gyokeres.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United transfer news LIVE updates](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Mainoo gets shock Man United warning as Amorim tipped to complete transfer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/kobbie-mainoo-gets-shock-man-30451524)**\\n\\nThe Sweden international has scored 67 goals in 69 appearances across all competitions since making the move to Portugal, so has been highlighted as a possible and very exciting answer to United's centre forward conundrum. However, the new manager has admitted he [will not look to steal from his former club](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-already-hinted-first-30367354#:~:text=%22I%20won't%20%5Bsign,know%2C%20we'll%20see.) during the January window, [nor does Gyokeres have any ambition to make a switch](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/viktor-gyokeres-breaks-silence-man-30387160) midway through the current season.\\n\\nA new report from [Sky Germany](https://sport.sky.de/transfer/news/34132/13260554/marmoush-boniface-davies-transfer-themen-bei-manchester-united) now claims Amorim and United chiefs have been talking over the addition of an attacker and the Sporting player does not feature amongst the four stated.\\n\\nThe first is Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani. Out of form in the French capital, a loan or full purchase are allegedly open in January though he is not a 'hot topic', despite some interest, at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).\\n\\nSecond is Eintracht Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian has 14 goals for the season already, is 'in the club's sights' and would cost in the region of £41.7m-£50.1m. [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) have also been rumoured to be interested.\\n\\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\\n\\nPowered by ![Image

It would 'cost a lot of money' to pry the Nigerian, who has scored 29 in 49 outings, from Xabi Alonso's team.\\n\\nThe final striker linked in this latest report is Victor Osimhen.

I thought he was being quite aggressive, in hindsight.\\n\\nAdvert\\n\\n\\\"The guy had an issue, when \\\\[Keane\\\\] was at the club, when you see him point he was pointing to 'when you were here in the car park, you ignored my kids and swore at them', and he had an issue with that.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\\n\\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\\n=======================================================================\\n\\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\\n\\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\\n\\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s [1-1 draw at Ipswich](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report). Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

Clearly not all teams above are going to drop more points than United do. I feel we should stop focusing on fourth place and focus on improvement for next season. Where we finish is where we finish.\\n    \\n    I don't know if it is instant gratification or a lack of knowledge among many fans, but (tell me if I am wrong) a new coach does not simply say: 'Now we set up like this, you play this position and problem solved'. It takes a lot of time and practice to replace old ways and habits with new ones.\\n    \\n    I say we need to be patient and judge it in the new season. What is your take on whether Manchester United are likely to improve?\\n    \\n    **Phil answered:** These are all very good points and Ruben Amorim made a lot of them himself after the draw at Ipswich Town, when he pointed out that Manchester United will have to \\\"suffer\\\" while he implements his tactical tweaks, saying it was worth risking things tactically now to feel the benefit next season.\\n    \\n    So yes, patience will be needed and, in my experience, Manchester United fans are remarkably patient with their managers.\\n    \\n    What we have seen from Amorim already is a clear identity in terms of how he wants to play and a clear idea of his strategy. I don't think we ever really saw that from Erik ten Hag.\\n    \\n    I think United will improve – and I wouldn't write off fourth place either, because I really believe that slot is wide open – but it will take time and patience, and there will be bumps along the way.\\n    \\n6.

We were better than Manchester United. This line-up is definitely our strongest 11 (apart from the absent Greaves). If we continue to play like this we will stay up. Omari was outstanding.\\n    \\n    **James**: This was another step in the right direction for Town, with a fully deserved point. It was frustrating to concede so early, as we were the team in the ascendancy in the first half, which was capped by a superb goal by Omari Hutchinson. There wasn't much between the two sides in the second half and we again showed our resilience to see out the draw.\\n    \\n    **Michael**: Wonderful performance by Town after what some would say is our regular early mistake. We battled well and had we won the game it would not have been an injustice. Credit should also go to the referee, Anthony Taylor, who allowed the game to flow and kept control throughout.\\n    \\n    **Phillip**: We more than matched a top team in the Premier League/ Europe. We probably should have got all three points. We have to believe in this fantastic team of ours because we were brilliant, as we were at T[ottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur). We are building something special. Kieran McKenna, what can I say, amazing achievement. Absolutely buzzing.\\n    \\n    **United fans**\\n    \\n    **Mike58**: Obviously disappointed not to win but a draw was the least Ipswich deserved. Signs of life to come - a manager/coach with tactical knowledge and an identity. He will improve these players, for sure. Having had only days to work with these players he has overachieved. Onana clear player of the match for United.\\n    \\n    **Mark**: Early days but the same old problems resurfaced and we need to stop giving the ball away cheaply. We bossed the second half and deserved the win, but the cutting edge is still missing up front and we should be more clinical. Hopefully Amorin will iron these problems out and we will improve - slowly but steadily.\\n    \\n    **Toni**: Wasn't expecting miracles, to be honest. Amorim has a lot of work to do. However, some players can be moved on in January. We cannot and must not have a squad of uninterested professionals. A draw was good enough but we need more effort.\\n    \\n    **Davos**: A steady start for Amorim. He has plenty of work to do to get the boys firing on all cylinders. The midfield seemed a little slow at times and we just need a striker to be in the box for when the ball is played into that area as both Zirkzee and Hojlund look lost.

On Sunday, Leicester announced Cooper's departure from the King Power Stadium after securing only two victories in his 12-game tenure, with the club choosing to move forward following Saturday's loss to [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc).\\n\\nThe incoming manager will take over a team currently positioned 16th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) and without a win in four games. Van Nistelrooy, who recently enjoyed two triumphs over the Foxes during his temporary stint at the helm of United, is now tipped to replace Cooper.\\n\\n[The Coventry City position, which remains vacant following the dismissal of Mark Robins, was one that Van Nistelrooy was reportedly considered for.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-next-job-30433486) Former Chelsea and Everton boss Frank Lampard was also in the frame for that role and now appears to be the frontrunner to take charge at the CBS Arena.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Manchester United player ratings as Andre Onana good but three get 4/10 vs Ipswich Town](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-andre-30440825)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Roy Keane asks Ruben Amorim to change one thing after 45 minutes as Man United manager](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-asks-ruben-amorim-30441479)**\\n\\nIt's since been suggested that United legend Van Nistelrooy has been waiting for a chance to manage a top-flight team, with several managers, including those at Crystal Palace, Wolves and Southampton, under severe pressure.\\n\\nTherefore, it's likely that Van Nistelrooy will stay in England and aim to return to a full managerial role, making him a possible contender should City consider replacing Cooper with the Dutchman. Van Nistelrooy could reunite with United in March, with Leicester hosting the Reds on the 15th of that month.\\n\\nHowever, a return to former club Hamburger SV could also be on the table. According to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is on the list of possible replacements for Steffen Baumgart at the Bundesliga 2 club and has already been discussed internally. Following his departure from [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), Ruben Amorim has been appointed the club's new head coach.\\n\\nHis first game in charge arrived this past Sunday with a 1-1 Premier League draw played out against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Ex-Man United manager Jose Mourinho ordered to leave Turkish football as huge row erupts](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jose-mourinho-fenerbahce-man-united-30361879?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Roy Keane asks Ruben Amorim to change one thing after 45 minutes as Man United manager](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-keane-asks-ruben-amorim-30441479?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-united-30441773#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy)\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Leicester City FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30361876.ece/alternates/s338a/1_Trabzonspor-v-Fenerbahce-Turkish-Super-Lig.jpg)\\n\\nEx-Man United manager Jose Mourinho ordered to leave Turkish football as huge row erupts\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[Andre Onana](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/andre-onana)[Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)[Man United goalkeeper Andre Onana was typically honest following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Manchester United's new era under Ruben Amorim began with a draw at Ipswich Town but his squad could be about to get a boost](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n\\n[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\\n\\n[First Premier League weekend on Bluesky was nice and soft but X hard-edges remain John Brewin Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/first-premier-league-weekend-on-bluesky-was-nice-and-soft-but-x-hard-edges-remain)\\n\\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to [“suffer for a long period”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-will-suffer-after-fast-start-fizzles-out) before their fortunes turn.\\n\\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\\n\\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\\n\\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\\n\\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\\n\\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\\n\\n[skip past newsletter promotion](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/ruben-amorim-diogo-dalot-high-demands-manchester-united#EmailSignup-skip-link-9)after newsletter promotion\\n\\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\\n\\n“The message he \\\\[Amorim\\\\] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me \\\\[as the left wing-back\\\\] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\\n\\n**Subscribe to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly newsletter from one of the world’s top soccer journalists.**\\n\\nI’m lucky enough to have been able to turn a childhood soccer obsession into a 24-year career that has included 13 books, regular columns in the best publications in the world and regular namechecks on Ted Lasso.\\n\\nNow, I’m writing a weekly newsletter about European football aimed at a US audience, and I hope you consider signing up for it.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were back.\\n\\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for [Kieran McKenna's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kieran-mckenna) team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ed Sheeran breaks silence on Ruben Amorim exchange after Man United backlash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ed-sheeran-breaks-silence-ruben-30446892)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United news LIVE: £50m transfer talk 'intensifies' as Van Nistelrooy update emerges](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\nThose improvements never came and [it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-ipswich-score-30419615). But that may not be a bad thing.\\n\\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\\n\\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\\n\\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\\n\\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit [such as Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842), or just coming back from long layoffs like [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw). And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\\n\\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine. No manager can fix that after just a few days. Amorim will hope that expectation levels have dropped and he can now focus on the long road to getting United back to the top again.\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30450513#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford)\\n*   [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw)\\n*   [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro)\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were back.\\n\\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for [Kieran McKenna's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kieran-mckenna) team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ed Sheeran breaks silence on Ruben Amorim exchange after Man United backlash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ed-sheeran-breaks-silence-ruben-30446892)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United news LIVE: £50m transfer talk 'intensifies' as Van Nistelrooy update emerges](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\nThose improvements never came and [it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-ipswich-score-30419615). But that may not be a bad thing.\\n\\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\\n\\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\\n\\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\\n\\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit [such as Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842), or just coming back from long layoffs like [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw). And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\\n\\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were back.\\n\\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for [Kieran McKenna's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kieran-mckenna) team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ed Sheeran breaks silence on Ruben Amorim exchange after Man United backlash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ed-sheeran-breaks-silence-ruben-30446892)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United news LIVE: £50m transfer talk 'intensifies' as Van Nistelrooy update emerges](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\nThose improvements never came and [it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-ipswich-score-30419615). But that may not be a bad thing.\\n\\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\\n\\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\\n\\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\\n\\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit [such as Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842), or just coming back from long layoffs like [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw). And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\\n\\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine. No manager can fix that after just a few days. Amorim will hope that expectation levels have dropped and he can now focus on the long road to getting United back to the top again.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30450513#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford)\\n*   [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw)\\n*   [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) were back.\\n\\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for [Kieran McKenna's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/kieran-mckenna) team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Ed Sheeran breaks silence on Ruben Amorim exchange after Man United backlash](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ed-sheeran-breaks-silence-ruben-30446892)**\\n\\n**READ MORE: [Man United news LIVE: £50m transfer talk 'intensifies' as Van Nistelrooy update emerges](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-live-30442382)**\\n\\nThose improvements never came and [it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-ipswich-score-30419615). But that may not be a bad thing.\\n\\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\\n\\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\\n\\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\\n\\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit [such as Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842), or just coming back from long layoffs like [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw). And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\\n\\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine. No manager can fix that after just a few days. Amorim will hope that expectation levels have dropped and he can now focus on the long road to getting United back to the top again.\\n\\n**READ NEXT:**\\n\\n*   [Andre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/andre-onana-gives-honest-assessment-30441802?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim could soon add another player to strongest Man United squad without spending a penny](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ruben-amorim-could-soon-add-30449842?int_source=nba)\\n*   [My mum got everyone in my family the same £22 gift and won Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/real-life/mum-everyone-family-same-22-30446054?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Boots reduces £66 designer perfume to £19 that 'gets compliments when you're out'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/fashion-news/boots-reduces-66-designer-perfume-30398648?int_source=nba)\\n*   [Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109?int_source=nba)\\n\\nStory Saved\\n\\nYou can find this story in  [My Bookmarks.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/my-bookmarks)Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\\n\\nFollow Manchester Evening News\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManchesterEveningNews)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MENSports)\\n\\n[Comment](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-first-man-united-30450513#comments-wrapper)\\n\\nMore On\\n\\n*   [Manchester United FC](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)\\n*   [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)\\n*   [Marcus Rashford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/marcus-rashford)\\n*   [Luke Shaw](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/luke-shaw)\\n*   [Leny Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro)\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\n![Image 3](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article30441800.ece/alternates/s338a/0_IMG_6641.jpg)\\n\\nAndre Onana gives honest assessment of Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United\\n\\n*   Sport\\n*   all\\n\\n*   Most Read\\n*   Most Recent\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/marwood/TM/img/placeholders/transparent.png)](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)\\n\\n[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)[Manchester United can start their Ruben Amorim rebuild by releasing three players](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-can-start-ruben-30445109)[Conclusions can be made on a host of necessary outgoings at Man United next year.

When Marcus Rashford scored within the first two minutes of Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era beginning, it had many fans wondering just what might be possible.\n    \n    But they were brought back down to earth by Ipswich winger Omari Hutchinson's strike before half-time.\n    \n    And in the latest episode of BBC Radio Manchester's The Devils' Advocate podcast, the team have been deciding what to make of the new boss' first game in charge.\n    \n2.  New Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is keen on Wolves' 23-year-old Algeria wing-back Rayan Ait-Nouri.\n    \n    United are monitoring Wolves' 25-year-old Brazil forward Matheus Cunha, with Tottenham also showing interest.\n    \n    The Red Devils are also interested in Chelsea's Christopher Nkunku but could face competition from Borussia Dortmund for the 27-year-old France forward.\n    \n    Manchester United have enquired about Sporting's 17-year-old Portugal U21s winger Geovany Quenda, who is valued at 60m euros (£50.1m).\n    \n    The Red Devils are targeting a number of strikers, with PSG's 25-year-old France international Randal Kolo Muani and Eintracht Frankfurt's Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, 25, on the club's radar.\n    \n3.  Ruben Amorim's first game in charge of Manchester United ended in a 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town and the latest episode of BBC Radio Manchester's The Devils' Advocate has landed to unpick it all.\n    \n4.  Manchester United's new formation may have to \"evolve into something else\" if they are going to be competitive in the Premier League, says former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy.\n    \n    New boss Ruben Amorim used his favoured formation of three at the back in his first game in charge against Ipswich on Sunday.\n    \n5.  Ruben Amorim became only the second permanent manager in Premier League history to see his side score within the opening two minutes of his very first game in charge, alongside David Moyes with Everton in March 2002.\n    \n    However, this was just the second time Manchester United have scored inside the opening two minutes of a Premier League game and failed to win, drawing 2-2 with Liverpool in October 1995 and losing 1-6 to Tottenham in October 2020.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

United were back.\n\nOf course, those expectations would have dampened less than 45 minutes later when Omari Hutchinson curled in a deserved equaliser for Kieran McKenna's team just before half-time. Amorim would have gone into the dressing room knowing his side needed major improvements to get all three points.\n\nThose improvements never came and it ended up being a rather disappointing 1-1 draw against relegation strugglers. But that may not be a bad thing.\n\nIf anyone was under any illusions over how much work Amorim needs to do if United are to challenge, they got it at Portman Road. There is no quick fix at Old Trafford and the new Portuguese boss will be well aware of that.\n\nObviously, a convincing win would have been great but it may suit Amorim that excitement has slightly dampened. The fact that no one is getting carried away will allow United to focus on improving.\n\nThere have been too many false dawns over the past decade. Bright starts under previous managers have led many to believe that United are on the road back to glory.\n\nBut a reality check away at a team who sit in the relegation zone will serve notice to the fact that there's a long road back. Yes, Amorim has only had a few days to work with the majority of his squad after the international break.\n\nIt should also be noted that there are several players still not fully fit or just coming back from long layoffs like Luke Shaw. And yet, it was a result entirely in keeping with what most have come to expect when watching the Reds play.\n\nThis is a group of individuals who are far from being a well-oiled, winning machine. No manager can fix that after just a few days. Amorim will hope that expectation levels have dropped and he can now focus on the long road to getting United back to the top again.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

On Sunday, Leicester announced Cooper's departure from the King Power Stadium after securing only two victories in his 12-game tenure, with the club choosing to move forward following Saturday's loss to Chelsea.\n\nThe incoming manager will take over a team currently positioned 16th in the Premier League and without a win in four games. Van Nistelrooy, who recently enjoyed two triumphs over the Foxes during his temporary stint at the helm of United, is now tipped to replace Cooper.\n\nIt's since been suggested that United legend Van Nistelrooy has been waiting for a chance to manage a top-flight team, with several managers, including those at Crystal Palace, Wolves and Southampton, under severe pressure.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that Van Nistelrooy will stay in England and aim to return to a full managerial role, making him a possible contender should City consider replacing Cooper with the Dutchman. Van Nistelrooy could reunite with United in March, with Leicester hosting the Reds on the 15th of that month.\n\nHowever, a return to former club Hamburger SV could also be on the table. According to Sky Sports Germany, Van Nistelrooy is on the list of possible replacements for Steffen Baumgart at the Bundesliga 2 club and has already been discussed internally. Following his departure from Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim has been appointed the club's new head coach.\n\nHis first game in charge arrived this past Sunday with a 1-1 Premier League draw played out against Ipswich Town at Portman Road.\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock\n\n‘Exactly what we need’: Diogo Dalot praises Ruben Amorim’s high demands\n=======================================================================\n\n*   Clarity of coach’s messaging also impresses defender\n*   He says Amorim’s philosophy suits Manchester United\n\nDiogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what Manchester United need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach’s messaging and his highly demanding nature.\n\nAmorim’s first match was Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Ipswich. Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT"

Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002.\n\nAs it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to “suffer for a long period” before their fortunes turn.\n\nIt was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot – having sprinted up from left wing-back – were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0.\n\nDalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break.\n\n“It’s gone really well,” Dalot said. “He made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. It suits the standards of the club – high-intensity football and working hard for the team.\n\n“We have to give credit to him and his staff for all the information they gave us. It was really clear and obviously now we will take some more training sessions and games to put this into practice.\n\n“He’s really demanding. He’s exactly what we need for this type of club. That’s the standard the club should have, by demanding people are really professional and working hard for the team. That’s the clear message that he gives us every day.”\n\nAmorim’s reserves of reputational credit run deep and the United travelling support got behind him at the outset, singing his name to the tune of Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band. What frustrated Amorim was how his team surrendered the initiative after Rashford’s goal. The buildup play from the back became jammed, the fluidity missing. United would be indebted to the goalkeeper, André Onana, for three big saves.\n\n“The message he [Amorim] gave to everybody was clear – he wants us to have more control of the games,” Dalot said. “And that’s what we want to do. With me [as the left wing-back] it was: ‘Sprint back and be really hard-working. Give an option and don’t be afraid to have the ball.’ I felt comfortable. I’ve played on the left a couple of times now and the system is good for this club. I’ve played with three centre-backs before.”\n\n# END OF ARTICLE TEXT",

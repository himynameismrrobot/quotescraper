Ruud van Nistelrooy ensured he remains unbeaten as [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager over the weekend thanks to a 3-0 win over Leicester City in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

Goals from [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) and [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho) as well as an own goal saw United come out as comfortable winners at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). It means that the team picked up three wins and a draw in Van Nistelrooy's four games in charge of the club.

This week sees the start of a new era with new head coach [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arriving from Sporting Clube de Portugal. He will take training this week in preparation for the Premier League clash against Ipswich Town after the international break.

Amorim's arrival does however put doubt over where Van Nistelrooy's future lies. The former striker arrived this summer as assistant manager to Erik ten Hag.

With Amorim bringing his own staff to the club, it remains to be seen if Van Nistelrooy will stay at the club, and if so, in what capacity with a decision expected today (Monday).

Stay here for the latest updates surrounding Amorim's arrival and Van Nistelrooy's future, as well as any other Manchester United news.

### Ruben Amorim unveiling

Ruben Amorim's first press conference after arriving at Manchester United, will not be an unveiling on, with the new head coach doing his normal pre-match media duties.

That will be the first time that the new man will talk to the media, with no unveiling press conference planned, according to the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14065769/Ruben-Amorim-work-permit-manchester-united.html).

It meant that the press conference will take place just a couple of days before the Premier League meeting against Ipswich at Portman Road. That game will see United come up against former assistant manager Kieran McKenna with his team winning their first game of the season against Tottenham last time out.

### What has been said on van Nistelrooy's future?

One big question today is on the future of Ruud van Nistelrooy, here has what has been said so far:

Following the game against Leicester, van Niselrooy said:

> "I appreciated the clear communication of the club, that it was interim for the short term," Van Nistelrooy said. "It could've been one or two games even, that was the first communication, and they kept me in the loop and said okay, it's gonna be four \[games\].
> 
> "For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is this football club, and I'm here to support that in my role.
> 
> "And, as I said, I want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

Amorim has since given his own update:

> “About a legend of the club. He did a great job. I have to talk with him tomorrow. Then I will explain everything. I am very clear and I will tell you like it is. Let’s wait until tomorrow.”

He left Lisbon to fly to Manchester at 11am on Monday, landing at [Manchester Airport](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-airport) at around 1.45pm. Amorim was accompanied by the five staff members he is bringing with him to the club, Carlos Fernandes, Adélio Cândido, Paulo Barreira, Emanuel Ferro and Jorge Vital.

Amorim had been due to meet club staff at Carrington this afternoon, with the non-internationals in the first-team squad also in today, but for now it is unclear if he will head to the training ground.

The 39-year-old is also set to hold talks with Van Nistelrooy over whether he will form a part of his backroom staff, having overseen three wins and a draw from his four games in charge.

Amorim can't take training sessions yet as he waits for his visa to come through, although that is expected to arrive swiftly. The squad will be off for the rest of the week before reconvening at Carrington to prepare for Amorim's first game in charge against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday, November 24.

Next week will be the chance for Amorim to begin implementing his own playing style on the squad, with Van Nistelrooy yesterday saying there is still more to come from this squad as he was asked whether it would fit the new head coach's playing style.

"That is a very good question. What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four game period and staff to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85 percent and put in little tweaks or changing players and resting players and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back," he said.

"You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside forwards, I can’t comment on that."

Ruben Amorim has boarded a private flight bound for Manchester Airport as he prepares to take over at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). In the process, he has appeared to confirm a large portion of his backroom staff.

[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) boarded a private jet at Beja International Airport just before 11am. on Monday, and Portuguese TV crews captured his arrival. The plane is due to land in Manchester at around 1.45 p.m.

The 39-year-old was joined on the flight by Carlos Fernandes, Adélio Candido, Paulo Barreira, Emanuel Ferro, and Jorge Vital. After negotiations with Sporting for their release, all five are expected to join Amorim's backroom staff at [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc).

Fernandes, Candido and Ferro are part of Amorim's first-team coaching set-up, while Vital is his goalkeeping coach. Barreira is a sporting scientist. There was also speculation that Amorim wanted to bring fitness coach Goncalo Alvaro with him, although he wasn't spotted boarding the flight.

Fernandes is Amorim's right-hand man, and he confirmed his own exit from Sporting with an Instagram post on Sunday night after they had come from behind to beat Braga 4-2.

“So many moments that I will cherish forever,” he wrote alongside a selection of pictures from his four years at the club. “There is no other feeling other than eternal gratitude towards those who helped us create something so special: players for whom there are no words, colleagues who became friends and everyone who always supported us. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.”

The presence of three senior coaches could be bad news for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was one of Erik ten Hag's assistants and took charge of first-team affairs for four games, overseeing three wins and a draw.

Amorim and Van Nistelrooy are set to hold face-to-face talks at Carrington later today and while Amorim praised the club's former striker on Sunday night, he stopped short of confirming he would stay on and appeared to hint that an exit was most likely.

“About a legend of the club, he did a great job. I have to talk with him, then I will explain everything," he said.

Manchester United are 13th in the Premier League and talk of winning the title is fanciful, but Ruben Amorim must believe he can end the wait for league glory at Old Trafford. Each manager since Sir Alex Ferguson has failed in that remit and fans are hoping Amorim will be different.

Although the only thing on supporters' minds right now is climbing into the top half, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a vision and didn't invest millions for [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) to continue to be a mediocre side.

[Ratcliffe](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-jim-ratcliffe) wants United to be the best and [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arrives at a club that has a hierarchy to support that ambition. Erik ten Hag didn't have that luxury when he was appointed from Ajax and Amorim inheriting a more organised ship gives hope he can steer the great vessel to success again.

It's thought Omar Berrada has informed club staff that Ineos want to win the Premier League by 2028, which is coincidentally when Amorim's two-and-a-half-year contract expires.

**ALSO READ: [United player ratings as Amad shines and six get 7/10](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30338793)**

**ALSO READ:** **[Bruno Fernandes takes swipe at United fan](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruno-fernandes-takes-swipe-manchester-30337778)**

Amorim will have been in charge for two summer transfer windows by the time the 2027/28 season begins and it would be a shock if Pep Guardiola is still managing Manchester City.

Guardiola has made City practically untouchable during his tenure at the Etihad but their spell of dominance is showing clear signs of ending and the 115 alleged charges are lingering.

The door will open for when Guardiola leaves and that is inching closer. There will be an opportunity for United and the club believe they have hired a coach to capitalise on that anticipated opening. The cards may fall at the right time and tee up the perfect set of circumstances.

Amorim has already hinted at immediately using his 3-4-3 formation and the current conversation among fans is about which players fit in the system and which players will be starters.

United have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign and there are holes in the squad, but Amorim will inherit some talented players and will relish working with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo and Amad, who are all yet to reach their ceilings.

Mainoo and Garnacho finished in the top 10 placings of the Kopa Trophy, the award given to the best Under-21 player, last month and have become established players for England and Argentina respectively, which is incredible given they were playing for United's Under-18s in 2022.

  

![Image 4: Goal-scorers Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho of Manchester United after their sides 2-1 win during the Emirates FA Cup Final match between Manchester City and Manchester United](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29870756.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-2154626904.jpg)

Amorim will build around Mainoo and Garnacho. (Image: Robin Jones/Getty Images.)

The pair were responsible for the goals in the FA Cup final against City last season and are two players Amorim should build his team around. It's going to be fascinating to watch Mainoo and Garnacho develop further under Amorim and they should be mainstays in the team for years to come.

Garnacho's goal from the bench against Leicester at the weekend was wonderful and the 'fan' who was responsible for his toned-back celebration should hang their head in shame.

Amad's breakthrough into the team hasn't been as straightforward but he's suddenly got momentum behind him again and it's a scandal Erik ten Hag was overlooking him for Antony.

His performance against PAOK in the Europa League last week was outstanding and he backed that up with another bright display against Leicester. Amad's backheel for Bruno Fernandes' opening goal was a stroke of genius and he vindicated Ruud van Nistelrooy's decision to start him.

How Amorim fits Garnacho and Amad into his system - there should be no concerns with Mainoo - remains to be seen but they are clearly the team's best wingers on current form.

When the 2027/28 season begins, Amad will be 25 years old, Garnacho will be 23 and Mainoo will be 22, which shows why it's so exciting for United to have all three of them at the club.

Despite being so young, the trio are currently some of the best players in the dressing room and they should have enough quality to form part of a potentially title-winning squad.

Youth, courage and success are the founding principles of United and will continue to be.

=======================================================================================================

After serenading Ruud van Nistelrooy for what might well be the final time, the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) faithful turned their attention to the players and one of them in particular. As the squad made their way towards the tunnel, Casemiro's name once again echoed down from the [Stretford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stretford) End.

That came after he had received a thunderous ovation when he was substituted 11 minutes from the end of a resounding 3-0 victory against Leicester City, appreciation for another excellent performance from a player who has enjoyed an unexpected but very welcome renaissance.

When he was taken off at half-time against [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) on September 1, it really did look like the Brazilian's career at the highest level was over. Those obituaries for a five-time [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) winner have now been put in the shredder.

**ALSO READ: ['We cannot ignore' - Casemiro offers upbeat assessment of what Amorim can do at United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/we-cannot-ignore-casemiro-offers-30342257)**

**ALSO READ: [Amorim has two unexpected United undroppables - thanks to Van Nistelrooy decision](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-two-unexpected-man-30338961)**

He has gradually found his feet once again and has now started five successive games. He scored the final goal of the Erik ten Hag era, which might be considered somehwat ironic given their relationship had frayed by the end. As Casemiro's form plummeted last season, the one unknown was how much of that was down to a system leaving him woefully exposed.

Now we seem to have an answer. In four games under Ruud van Nistelrooy, there has been more structure, and Casemiro's partnership with Manuel Ugarte, the man signed to replace him, has flourished. They began all four of those games together.

As Ruben Amorim prepares to take over, Casemiro's spot as an invaluable member of the starting XI suddenly looks restored. With his confidence returning, the leadership skills valued in his first season after a £70m move from Real Madrid are also returning.

So too, is that spikiness. When Casemiro spoke to reporters after the win against the Foxes he was asked whether his form was improving this season, and he made it very clear what he thought.

"Well, everyone can see can’t they? I only had the [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) game, right? The whole team was not good in that game," he said..

"But individually, of course when the goals are missed, of course it ends up hurting the team more, but I think it's been a good season for me. I want to continue growing, I want to continue helping my team-mates and the coach, helping [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) grow and well, everyone knows what my job is."

That Casemiro has had the chance to re-establish himself as a key figure at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) came about more through luck than judgement. After his woes in his second season, he was available for transfer in the summer, only for a lack of interest to put paid to any exit.

With two years remaining on a contract worth in excess of £300,000-a-week, United were willing to part with the Brazilian to fund other transfer activity, especially with Ugarte earmarked to replace him. But Saudi clubs showed little interest in Casemiro, and he ended up staying, with Ugarte arriving on the final day of the window. Rather than replacing him, the two South Americans have now formed a potent partnership in United's midfield.

Van Nistelrooy showed the faith in Ugarte that Ten Hag lacked, and he quickly developed a close relationship with Casemiro. The two shared a lengthy hug on the pitch after Casemiro scored twice in the Carabao Cup win against Leicester City. That partnership with Ugarte could now be vital in Amorim's 3-4-3, and Casemiro believes their four-game stint together has seen an understanding blossom.

"I have a good connection with him. When one goes forward, the other covers, and vice versa. That is how it has to be, one compliments the other. I think the other games have been like this," he said.

"He is a great person. Then, little by little he is also showing that he is a national team player from Uruguay, from a team that has good players. Then he has total respect, not only mine, but all the players. And well, it is good for us to have good players, so we have a much better squad."

Casemiro remains a key part of the squad, a situation that didn't look likely just a couple of months ago.

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will hold talks about Ruud van Nistelrooy's future on Monday.

[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) managed his final game in charge of Sporting Lisbon on Sunday night and secured a dramatic 4-2 win against Braga on the road after being 2-0 down by half-time.

The 39-year-old was mobbed by his players at the final whistle and will arrive in Manchester on Monday, meaning he will oversee his first United match against Ipswich Town.

Sporting's players said goodbye to Amorim after their Braga victory. Amorim led Sporting to their first league title in 19 years during his first full season at the Jose Alvalade Stadium and United believe they have appointed one of the finest coaching prospects in Europe.

The excitement is building for Amorim's reign at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) but his imminent arrival could mean Van Nistelrooy, who managed four games as interim manager, leaves the club.

Although Van Nistelrooy has confirmed he would like to see out his two-year contract as United assistant manager, Amorim is bringing his own coaches to Carrington from Sporting.

After the Braga win, Amorim was asked about Van Nistelrooy at his final Sporting press conference and said: “About a legend of the club. He did a great job. I have to talk with him tomorrow. Then I will explain everything. I am very clear and I will tell you like it is. Let’s wait until tomorrow.”

He also discussed his style of play and suggested he would play his 3-4-3 formation from the start. "I know how I am going to play in the beginning because you have to start with a structure that you know," he said.

"Then you will adapt with the players that you have, some injuries, or no injuries, what kind of players have the abilities to defend, attack, I will discover that in the next few weeks.

“We don’t have a lot of time to train, so I have to show something that I know very well. You can take whatever you want from that.”

Carlos Fernandes, 29, and Adelio Candido, 28, followed Amorim from Barga to Sporting in 2020 and they have been crucial in his success at the Jose Alvalade Stadium, while Amorim has also previously said if he becomes Bobby Robson then Fernandes is 'his [Jose Mourinho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho)'.

There is currently uncertainty around Van Nistelrooy, Rene Hake and Andreas Georgson, who were all appointed in the summer as Ineos looked to freshen up Erik ten Hag's staff.

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) has suspended David Coote with immediate effect amid an investigation into a video circulating on social media - while the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) referee denies inappropriate conduct.

The video [appears to show a man with a striking resemblance to Coote](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/premier-league-launch-investigation-david-30346072) deliver an expletive-laden rant about [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and Jurgen Klopp. In the footage, the male can be heard calling Liverpool "s\*\*\*" while calling Klopp a "c\*\*\*". It is unclear when the video was made or how it came into circulation, and it has not been verified.

Coote vehemently denies inappropriate conduct and has been insistent to referee chiefs PGMOL that viral video in which he appears is not genuine. PGMOL have tech experts examining it, it is understood.

Asked for his opinion of Klopp by the recorder of the footage, the man in question appears to say: "A c\*\*t, an absolute (unintelligible). Aside from having a right pop at me when I reffed them against Burnley in lockdown, when he accused me of lying the just had a right f\*\*\*ing pop at me.

**READ MORE: [First pictures of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United as new head coach arrives in England](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/first-pictures-ruben-amorim-manchester-30340249)**

"I've got no interest in speaking to somebody who is f\*\*\*ing arrogant. So I do my best not to speak to him. (James) Milner is all right. But, my God, a German c\*\*\*t, f\*\*\* me."

A photograph on a phone seemingly to depict Klopp, Milner and an official is at one stage shown to the camera. A second video appears to show the man saying: "Just to be clear, that last f\*\*\*ing video can't go anywhere, seriously."

A statement from PGMOL said: "David Coote has been suspended with immediate effect pending a full investigation. PGMOL will be making no further comment until that process is complete."

The FA and Liverpool have both been approached for comment.

Coote officiated Liverpool's 2-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday. The last [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) game he presided over was the 2-1 defeat to West Ham on October 27, in which a controversial stoppage-time penalty was awarded and converted.

Coote was told by VAR Michael Oliver to give a penalty to the Hammers after judging Matthijs De Ligt to have fouled Danny Ings. Coote had initially waved away protests at the time of the incident.

The 42-year-old also officiated United's goalless draw with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on September 21. Coote, a member of the Nottinghamshire Football Association, has refereed United on 10 occasions, including the 2023 [League Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-cup) final win over Newcastle United.

Ruud van Nistelrooy's interim spell as head coach of [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) is over. Four games, three wins, one draw and 11 goals has somewhat revived United's season.

The Dutchman replaced Erik ten Hag two weeks ago after the club decided the time was right for change. Following the 5-2 win over Leicester City in the EFL Cup, Ruben Amorim's appointment was confirmed and Van Nistelrooy was told he would be in interim charge for just three more games.

A 1-1 draw with Chelsea was followed by a 2-0 win over PAOK in the Europa League and 3-0 drubbing of Leicester. [Scenes at the final whistle at Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/saw-ruud-van-nistelrooy-gesture-30338951) resembled a figure of someone saying goodbye to the supporters, [but no decision has been made yet.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/legend-club-ruben-amorim-hints-30341725)

"For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is the football club, and I'm here to support that in my role," he told the media on Sunday.

"And, as I said, I want to contribute doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

The question regarding Van Nistelrooy's future is one that has split opinion among supporters. With that in mind, our _Manchester Evening News_ writers deliver their verdicts on his future and whether he should be kept on...

### Tyrone Marshall

I certainly wouldn’t be against Van Nistelrooy staying. He has handled himself really well in these four games in charge, exudes class, gets the club and he clearly has talent as a coach. [The players all speak very highly of him.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruno-fernandes-explains-ruud-van-30342133)

So much of modern coaching is about relationships, however, and this will only work if Amorim really wants and values the contribution he can make. Do they see the game in the same way? Do they have similar ideas?

Amorim is bringing a lot of staff over with him and too many chefs can become a problem. Darren Fletcher is already that link between the academy and first team, as well as a link from the first team players to the management.

Van Nistelrooy will need a more prominent role and while it would be great to see him get one, he needs to have a long discussion with Amorim to ensure they are on the same wavelength, otherwise it will do more harm than good.

### Steven Railston

[I had the privilege of chatting with Van Nistelrooy after a recent press conference.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/spoke-ruud-van-nistelrooy-camera-30276786) Our exits from the Jimmy Murphy Building coincided by chance and we had an informal chat as we walked to the car park. By the time I got to my car, I couldn't help but want Van Nistelrooy to be kept as part of Amorim's staff and my stance on the matter hasn't really changed.

Van Nistelrooy is a class act. He's handled himself brilliantly in the last few weeks, he's steadied the ship and is hugely popular with the players. There is obvious merit in keeping him at Carrington, although I do understand why a clean break would be beneficial for Amorim. With that in mind, I think the compromise would be keeping him until the end of the season.

The 48-year-old could help Amorim as he settles into his role at United and could continue to act as a link between the players. At the end of the campaign, Van Nistelrooy's work would be done and he could pursue a career in management, which seems like a sensible compromise and perhaps the best option.

### George Smith

Van Nistelrooy oversaw three wins and one draw from his four games in interim charge, injecting a sense of confidence and belief back into the veins of United's players and fans. He was always going to earn the backing of the fans from the off because of his status as a player.

Van Nistelrooy clearly has the respect of the players, who bought into his methods, and having a familiar face they can turn to in Amorim's early days in charge should not do any harm at all.

United are about to enter another transitional period and Amorim could do far worse than being able to turn to a figure who knows the club inside out. Van Nistelrooy wears his heart on his sleeve and has displayed the passion levels over the past fortnight that every United supporter wants to see.

Amorim is expected to bring several members of his coaching team to Old Trafford with him, meaning it is currently unclear what role Van Nistelrooy might have to play in the Portuguese coach's plans. Nevertheless, having a figure as respected as the Dutchman in situ would represent a reliable pillar Amorim could lean on for advice and guidance as he finds his feet in England.

Van Nistelrooy has openly admitted he wants to stay and Amorim should be encouraged by that. Van Nistelrooy is United through and through.

### Josh Holland

It's a pretty difficult one to get your head around but, for me, it comes down to whether Amorim wants to start with a clean slate or ensure the players have some sort of comfort blanket around them under his management.

Van Nistelrooy, obviously, is a popular figure inside the United dressing room. Under Ten Hag, you often saw him having individual chats and sharing jokes with individuals. After all, for many, he's a legend for his goalscoring days. However, can you really move forward with a mixture of the empire that sat before you?

Amorim is expected to bring his own coaching staff to Manchester meaning Van Nistelrooy's position in the dug-out is unknown. If he is informed that he won't be needed, it may be an unpopular call. But I honestly believe Amorim's best chance at succeeding at United is by starting fresh.

For Van Nistelrooy, he won't be short of offers. His short spell in charge will certainly have put eyes on his services, especially as we enter the time of year when clubs are considering a change.

### Amie Wilson

Ruben Amorim’s arrival means that a difficult decision needs to be made over the future of Ruud van Nistelrooy. He has no doubt done a good job as interim manager with three wins and a draw from his four games, but it feels like his future may be away from Old Trafford.

With Amorim bringing his own staff with him, it feels like can Nistelrooy will be shoehorned in for the sake of keeping a club legend at the club if he stays. There is such a thing as too many cooks spoil the broth.

Van Nistelrooy does have managerial experience with PSV and was linked with jobs before arriving back at Old Trafford in the summer. I can see him getting a chance with a club before the end of the season as managerial changes start to be made.

His time in charge of United, only if it was short, will do him no harm. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him take over at a lower Premier League club, or a side challenging for promotion in the Championship.

### Stephen Killen

All roads seem to point to a departure for Ruud van Nistelrooy. While it was short and sweet, he proved his capabilities in the dugout at Old Trafford.

But he made it no secret of his ambition to become a head coach and that could scupper his hopes of staying on in Greater Manchester. With that in mind, he has to go and earn his crust in the hotseat after only managing a mere 50 senior matches at PSV Eindhoven before taking temporary charge of United.

In order to avoid falling by the wayside, Van Nistelrooy has to strike while the iron is hot and put himself in the shop window for a managerial role, in order to stake his claim in the Premier League - which may be a job too soon.

### Jake Stokes

Ruud van Nistelrooy should part ways with Manchester United and let Ruben Amorim take full control. While he's done a good job as interim boss, it's time for him to move on and further prove himself as a head coach.

The Dutchman proved that he's more than capable of taking the reins during his time at PSV Eindhoven, so he should step out of his comfort zone. Equally, the Red Devils mustn't let emotions cloud their judgement.

Van Nistelrooy is a club legend, but that doesn't mean he has a right to stay in the dugout. Amorim has his own staff, and he got on just fine at Sporting! It's time for United to just move on and turn a new page. It's these type of decisions that have held the club back for so long.

Former Watford and Birmingham City striker Troy Deeney believes he is at risk of 'sending the internet into meltdown' after including Bruno Fernandes in his [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) Team of the Week.

The [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) captain scored for the fourth time in four games on Sunday, helping the Reds beat Leicester City 3-0 at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

The Portuguese international scored the game's opening goal with 17 minutes on the clock, bending home a terrific effort from the edge of the penalty area after being expertly teed up by [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo).

[Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) also had a big say in United's second goal, seeing a header go into the net off Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen. He then supplied Alejandro Garnacho to score United's third goal in the closing stages.

Having stepped up in big moments in the game, Deeney, who is now a pundit, selected the United captain for a place in his Team of the Week, insisting he is worthy of his inclusion for the way he stepped up at key stages.

"Here's where we send the internet into meltdown because I'm dropping Bruno back to play alongside Joelinton," said Deeney, naming his Premier League Team of the Week for [BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ckg06j18mvro?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0Y3elkgEbnKFvMULmBHl5sYJ1AYdNPn7nj6MzfDTfpCilq-1g0UNdK-GI_aem_YG2v9mC517LmxDQbURZk0w). "He wasn't great throughout the game but at critical stages he scores massive goals.

"He just settles it down when they need him. He's had his leadership questioned a lot but he came out after the game and spoke well about his teammate, Alejandro Garnacho."

Scoring four goals in four games under United interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy, Fernandes has stepped up since Erik ten Hag was sacked last month. He scored twice in the Carabao Cup win over Leicester, converted a penalty in the 1-1 draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) and scored again against the Foxes on Sunday.

Sunday's win over the Midlands outfit also marked his 250th appearance in United colours. He has scored 83 goals during that time.

Manchester United star [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) has sent a wordless message to interim manager [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) after the Dutchman took charge of his fourth and final game.

United ended his stint in charge in the perfect way, [with a 3-0 home win against Leicester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-amad-30338793). Goals from Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, and an own goal from Victor Kristiansen ensured all three points would stay at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

After his two goals against PAOK in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday night, Amad was chosen in the starting lineup against Leicester. He repaid Van Nistelrooy’s faith in him by providing an assist for Feranandes’ opener in the first half.

Taking to social media after the game, the winger posted a picture of him sharing an embrace with the interim boss at full-time. He wrote the caption “Important win, see you soon.”

> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCM0P_Bsorb/?img_index=1/embed)

Although the caption doesn’t mention Van Nistelrooy, the fact he chose the picture of the two together at full-time speaks volumes for the relationship between the coach and the player. Speaking about Amad following his brace against PAOK, Van Nistelrooy was full of praise.

“He’s a great character, he’s a hard worker,” he said.

“He shows that in every training session, that attitude, and also extra work. Every day after training he comes to me and he wants to do extra finishing, extra crossing, extra one v ones.

“‘How can I improve my shot?’ ‘How can I improve my heading?, etc, etc, etc. He’s constantly focused on learning, getting better, living very professional, in a professional way, so he’s very motivated to get the maximum out of his career.”

Amad will now look to make a similar impression on new head coach Ruben Amorim. The new boss arrives from Sporting this week and will take charge of his first game after the international break when United travel to Ipswich.

Ruben Amorim is officially the head coach of [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) with his reign at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) starting this week. After managing his final game at Sporting CP on Sunday, the Portuguese now turns his attention to the Red Devils.

The final international break of 2024 means Amorim's first game in charge isn't until November 24. Fortunately, there is a better feeling around Carrington after [Ruud van Nistelrooy managed three wins in four games.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/legend-club-ruben-amorim-hints-30341725)

Sunday's 3-0 thrashing of Leicester City means United are only four points behind Arsenal in fourth. Between now and the New Year, Amorim will take charge of 11 games, a period of fixtures that could mould how the 2024/25 season plays out.

With many players away on international duty for the first week of Amorim's reign, there are a number of players still unavailable due to injury. Here, we have taken a look at the latest injury news ahead of the Ipswich Town game.

### Leny Yoro

**Injury:** Fractured metatarsal

The former Lille man, who joined United in the summer, has been unavailable since fracturing his metatarsal in the opening game of United's pre-season tour of the United States in July.

[Yoro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/leny-yoro) trained with the rest of his teammates at Carrington last week, providing a strong indication that he is edging closer towards making his competitive debut for the club.

United anticipated he would be sidelined for around three months after undergoing surgery at the start of August. [He was walking without crutches as soon as early-September](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/leny-yoro-moves-step-closer-29884169). United, last month, said his return would not be rushed.

**Possible return date:** November.

### Kobbie Mainoo

**Injury:** Muscle

Mainoo suffered a muscle injury in the 0-0 draw with Villa and has now missed the last seven matches. Before the win over Leicester, Van Nistelrooy confirmed he was progressing well.

"Kobbie is also progressing in his injury, he's making the right steps, but it is not yet with the team, though. That needs a bit more time."

**Possible return date:** November 24 vs Ipswich Town.

### Casemiro

**Injury:** Knock

Casemiro came off on Sunday in the 79th minute after seeming to pick up some sort of knock. After kneeling down and in conversation with the referee, the Brazilian was replaced by Christian Eriksen.

He walked off the pitch without any assistance, clapping the United badge as he thanked supporters for their support. Casemiro isn't in the Brazil squad meaning he will receive a much-needed rest.

### Harry Maguire

**Injury:** Foot

[Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) has been absent since being forced off against Aston Villa last month. He limped off the field, requiring support from members of the United medical team, and was replaced by Matthijs de Ligt just before half-time.

Maguire posted on social media that he would be out for 'a few weeks'. He has missed the last five matches.

Last week, Van Nistelrooy said: "Harry is still inside working on his rehab."

**Possible return date:** November.

### Luke Shaw

**Injury:** Calf

Shaw's wait to play for the first time this season continues. It's understood that he is now closing in on a return but it isn't yet known when that will be.

"Luke \[is\] also doing pitch work like he did today," Van Nistelrooy said last week. "He's progressing \[and will\] hopefully \[be in\] partial team training soon."

**Possible return date:** Unknown

### Tyrell Malacia

**Injury:** Knee

[Malacia](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/tyrell-malacia) has now been training with the first-team for several weeks, offering encouragement that his return might not be all that far away. He last played for United on the final day of the 2022/23 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) season.

He was part of the 25-man squad that trained at Carrington last week and Van Nistelrooy has said the next step for his fellow countryman is to try and get some minutes under his belt via the Under-21s.

"Tyrell is the furthest \[along\], he's part of team training for a couple of weeks now, fly in team training, no restrictions," said Van Nistelrooy. "It's good for him to plan game minutes, maybe in the Under-21s, we have to see."

**Possible return date:** Unknown.

### Mason Mount

**Injury:** Knock

After missing seven matches, [Mount](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/mason-mount) returned to action in last week's win over PAOK, playing nine minutes. He was an unused substitute in the win over Leicester City.

He was involved in the opening training session at Carrington on Wednesday morning, meaning he could be considered for selection against PAOK. He last played on September 29.

**Possible return date:** Returned.

### Toby Collyer

**Injury:** Unknown

Explaining why Jack Fletcher had been included in the squad for the win over Brentford last month, Ten Hag revealed [Collyer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/toby-collyer) was another midfielder who had been added to the injury list. However, he stopped short of offering any detail on the nature or extent of his injury.

The _[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-receive-injury-blow-30273174)_ now understands he will be unavailable for 'roughly a month'.

**Possible return date:** December.

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) are investigating a video circulating on social media that allegedly shows David Coote disrespecting [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) and their former manager Jurgen Klopp.

The video surfaced online on Monday, days after the official took charge of the Reds' 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Anfield. In light of the encounter, the referee has come under fire for his decision-making during the contest, which saw Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah fire Arne Slot's side to the top of the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

The video appears to show Coote, with another man, discussing Liverpool and, in particular, their former manager. With the 42-year-old supposedly using expletives to describe the club and words of a derogatory nature to the Premier League and Champions League-winning tactician.

Coote has been a [Premier League](https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) referee since 2018, having overseen EFL games for eight years before that. In Saturday's clash between Liverpool and Aston Villa, there were a host of key talking points. Leon Bailey was adjudged to have not fouled Mohamed Salah, despite being the last man, in the build-up to the opener.

Unai Emery's side also had three penalty appeals waved away, including a coming together between Ibrahima Konate and Ollie Watkins - as well as two complaints from Pau Torres in the box.

Liverpool, the Premier League and the FA have all been contacted for comment.

Manchester United captain [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) has explained how interim manager [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) brought the ‘joy’ back to training following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.

Van Nistelrooy ended his four match stint in interim charge of the club on a high on Sunday. Goals from Fernandes and [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho) gave United a comfortable 3-0 win over Leicester City at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

It means that the Dutchman remains unbeaten with three wins and a draw from his four matches in charge. He will now hand over the reins to incoming manager [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim).

Speaking after the win against Leicester, Fernandes, who has scored four goals and assisted a further two in the last four games, has explained how the interim boss approached training.

"It's been a big part, obviously, he felt that everyone was a little bit down," the captain told [MUTV](https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/bruno-fernandes-discusses-what-ruud-van-nistelrooy-brought-to-training). "Results, everything that succeeded with the manager. He understood that the momentum of the players is not great. The mood was down, the confidence was down, so everything he did every day in training, it was trying to bring joy to the training.

"You know, like trying to bring smiles, trying to be involved, tried to make everyone enjoy it, and make it look a little bit loose, the training. And he brought a lot of energy from that, you know, he brought people fighting, training, running, trying duels and lots of small games, competitions, and that.

"Probably going forward, you needed to do more tactics and whatever," he added. "For him, in the moment, \[it\] was just he did it, to be honest, and the training has been really enjoyable. Everyone is feeling like they enjoying the training because he was just bringing that extra joy to the training.

"And I like \[that\], with small things with small games, just to bring the energy back. And he did it. He did it well. And we said it before the game, we don't know what's going to happen to Ruud and the rest of the staff.”

Van Nistelrooy’s future at Old Trafford still looks uncertain. The former striker has revealed that he will be told a final decision on if he stays or not on Monday.

"I appreciated the clear communication of the club, that it was interim for the short term," [he said](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-reveals-manchester-30340119). "It could've been one or two games even, that was the first communication, and they kept me in the loop and said okay, it's gonna be four \[games\].

"For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is this football club, and I'm here to support that in my role.

"And, as I said, I want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

Ruben Amorim will travel to England on Monday to start work as the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) head coach.

[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) will take charge of Sporting for the final time this evening away to Braga in the Primeira Liga, having agreed to become [Erik ten Hag's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) permanent replacement last week.

The 39-year-old will not be able to conduct training sessions at United until he has obtained a visa, which is yet to come through. United sources expect the visa to be processed quickly and then Amorim can "get on the grass".

Any potential delay is unlikely to be problematic as Amorim will not conduct a full team training session until next week when United's international players start to return.

Several senior players will be immediately available to Amorim. Marcus Rashford, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire, Casemiro, Amad, Mason Mount, Antony and the fit-again Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw could be among the first players to meet Amorim.

Diogo Dalot, Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Alejandro Garnacho, Christian Eriksen, Rasmus Hojlund, Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Noussair Mazraoui, Victor Lindelof, Manuel Ugarte, Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir will all be on international duty over the next fortnight.

Uruguay and Argentina's second World Cup qualifiers kick off in the early hours of Wednesday November 20, so the earliest Amorim could have every United player available is on November 21 - three days before his first match in charge away to Ipswich Town.

United have not scheduled an introductory press conference for Amorim this week. His first engagement with the press could be at Carrington in what would effectively be the pre-match press conference for the Ipswich fixture.

Viktor Gyokeres should move to Manchester United after proving the gap between the Championship and the top flight isn't that vast.

That is the view of former United forward Andy Cole, who himself made the successful transition from a goalscorer in the Old Division One to a goalscorer in the Premier League at Newcastle United.

That convinced United to splash the cash on Cole in the winter of 1995 and he went on to win nine major trophies at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

**READ MORE: [Ruben Amorim has two unexpected Man United undroppables - thanks to Ruud van Nistelrooy decision](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-two-unexpected-man-30338961)**

Gyokeres was prolific at Championship level for Coventry City and since making the move to Sporting CP in Portugal he has kicked on to new heights.

The 26-year-old has scored 66 goals in 68 games for the Portuguese champions, including 21 goals in 18 games this season in all competitions.

With former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim taking over as Manchester United manager today, speculation is rife that Gyokeres could follow him at the end of the season, given the goalscoring struggles of forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.

And Cole believes he should make the move, if United can stay within their FFP limits, and has backed him to be a success for United.

“A lot of teams will look abroad at players and think 'they could play in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league)', but there’s a lot of players in the Championship that could be given the same opportunity," Cole told [Betfred.](https://insights.betfred.com/newsroom/andy-cole-ruben-amorim-needs-to-hit-the-ground-running-at-manchester-united/)

"That’s the way I view it. Gyökeres has moved from the Championship to a league abroad and has excelled, so I do ask myself sometimes whether the gap is actually that big. I don’t believe it is. The championship is a difficult league at the best of times, so if you can score goals there, then you should be able to go abroad and do the same.

“If they want to sign him, then should he come to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc)? Yes, why not? That decision, however, will be down to the manager and finances. FFP’s not easy and Manchester United have spent a hell of a lot of money. We’ll just have to wait and see.”

Morten Hjulmand showed his true colours following Ruben Amorim's final appearance in the dugout for Sporting CP. The 39-year-old took charge of his last game for the Portuguese outfit on Sunday night, [masterminding a dramatic 4-2 win over Braga](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruno-fernandes-explains-ruud-van-30342133).

Sporting trailed 2-0 at the break, with Ricardo Horta netting a brace. Determined to bow out in style, [Amorim made wholesale changes before the hour mark](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/im-former-man-united-forward-30342431), bringing on Jeremiah St. Juste, Conrad Harder and Hidemasa Morita.

The latter, who replaced Daniel Bragança, halved the deficit just moments after entering the fray. Leading by example, [Hjulmand netted an equaliser with less than 10 minutes to play](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-joshua-zirkzee-30341712), blowing the tie wide open.

In the final minutes, Harder fired Sporting into the lead after combining well with Morita. Then, late into stoppage time, [the 19-year-old striker doubled his tally](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/matthijs-de-ligt-makes-demand-30342033) after catching Braga on the counter-attack.

Upon the final whistle, [Amorim was swamped by his players after inspiring a fairytale comeback](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/legend-club-ruben-amorim-hints-30341725). Speaking to reporters after the game, Hjulmand revealed that he and his teammates were eager to part ways with the new [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss on a high.

Revealing the Portuguese tactician's half-time team talk, as quoted by [UIF](https://www.unitedinfocus.com/opinion/ruben-amorim-amped-up-sir-alex-ferguson-and-man-utd-dna-noise-with-what-sporting-did-in-his-final-game-as-manager/), the Sporting captain said: "In the first half, it was not Sporting standard. At half-time, we spoke and we wanted to give Amorim a win for his last game so we are very happy."

Earlier this month, Hjulmand raised eyebrows after it was first revealed that Amorim would replace Erik ten Hag at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). The 25-year-old midfielder said: "I see it as a positive challenge to try to be champions without Ruben, which is the main objective of this season.

"Life goes on and we want to show that we no longer need him. It was difficult for me to know that he is leaving. I was sad. That he was going to leave me too. But in football, opportunities like these happen to players and coaches. It's part of football and I hope Ruben is proud to receive an offer of this kind."

Hjulmand added: "Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting. When you are coached by him, you get a clear idea of the way he sees football and how he sees us being part of the team. It's a very important image for the player, to know what his role is, what he can contribute to the team.

"It was very important when I joined Sporting. The way he sees the players, how he manages the team on and off the field... It's something I've never seen in my career. Manchester United will be in good hands with Ruben."

Interestingly, Hjulmand was linked with a move to United in the summer as Ten Hag looked to bolster his midfield. According to [Football Transfers](https://www.footballtransfers.com/en/transfer-news/uk-premier-league/2024/07/man-utd-transfer-news-red-devils-consider-sporting-cp-midfielder-as-psg-maintain-ugarte-price), the Dane was shortlisted by the Red Devils, who later signed Manuel Ugarte instead.

Alan Shearer believes Ruud van Nistelrooy is set to bid farewell to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc).

The Dutchman returned to his former club as Erik ten Hag’s assistant coach in the summer, 18 years after leaving [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) as a player. [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) would have wanted the team to enjoy a better start to the season but helped restore the feel-good factor in his four-game spell as interim boss, signing off with a 3-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday.

Despite his brief success in the United dugout, it is currently unclear whether there will be a role for Van Nistelrooy [under new manager Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/legend-club-ruben-amorim-hints-30341725). Offering his theory on United’s dilemma, [Shearer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alan-shearer) thinks the former PSV Eindhoven boss should reignite his managerial career, which would also suit Amorim as he heads to [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

**READ MORE:** [**Ruben Amorim has two unexpected Man United undroppables - thanks to Ruud van Nistelrooy decision**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-two-unexpected-man-30338961)

“He’s a big personality, you get the feeling he wants to be a number one,” Shearer said on the [The Rest Is Football](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OYPmdlLlKeQ6c05Y1WQzG?si=TB01G4BJTPe6TqQRmZLchQ) podcast. “He wants to be a manager. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he was to have a clean break and say, ‘I’ve done what was asked of me, thank you very much’, and Amorim came in and had a clean sweep. He's bringing all his own people in.

“Then Ruud can go and find himself a number one job somewhere. He’s done himself no harm at all. In fact, he’s done a great job. He’s done everything asked of him and more. He’s settled the ship, he’s picked up points as they had to do, he’s got the results as they had to do.

“Everyone knows how much he loves Man United and they love him. That’s not going to change. So it wouldn’t surprise me if he shook hands and said, ‘Thanks very much’.”

Shearer’s thoughts were echoed by Gary Lineker, who described the prospect of Amorim finding a space for Van Nistelrooy as potentially awkward. Lineker continued: "It also wouldn't surprise me if Ruben Amorim comes in and goes 'do you really want someone who's been part of the previous regime in there?'

"Especially a big personality like that, and where do you place him, is he first assistant? I think it might be a little bit awkward and I suspect like you Alan, he might go elsewhere." However, fellow pundit Micah Richards thought that the United hero should be kept around due to his bond with the players and fans.

That connection was on full display on Sunday, with the Old Trafford crowd continually serenading Van Nistelrooy, who approached the [Stretford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stretford) End at full-time. The 48-year-old admitted that moment gave closure to his interim reign and he expected to hear about his future shortly, having previously received clear communication from the United hierarchy.

"For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is this football club, and I'm here to support that in my role,” [Van Nistelrooy explained](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-reveals-manchester-30340119).

"And, as I said, I want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

Ruud van Nistelrooy said his double substitution early in the second half was "necessary" as [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) beat Leicester City 3-0.

Van Nistelrooy decided in the 50th minute to send on Jonny Evans and Alejandro Garnacho and the pair came on for Diogo Dalot and Marcus Rashford seven minutes later.

Evans slotted in at centre back and Noussair Mazraoui switched from left back to right back as Lisandro Martinez shifted to left back. Garnacho was a straight swap for Rashford on the left wing.

Dalot has started in all 18 of United's matches this season as specialist left backs Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia have remained sidelined. Rashford has only started on the bench twice this term and has gone eight games without a goal.

Garnacho curled in his seventh goal of the season and his second during Van Nistelrooy's four-game interim spell. The 20-year-old is United's top scorer this term and had started their previous seven matches, having started 38 successive games last season.

"The timing was I felt it was necessary in today’s game to make those changes," Van Nistelrooy explained. "Players who had played so many minutes in so many games because of the thin squad, they need also replacing to keep them fit and to keep them healthy.

"And there are other players in the squad who are back. Jonny Evans, fantastic, comes in and does the job. And Lisandro going to left back and doing their jobs.

"I spoke to Alejandro before the game: 'You're playing so much, so many games, so many minutes, I want you fresh from the bench to make a difference as a sub.'

"It was the reality we were in and good to have many more players on board like Christian Eriksen who could step in for Casemiro, who has also played almost everything over the last period."

Ruben Amorim has already been dealt his first inconvenience as [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) head coach. The 39-year-old took charge of his final game for Sporting CP on Sunday night, [leading the Portuguese giants to a dramatic 4-2 win over Braga](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-make-surprise-chelsea-30341231).

Eager to get his feet under the table at Carrington, he's expected to touch down in Manchester on Monday. However, [Amorim cannot lead his first training session until he obtains a visa](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-plans-first-day-30339898), which the **Manchester Evening News** understands is yet to come through.

It's believed that the club expect the visa to be processed quickly. **Manchester Evening News** also understands that [any potential delay is unlikely to be problematic](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-plans-first-day-30339898) as Amorim will not conduct a full first-team training session until players begin to return from international duty.

**READ MORE: [Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes feelings on Bruno Fernandes clear ahead of Ruben Amorim arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sir-jim-ratcliffe-makes-man-30339251)**

While the Portuguese tactician will initially be without the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Lisandro Martinez, [some big names will be immediately available upon his arrival](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/amorim-without-man-utd-players-30340802). Marcus Rashford, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire, Mason Mount, Antony, Casemiro and Amad could be the first players to meet their new boss.

Leny Yoro, who's recently returned from injury, and Luke Shaw could also be among those to welcome Amorim to Carrington. Speaking to [MUTV](https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/bruno-fernandes-discusses-what-ruud-van-nistelrooy-brought-to-training) following United's 3-0 win over Leicester City, [Fernandes revealed what Ruud van Nistelrooy's training sessions have been like since taking the reins](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-two-unexpected-man-30338961).

"He understood that the momentum of the players is not great," said the United skipper. "The mood was down, the confidence was down, so everything he did every day in training, it was trying to bring joy to the training.

"You know, like trying to bring smiles, trying to be involved, tried to make everyone enjoy it and make it look a little bit loose - the training. And he brought a lot of energy from that, you know, he brought people fighting, training, running, trying duels and lots of small games, competitions and that."

On what he wants from training sessions at Carrington ahead of Amorim's arrival, Fernandes added: "Probably going forward, you needed to do more tactics and whatever. "For him, in the moment, \[it\] was just he did it, to be honest, and the training has been really enjoyable.

"Everyone is feeling like they are enjoying the training because he was just bringing that extra joy to the training. And I like \[that\], with small things with small games, just to bring the energy back. And he did it. He did it well. And we said it before the game, we don't know what's going to happen to Ruud and the rest of the staff.

"We don't know who’s going to stay, who doesn’t, and we said it before the game. If this has to be one last dance, it has to be a proper one, because they deserve it for everything they did for us."

Some Man United players' futures are becoming more certain as valuation changes - Samuel Luckhurst
==================================================================================================

Man United now have to get into the habit of not letting the manager solely decide players' futures. That forward planning has already started.

The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on [Harry Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) but [Ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about-erik-ten-hag) made it about Maguire.

"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it," Ten Hag said with relief. "You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four."

Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager.

Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.

**READ MORE: [History is starting to repeat itself with the United manager](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/history-starting-repeat-itself-manchester-29000120)**

**EXCLUSIVE: [Some United players delaying decisions on futures](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-players-delaying-decisions-28992949)**

Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.

Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.

The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.

At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.

Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.

This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.

  

![Image 4: Maguire soldiered on at Bournemouth](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29009808.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2147781724.jpg)

Maguire soldiered on at Bournemouth

Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.

Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.

Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.

United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.

  

![Image 5: Casemiro struggled again at the weekend](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29009809.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2148536142.jpg)

Casemiro struggled again at the weekend

Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.

Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.

United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.

Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.

However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.

Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.

A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. "When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million."

Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc).

They encountered it in [Erik ten Hag's first window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news), when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. "You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money," Murtough was told.

**ALSO READ: [Ten Hag has hinted at biggest United change this summer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-hinted-biggest-29106572)**

The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.

That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for [Casemiro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/casemiro) and Antony a couple of years ago.

This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.

In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.

United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.

Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.

It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.

That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.

Why Erik ten Hag is in a more secure position than previous Manchester United managers
======================================================================================

Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.

Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) can.

The misfiring [Antony](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/antony) is not assured of keeping his place and [Christian Eriksen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/christian-eriksen), back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.

Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.

**READ MORE: [Only one United centre half is certain of staying next season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/only-one-manchester-united-centre-28328724)**

**READ MORE: [Eight United players face an uncertain winter transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/eight-manchester-united-players-facing-28324556)**

De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.

As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.

That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.

There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.

Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.

The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.

The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.

  

![Image 4: Mourinho was named United manager five months after scarves were sold bearing his name and face](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article10680412.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS79409966.jpg)

Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.

There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.

Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.

  

![Image 5: Potter is not a credible threat to Ten Hag for now](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article24693798.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-1413423123.jpg)

Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.

United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.

Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.

That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.

There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.

[Sancho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho) has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.

Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.

**ALSO READ:** **[Dan Gore's journey to United debut](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scoring-100-goals-season-sharing-28278214)**

"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards," said Ten Hag two weeks ago. "What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen."

Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.

Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.

Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and [Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nemanja-matic-claims-jadon-sancho-28228919) to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.

Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, [Raphael Varane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/raphael-varane) this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.

He wrote: "As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.

"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.

"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things."

It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.

Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.

The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.

Sir Dave Brailsford is sounding out former staff at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) as the Ineos Group prepares to make sweeping changes at the club.

[Brailsford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/dave-brailsford), the Ineos sporting director, is conducting thorough due diligence and a source has suggested the changes at United could be "brutal".

United sources say Brailsford has been attending meetings this month to gauge the performance challenge at United, whose title drought is certain to tick past 12 years.

Although Ineos plan to hire a sporting director and potentially a head of recruitment, the incumbent football director John Murtough wants to remain at the club.

A club source said in December it was "in the balance" as to whether Murtough stays at United or ends his decade-long association with the club.

**READ MORE: [How the United squad will look after the transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/what-manchester-united-squad-look-28456366)**

The Manchester Evening News revealed last month [Ineos are open to retaining Murtough in a more administrative role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ineos-target-dan-ashworth-stance-28308415) and Murtough never envisaged his role at United to centre on recruitment.

United have backed manager Erik ten Hag with investment of more than £400million on signings and sources have stressed they were tracking certain targets before the Dutchman was appointed in April 2022.

However, Murtough feels his involvement in picking players has been limited and six of Ten Hag's permanent additions played in the Eredivisie.

Brailsford and Jean Claude Blanc, the Ineos chief executive for sport, are due to join the United football board. A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.

Blanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday.

### Go Inside Old Trafford

"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.

Tyler and Jack were regulars in the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.

The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, [Darren](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher). The [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.

The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.

Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.

It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.

Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.

If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.

Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.

It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.

Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.

Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.

The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.

Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.

Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.

The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.

Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.

United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to "keep it as low-key as possible", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.

Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.

On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.

Scoring 100 goals a season and sharing a Roy Keane trait - Dan Gore's Manchester United journey

Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) debut.

Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.

“It tops the list of birthdays," Gore said while trying to keep his composure. "I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything."

**ALSO READ: [Exclusive interview with Travis Binnion](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kobbie-mainoo-brave-elite-ball-28202690)**

Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.

He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.

Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised [Wayne Rooney](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney) and [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo) when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.

"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight," Lewis Craig told the _Manchester Evening News_. "Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.

"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.

"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.

  

![Image 3: Dan Gore](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article28297835.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1702936628.jpg)

"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f\*\*\*\*\*\* horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years."

Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. "My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad," Craig said when asked about his position change.

"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.

"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.

"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then."

Gore (centre, bottom row) with Burnley's academy.

Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.

"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching," Hargreaves said.

"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.

"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.

"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day."

Hargreaves continued: "His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.

  

![Image 5](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article28293942.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Gore1.png)

"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.

"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win."

The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.

"He’s captain material I'd say," Craig added. "Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.

"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.

"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting."

Gore playing for the academy in 2019.

Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.

"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays," Craig said. "I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.

"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now."

Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. "I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.

"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.

"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him."

  

![Image 7](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article28298882.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Youth.png)

Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. [Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dan-gore-man-united-fernandes-27802126) has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.

"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die," Craig said. "Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.

"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text."

Hargreaves echoed those comments: "It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way."

Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.

Manchester United are planning to keep [Amad](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/amad-diallo) beyond the closure of the January transfer window.

United [expect Facundo Pellistri to join Granada](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-expecting-facundo-pellistri-28460620) on loan and believe Amad has an important role to play in the squad.

Amad, 21, made his first United appearance in more than two years as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest on January 30.

The Ivory Coast international missed the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) third round win against [Wigan Athletic](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/wigan-athletic-fc) through illness and he could return to the squad for the fourth round tie at Newport County next week.

United signed Amad for £19million rising to £37m from Atalanta on [transfer deadline day](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/transfer-deadline-day) in October 2020 and the winger has played 10 times for the club.

**EXCLUSIVE: [Brailsford meeting former United staff with 'brutal' changes planned](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sir-dave-brailsford-meeting-former-28459398)**

Amad spent the second half of the 2021-22 season on loan at Rangers and shone during a season-long loan at Sunderland last term. Amad scored 14 goals in 42 games for the Championship side as Sunderland reached the play-offs.

Pellistri was due to leave on loan in the summer but ended up remaining at United after Amad sustained a knee injury in the pre-season win against Arsenal in July.

Amad returned to training in early December and he performed creditably off the bench in the loss at Forest.

Casemiro has revealed that the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) dressing room want Ruben Amorim to lead them to [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) glory. The 39-year-old took charge of his final game for Sporting CP on Sunday evening, bowing out in a dramatic 4-2 win over Braga.

Eager to get the ball rolling at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), he's expected to touch down in Manchester on Monday. While the Portuguese tactician won't lead a full first-team training session at Carrington until players begin to return from international duty, [he'll still be greeted by some big names](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-cant-take-training-30341496).

One of which being Casemiro, who's [heard good things about his new boss](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/we-cannot-ignore-casemiro-offers-30342257). Speaking to reporters following the Red Devils' win over Leicester City, the 32-year-old midfielder revealed he and his teammates hope to climb to the top of the table under Amorim.

As quoted by the [Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-ruben-amorim-players-34081246), Casemiro said: "The best thing is that everyone speaks highly of him. He marked an era at Sporting, at a time when FC Porto were the winners. Sporting are always among the three favourites, but they are usually a little behind Benfica and FC Porto, who are usually stronger. He marked an era, [won titles and had a brilliant career at Sporting](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/sporting-wonderkid-ruben-amorim-wants-30342901). Everyone speaks highly of him."

He added: "He will have an exceptional group here, who want to help, who want to continue growing, who want to learn, who want to be at the top of the table. [We are waiting for him with great joy and happiness](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-three-young-players-30342301)."

United are currently 13th in the Premier League, but they're only four points off Arsenal in fourth. The Red Devils are also in the Carabao Cup quarter-final and remain in contention for qualification to the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) knockout stages.

Nevertheless, ahead of his arrival at United, Amorim has claimed he's 'ready for the new challenge'. As quoted by [TNT Sports](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/premier-league/2024-2025/ruben-amorim-ready-challenge-not-naive-manchester-united-sporting-ruud-van-nistelrooy-formation_sto20053047/story.shtml), he said: "I feel ready for the new challenge. I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough, but I feel that I am ready.

"I'm at peace now. I can focus on my new job, and I'm looking forward to starting tomorrow," added Amorim. "I know how I am going to play in the beginning, because you have to start with a structure that you know and then you will adapt with the players that you have,” he said.

"Injuries or no injuries, what kind of players, the abilities to defend, to attack. I will discover that in the next few weeks. We don't have a lot of time to train so I have to show something that I know very well. So you can take whatever you want from that question."

When Alejandro Garnacho curled in a sensational goal in [Manchester United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) 3-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday, he didn't fully celebrate in front of the [Stretford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stretford) End.

The winger came off the bench at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) before killing the contest against Leicester City. However, his celebrations were muted and [his flat reaction was explained by Bruno Fernandes at full-time.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bruno-fernandes-takes-swipe-manchester-30337778)

"Garnacho scored a banger but didn't celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans," he told BBC Sport. "I told him people will always moan, but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.

"I told him to celebrate, it was something special. He is a special player, we have difference makers. They are the ones who win us games. We want them to score every game but that isn't going to happen."

It comes after a bizarre exchange with one fan that went viral on social media before the 2-0 [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) win over PAOK. After signing autographs for supporters as he waited at Old Trafford, the fan said: "Are you going to pass better today? Score a goal and work on your first touch." Garnacho looked understandably annoyed and responded, "Why are you not playing man?"

Now, following the victory over Leicester, a new video has emerged on social media that shows a nice moment between Garnacho and a young fan. The clip, uploaded on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@rachaelelizaabethh/video/7435712087642426656?_t=8rIsnDwZVUv&_r=1), shows one little boy singing Garnacho's 'Viva Garnacho' chant and receiving a thank you from the forward before replacing Marcus Rashford.

At full-time, the video then shows Garnacho come over to the boy, who was positioned close to the dug-out at Old Trafford, and present him with his match-worn shirt before hugging him.

The video ends with the little boy crying while hugging Garnacho's shirt inside the stadium and on his walk home.

Head coach Ruben Amorim has said he would like to try and have dinner with as many [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) greats as possible, including Sir [Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson).

[Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) United contract officially commences today (Monday) after he took charge of Sporting Lisbon for the final time on Sunday evening. He watched his side recover from 2-0 down to beat Braga 4-2 and sign off with three points.

Amorim, 39, is now waiting to obtain a visa to start work at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). His first game in charge will be against Ipswich Town at Portman Road in just under a fortnight's time.

Amorim is tasked with trying to bring the good times back to Old Trafford, and his appointment has generated a wave of fresh optimism around the surrounding streets of M16. It is hoped he will be able to replicate his success with Sporting at United.

After taking charge of Sporting for the final time on Sunday, Amorim was quizzed on his move to United and specifically which club legend he would like to meet up with most. One journalist put four names to him: Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Roy Ferdinand and Ferguson.

Amorim used the opportunity to laud the latter, praising the sterling work he did during his time in charge at Old Trafford, before admitting that he would like to have dinner with each of them.

Amorim said: "Alex Ferguson was someone very special, he's above everyone else at that club. But it would be difficult to choose anyone. I will try to have lunch and dinner with all of them."

Ruben Amorim officially begins his duties as Manchester United manager today, Monday November 11, and will make an immediate start on crafting his new squad to fit his vision.

Today has been over a week in the making since [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) was announced as the next permanent man in charge at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). In the time since he has overseen three final Sporting CP matches, including a 4-1 [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) victory over [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc), whilst [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) has been in interim charge since [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag)'s sacking 14 days ago.

In short, it has been a whirlwind time at [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) recently - a reflection of the past decade at the club, really - but now the key word of the Amorim era must be stability. The key aspect his predecessor struggled with most was the application of an on-field system. Albeit an ever-changing one, [Pep Guardiola](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola) has kept to a system.

As a student of the Man City boss, Mikel Arteta has developed his own and taken that to Arsenal. Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot have enjoyed success at Anfield with their methods of play. Even Unai Emery at Aston Villa too - it is no coincidence that all four of these clubs finished in the top last term, beating Man United and the rest, with clear, defined styles of play.

Ten Hag spent heavily on the players he thought would work in a 4-2-3-1 formation, though they failed to make the desired impact alongside existing Old Trafford stars. Now Amorim arrives with his 3-4-3 system that has served him so well in his homeland, but will have to get a tune out of this amalgamation of players headhunted by multiple prior managers.

"I know how I am going to play in the beginning, because you have to start with a structure that you know," the 39-year-old has already said. "Then you will adapt with the players that you have, some injuries, or no injuries, what kind of players have the abilities to defend, attack, I will discover that in the next few weeks. We don’t have a lot of time to train, so I have to show something that I know very well. You can take whatever you want from that."

He will get a decent taste of the squad across two weeks before they travel to Portman Road on their next [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) assignment. Here, **the Manchester Evening News** predicts which available players will make Amorim's first starting XI, who will face Ipswich Town...

### Goalkeeper - Onana

A first decision for the new manager and it seems like it should be a fairly straightforward one. He may face criticism at times, but Andre Onana is the goalkeeper with the most experience playing at a top level.

Both he and Altay Bayindir will be away with their national teams during the break, so it is not like the second-choice would have the opportunity to stake a claim.

### Defence - De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez

A change in defensive formation offers Harry Maguire the opportunity for an immediate return to the team.

The former captain has been sidelined since before the October internationals but is looking to use the new break to get back to match fitness. Placing him in the centre of a back three will negate extra need for pace and place greater emphasis on his ability to command a back line. The 31-year-old has plenty of experience that at least for now Amorim can put to use.

Then to the right of him Matthijs de Ligt, and to the left Lisandro Martinez. Both are younger and faster, so their capabilities suit the wider positions. They have struck up somewhat of a partnership so far this season therefore keeping them together will be advantageous in the long run.

Two out of the three choices offer a good amount of height, so on paper this seems like a sensible trio.

Of course this would mean denying Leny Yoro a first competitive start in the club's colours. Placing such demands on an 18-year-old returning from a particularly nasty injury might be too rash of a decision to begin with, so Amorim would be wise to cautiously build him up to taking Maguire's place over time.

### Midfield - Dalot , Mainoo, Ugarte, Mazraoui

Moving further upfield, Amorim is going to find further trouble building a jigsaw with pieces mixed together from different sets.

He typically likes to play with two central and two out wide. Getting to grips with the Premier League he might be wise to stick with a quartet that are comfortable defensively.

For these purposes full-backs Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are two more survivors from the team Van Nistelrooy last used against Leicester City. Both offer plenty going forwards as well as the ability to cover their central defenders.

Even if the latter is technically out of position, it again means not rushing Luke Shaw back into the fold from his recent fitness troubles.

In the middle, summer signing Manuel Ugarte retains his place having been a tried and tested former member of Amorim's Sporting side, then Casemiro becomes the first casualty as Kobbie Mainoo returns from injury to take his place. As a clearer cut central midfielder the 19-year-old would offer greater versatility in Man United's attacking and defensive efforts.

### Attack - Amad, Fernandes, Rashford

This leaves only three more places available for attackers - one central and two either side - in Amorim's ideal formation. He is due to be hit with a major reality check going from having Victor Gyokeres up front - a man who's every touch turns to gold - to a collection of goalscorers that haven't really been completing that task to the full effect.

When Amorim was announced over one week ago this prediction may have been simpler, but Amad has arguably played himself into the starting line-up. The 22-year-old has two goals and one assists in his last two outings, plus will have the benefit of training under the new coach for the duration of the November break, so deserves to keep his place.

On the opposite flank Marcus Rashford is in the same boat - he has not been called up by England so has the opportunity to learn under Amorim before the Ipswich game. Alejandro Garnacho may be the preferable option, but having him to bring from the bench would be a great weapon to have stored in the arsenal, especially as he is due to travel extensively to South America and back over the break.

And lastly this brings Amorim to the conundrum up front. Both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are currently away with their national teams, so won't have the same benefit Amad and Rashford have over the next two weeks.

If Amorim's system is going to work in the long run he is going to have to adapt and build the confidence of at least one of that duo into his ideal striker, but again, there is no rush.

The last spot could therefore go to Bruno Fernandes, who rather than being the man that runs in behind would play as a second striker. The captain can link the play between midfield and his wide attackers perhaps just this once, whilst being not too bad of a goalscorer himself.

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim insists he is aware of the size of the challenge that is waiting for him at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

[Amorim's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) United contract officially starts on Monday having taken charge of Sporting Lisbon for the final time on Sunday evening, overseeing a 4-2 come-from-behind win over Braga. [Amorim and members of his coaching team boarded a flight bound for Manchester on Monday morning](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-appears-confirm-manchester-30343983) and they are expected to start work at Old Trafford as soon as they have obtained work permits.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) quickly sounded Amorim out as their preferred candidate to replace Erik ten Hag two weeks ago and moved swiftly to get a deal done. He was officially appointed as the aforementioned Dutchman's successor on November 1.

**READ MORE:** **[Ruben Amorim appears to confirm United staff as FIVE coaches join him on flight](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-appears-confirm-manchester-30343983)**

Looking ahead to the project that lies ahead of him in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league), Amorim, who led Sporting to five trophies during his time in the Portuguese capital, has admitted that he is "not naive" about the size of the task of trying to turn United's fortunes around.

"I feel ready for the new challenge," Amorim said. "I'm not naive, I know it's going to be very different, very difficult.

"I'm at peace now. I can focus on my new job and I'm looking forward to starting tomorrow (Monday). I know it will be difficult to reproduce what I have here anywhere else but there are other places with different exposure and pressure."

Ruud van Nistelrooy has been holding the fort since Ten Hag's exit on October 28, winning three and drawing one of his four games in interim charge. It is still unclear if the former striker will stay at Old Trafford.

Amorim added: "I have to talk with him tomorrow (Monday). I will explain everything. I'm very clear and I will tell you like it is. So let's wait until tomorrow."

Casemiro is excited about the start of the Ruben Amorim era at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) after hearing positive assessments of the club's new 39-year-old head coach.

Amorim begins work at Carrington on Monday after signing off from Sporting in style. His side recovered from 2-0 down to win 4-2 in a thrilling comeback at Braga, which means he leaves the club top of their domestic league with 11 wins from 11, and on course for a third title in five seasons.

That run of success came after the club had gone 19 years without winning the league. Amorim has restored them to the top of the tree and returned Sporting to being part of Portugal's big three, along with Porto and Benfica. He now faces a similar task at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). United have gone 11 years without a title and given he takes over a team languishing in 13th, that drought will soon hit a dozen years.

But his body of work in Lisbon hints at a coach who knows what it takes to change the fortunes of a club, and that is why Casemiro is looking forward to working under Amorim.

"We have not spoken, but everyone speaks so well of him. Above all he is very true, very loyal," the Brazilian midfielder said.

"We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting. We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he coach that has won a lot.

"I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."

Amorim takes over a squad starting to grow in confidence again after Ruud van Nistelrooy's successful caretaker stint. In his four games in charge, he oversaw three wins and a draw.

Casemiro had spoken to Real Madrid colleagues about the former striker, who spent five years plundering goals at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) before a move to the Bernabeu. He praised the impact Van Nistelrooy made in his two weeks in charge and urged the side to maintain momentum as they prepare for the most hectic spell of the season.

"I honestly enjoyed it a lot. Everyone in Madrid that I had asked before said he was a great person so I was not surprised," the 32-year-old said of Van Nistelrooy.

"From the minute one to spoke to us and told us to always enjoy it, always to be happy always, to take advantage of the moment to play for Manchester. We often forget, don’t we?

"But he was a legend at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc). he was a legend at Madrid. He is a legend of number nines. It was a pleasure. It was a pleasure to share that moment with him. We do not know if he will stay or not, but it was a pleasure to share the dressing room with him.

"Of course we have to keep improving. We have the players to do that. We have to keep growing. We are in a good dynamic. Now comes the international break then the most important part of the season, when there are many matches and when all players are needed.

"We are seeing players injured \[returning\], so that is important. That is important because now, after the break, we have the most difficult stretch of the season."

Ruud van Nistelrooy expects to be told if he will be staying at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) by Monday at the latest.

Van Nistelrooy's interim tenure ended with a 3-0 [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) victory over Leicester City at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) that also ensured the Dutchman's four-game spell ended unbeaten.

Ruben Amorim will officially start as the inaugural United head coach on Monday but it is unclear if the Portuguese will retain Van Nistelrooy, fellow assistant coach Rene Hake and goalkeeping coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar, who all joined the club in the summer.

"I appreciated the clear communication of the club, that it was interim for the short term," Van Nistelrooy said. "It could've been one or two games even, that was the first communication, and they kept me in the loop and said okay, it's gonna be four \[games\].

"For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is this football club, and I'm here to support that in my role.

"And, as I said, I want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

Van Nistelrooy was serenaded by United supporters throughout their first home league win since the first day of the season and the 48-year-old approached the [Stretford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/stretford) End at full-time.

United won three and drew one under Van Nistelrooy, scoring 11 goals and keeping two clean sheets. At full-time against Leicester, United were only four points off fourth place in the table.

Van Nistelrooy said his bonding with the matchgoers at full-time offered 'closure'.

"I can only describe that moment, how I felt, and as a closure of this block of four games, it felt like closure for that period and the future is open, that's the way I felt.

"It was a moment, it was a beautiful moment to be able to share that with the supporters and special.

"I felt like closing this period down, if you say it like that, and basically it was a moment here and now, and that was a beauty of the moment in my opinion, where circumstances came together.

"It was a beautiful moment and it was gratitude from my side to them and the reception I was able to receive was unbelievable. So I can only thank them enough."

Incoming Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim endured an emotional final night as Sporting's head coach as the Portuguese champions overcame a two-goal deficit to win 4-2 away against his former club Braga.

His former captain Ricardo Horta scored two first-half goals to put the hosts ahead at half-time. However, substitute Hidemasa Morita tapped in a rebound at a corner a minute after being brought on by [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) to halve the deficit after the break.

Then, two stunning long-range strikes from captain Morten Hjulmand and teenage forward Conrad Harder, another Amorim substitute, completed the comeback. The latter even scored a second in the fourth minute of added time to ensure Sporting won their seventh straight match to end Amorim's time in charge with an enthralling turnaround.

**READ MORE:****[Roberto De Zerbi's United manager statement could change everything for Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roberto-de-zerbi-man-united-30338721)**

Approaching two dozen players and staff ran over to the departing coach following the full-time whistle, engulfing him in a massive huddle inside the away technical following the fourth goal. Once the full-time whistle blew, Amorim animatedly embraced his players one by one on the pitch before again being surrounded by more than a dozen of them in a huddle as they celebrated.

The defending champions have won their first 11 matches of the league season and all but one of their 17 fixtures across all competitions since losing 4-3 to Porto in the Portuguese Super Cup. The only aberration was a 1-1 draw with PSV in Eindhoven, in which Daniel Braganca scored an 83rd-minute equaliser after the hosts dominated proceedings.

Amorim leaves Lisbon after winning 164 of the 231 fixtures he oversaw for a 71.43% win percentage, losing 33 and drawing 34. During that time, Sporting scored 510 goals—over two per game—and conceded 199—less than one per match—for a +311 goal difference.

Manchester United beat Leicester City 3-0 in Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match in interim charge.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) scored three goals at Old Trafford in the Premier League for the first time since May to take them to within four points of fourth place in the table.

Captain [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) scored on his 250th appearance for the club and Victor Kristiansen put through his own net before half-time. Substitute [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho) rounded off the scoring to ensure Van Nistelrooy's brief reign ended with three wins and a draw.

Here are how the United players rated:

**Andre Onana**

Made an important save in a one-on-one with Wilfred Ndidi at 1-0. That effectively ended any chance of United throwing the game away. 7

**Diogo Dalot**

Van Nistelrooy was on his case a couple of times and his errant positioning let Ndidi on for Leicester's best chance. Hooked early in the second half. 4

**Matthijs de Ligt**

Another solid display after his midweek rest against PAOK. With Leicester devoid of Jamie Vardy, De Ligt had little hassle. 7

**Lisandro Martinez**

His clumsy missed challenge on Jordan Ayew gave Leicester an opening at 0-0. Recovered from an injury to play on. 6

**Noussair Mazraoui**

Back at left back after a midweek shift at right back and his inviting cross resulted in Victor Kristiansen's own goal. 7

**Casemiro**

Some mistimed challenges and sloppiness but he also provided cover and contributed to attacks. Put in a shift before he was forced off. 6

**Manuel Ugarte**

By a distance his most accomplished performance as a Premier League starter, albeit against relegation fodder. A display to build on. 7

**Amad**

Started well, as he did in midweek, before his nifty backheel assisted Bruno Fernandes for the opening goal. The only one of the front three who performed. 7

**Bruno Fernandes**

Lashed in to make it 1-0 on his 250th United appearance and contributed to Kristiansen's own goal. Dabbled in some needless play-acting. 7

**Marcus Rashford**

Recalled at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho and had the benefit of playing on the left but never got anywhere and made way after 57 minutes. 4

**Rasmus Hojlund**

If United had a decent alternative striker then Hojlund would not have started the past three games. Another game where he looked like a boy against men. 4

**Subs**

**Jonny Evans**

Helped United secure a clean sheet. 6

**Alejandro Garnacho**

Great goal. 8

**Joshua Zirkzee**

Decent with the ball. 6

**Christian Eriksen**

Watchable cameo. 6

**Manager**

Picked a logical XI and decisively substituted the underperforming Dalot and Rashford early into the second half. Secured another clean sheet. 8

The penultimate international break of the season inevitably brings plenty of transfer speculation, as the [winter window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/january-transfer-window) is now less than two months away from opening.

[Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim)'s arrival at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) and the results that ended [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag)'s tenure mean much of that interest focuses on [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). The club's leadership team also remains relatively new and has appointed its first head coach since coming together over the summer.

There is never any shortage of transfer rumours when it comes to United, which is the case now more than ever. Here is a round-up of the latest gossip going around.

### Chelsea 'enquiry'

United have reportedly enquired about signing [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) forward Christopher Nkunku. [_L'Equipe_](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Christopher-nkunku-en-salle-d-attente-a-chelsea/1519568) claims the player is unhappy about barely playing in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) this season, with the Blues potentially open to an exit due to the options they have up front.

**_MEN says:_** _Nkunku possibly becoming available on loan would be something United should consider to address their short-term goalscoring issues. However, doing any permanent deal would surely be best avoided unless there is a significant discount on the £52million that brought the France international to Stamford Bridge._

### Sporting star sends Amorim message

Sporting captain Morten Hjulmand acknowledged on Sunday night that the team "wanted to give \[Ruben\] Amorim a victory in his last game." _[O Jogo](https://www.ojogo.pt/8490636264/jogadores-do-sporting-insatisfeitos-com-a-saida-de-ruben-amorim/)_ had previously claimed that he was one of multiple players who questioned their coach's decision to leave midseason.

**_MEN says:_** _Reports about Hjulmand's unhappiness with Amorim appear misplaced judging by these recent comments, which suggest there is still respect for him within the Sporting squad. That bodes well should United return to Lisbon in the summer, if not January, for the likes of Amorim's former captain or centre-forward Viktor Gyokeres, both of whom have been linked with the Reds this year._

Manchester United are being linked with several potential new signings ahead of the January transfer window.

United are set to embark on a new era at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford), with Ruben Amorim officially taking charge as the club's head coach. Amorim leaves Sporting Lisbon after four years as the club's manager and will now be tasked with seeing United challenge for major honours once again.

Sunday saw United claim a 3-0 win over Leicester City in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) in what was Ruud van Nistelrooy's final match as interim manager. The Dutchman oversaw four matches while in interim charge, winning three and drawing one to end his spell unbeaten before Amorim officially takes charge this week.

With the November international break now underway, attention will soon begin to turn to what business United may conduct during the January transfer window. MEN Sport takes a look at some of the latest [United transfer news and gossip](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news) that have generated headlines over the last 24 hours.

**READ MORE:** [**Ruben Amorim's plans for his first day in charge of Manchester United revealed**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorims-plans-first-day-30339898)

**READ MORE: [Ruud van Nistelrooy reveals when Manchester United are set to decide on his future](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-reveals-manchester-30340119)**

United hold an interest in Sporting Lisbon forward Geovany Quenda, as previously reported by _the Manchester Evening News_. Now, according to [Mundo Deportivo](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fichajes/20241110/1002350415/geovany-quenda-lamine-yamal-portugues-pelea-media-premier-league.html), the Reds have taken the initial steps in their efforts to sign the 17-year-old talent.

The report claims that United officials have approached the representatives at Sporting over a potential deal to sign Quenda. However, it has been stated that United will face competition from [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc), Arsenal and [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) for Quenda's signature next year.

Quenda has impressed with Sporting this season in his breakthrough campaign with the Portuguese club. The teenager has two goals and two assists to his name this term and got one assist in the 4-1 victory over City in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league) last week.

Elsewhere, United have been handed a blow in their pursuit of Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite. The Reds made two attempts to sign the centre-back last summer after having two bids rejected by the Toffees for his signature.

According to [Caught Offside](https://www.caughtoffside.com/2024/11/10/exclusive-real-madrid-plot-move-cristian-romero-jarrad-branthwaite/), Real Madrid are weighing up a move to sign Branthwaite in the January transfer window. The report claims that the La Liga giants may decide to enter the transfer market in the New Year to strengthen their defence amid several injury concerns.

It has been claimed that Branthwaite has emerged as a potential target for Madrid, with former Everton boss Ancelotti thought to be putting the defender on the club's radar. The report claims, though, that United are still in the running to sign Branthwaite despite Madrid entering the race for his signature.

André Onana has backed his Manchester United teammates to “step up” and adapt to [Rúben Amorim’s style](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/manchester-united-cannot-play-the-way-sporting-do-warns-ruben-amorim) after watching Sporting [defeat Manchester City 4-1](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/06/ruben-amorim-shuns-the-limelight-on-a-joyful-sporting-swansong) in the Champions League. Amorim, who will arrive in England next week [to replace Erik ten Hag](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/what-took-manchester-united-so-long-to-sack-ten-hag), prefers a 3-4-3 formation and intense pressing, in contrast to United’s 4-2-3-1 under his predecessor.

“I did watch the game yesterday,” Onana said before United’s [Europa League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league) game at home to Paok. “Great victory from them \[Sporting\], by the way. Different system, but the players, my teammates, we are all pragmatic. I think everyone here is capable to play in each system, so I don’t think this will be any issue for us. We have big players, so they will step up.”

[Manchester United fans prefer new stadium to redeveloping Old Trafford Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/manchester-united-fans-new-stadium-redeveloping-old-trafford)

United have drawn their opening three matches in the Europa League, a key contributor to the sacking of Ten Hag, but will be heavy favourites against Paok. The interim head coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has overseen [a victory in the Carabao Cup over Leicester](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-leicester-carabao-cup-match-report) and [a league draw against Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report) but is yet to hold conversations with Amorim, who will take charge of one more Sporting game on Sunday, about the team or his future.

Onana also played under Ten Hag at Ajax and was brought to United in July 2023 but was unable to replicate the success the two had together in the Netherlands. “We didn’t win enough games, it’s so simple,” Onana said. “At a high level, it’s not easy, sometimes you have to pay the price. Unfortunately it was him, but we did everything, players gave everything, we worked hard, we tried our best, but it just didn’t work.”

One player looking to benefit from Amorim’s arrival is Rasmus Højlund. The incoming head coach has got the best out of Viktor Gyökeres, who scored a hat-trick against City, and will hope to do similar with United’s No 9. Van Nistelrooy, asked what Højlund needed to do to reach his potential, said: “Stay calm and believe in himself, believe in his qualities like I do, like his teammates do. He knows he’s young, he’s promising, it’s daily work that he’s putting in that will pay off.”

United have been boosted by the return to training of the long-term absentees Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia but neither is expected to feature in Van Nistelrooy’s final two games.

Rúben Amorim warns 'Manchester United cannot play the way Sporting do' – video
==============================================================================

[Rúben Amorim](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ruben-amorim) said Sporting’s 4-1 rout of Manchester City was a dream way to sign off in his last home game as head coach but warned that when taking over [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) ­he cannot be as 'defensive' as the ­Portuguese champions. 'We cannot transport one reality to another,' he said. 'United cannot play the way we play, they cannot be so defensive. Of course it’s good to beat City. But I’ll be living in a different world, we’ll have to start from a different point'.

Manchester United cannot play the way Sporting do, warns Rúben Amorim
=====================================================================

*   Sporting thrash Manchester City in coach’s home farewell
*   Amorim to take over at Old Trafford on 11 November

[Jamie Jackson](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson) at the Estádio José Alvalade

[Share](mailto:?subject=ManchesterUnitedcannotplaythewaySportingdo,warnsR%C3%BAbenAmorim&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/manchester-united-cannot-play-the-way-sporting-do-warns-ruben-amorim?CMP=share_btn_url)

Rúben Amorim said [Sporting’s 4-1 rout of Manchester City](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/sporting-v-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report) was a dream way to sign off in his last home game as head coach but warned that when taking over Manchester United ­he cannot be as “defensive” as the ­Portuguese champions.

After Phil Foden opened the scoring, Viktor Gyökeres’s hat-trick and a Maximiliano Araújo strike handed City a first [Champions League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague) loss of the season. Yet Amorim was clear the result will mean nothing when he starts at United next week.

“We cannot transport one reality to another,” he said. “United cannot play the way we play, they cannot be so defensive. Of course it’s good to beat City. But I’ll be living in a different world, we’ll have to start from a different point.”

He was asked if this was a dream manner to sign off. “Yes. I couldn’t ask for anything better, it was a very important moment for all. But we had the luck – this was a one off.”

Before the game Amorim quipped that some United fans would view him as the “new Ferguson” if [Sporting](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon) beat their great rivals. “I was playing with words when I said that I am not going to read anything for six months,” said Amorim. “I am going to focus on the team.”

At the end the 39-year-old was given a rapturous reception from the home supporters and the bumps from his players. “I thanked everyone for the win,” he said. “If we hadn’t won the match, the moment wouldn’t be so nice. It was better with a win over City.”

“I wasn’t expecting to be raised in the air, I know what I did for them, and what they did for me. I will keep these memories with me for ever. The most important moment for me was when we lost 5-0 to City \[two years ago\] and everyone applauded.”

Pep Guardiola struck a defiant note. “It’s a difficult moment, but I’m here and want to fight, I like these moments. I don’t want to give up,” City’s manager said. “You cannot say much when you lose 4-1. Emotionally we were not stable enough. Emotionally we have to be more stable.

“It is what it is. Now it is difficult, but I want to fight and not give up. There is a challenge ahead of me.”

Manchester United fans prefer new stadium to redeveloping Old Trafford
======================================================================

*   Survey finds 52% season ticket holders want move
*   Task force recommendations likely next year

A majority of [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) fans favour a new stadium rather than the redevelopment of Old Trafford, a survey has found. Fifty-two per cent of more than 50,000 season-ticket holders, members and executive club members prefer a new ground, ­compared with 31% who support the redevelopment of the existing stadium.

Seventeen per cent were ­undecided on the best option, which is being looked at by the owners in conjunction with the Old ­Trafford regeneration taskforce, which includes Gary Neville, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and the World Athletics president, Lord Coe.

No firm timeframe has been put on taking a decision but it is understood, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph, that it is more likely to be in the spring or summer of next year. There had been indications the decision would be made before the end of this year.

United said on Tuesday that an “options report” would be produced by the taskforce by the end of the year. The taskforce is understood to have centred its discussions on building a 100,000-capacity stadium rather than redeveloping the existing ground. Sources close to the taskforce said in the summer this is about more than building a new stadium and that going ahead with this plan would represent the most ambitious regeneration project in Europe.

United found newer season-ticket holders were most likely to support a new ground, with positive sentiment for it also increasing with age. Rick McGagh, the club’s director of fan engagement, said: “We are delighted that this survey received the most responses in the club’s history. It shows how important this work is.”

In September, it was announced United had appointed Foster + Partners “to develop a masterplan for the Old Trafford Stadium District, covering the club-owned land that surrounds the existing stadium”.

Title: Sporting success of Amorim and Viana soon to be split across Manchester

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/05/sporting-ruben-amorim-hugo-viana-manchester-city-manchester-united

Published Time: 2024-11-05T08:00:14.000Z

Markdown Content:
In Portugal they speak of Hugo Viana working “in the shadows”, a man eager to perform his duties away from the spotlight. He will be especially pleased that his good friend [Rúben Amorim](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ruben-amorim) will take the headlines when Viana’s current and future employers meet in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Over the past six years he has built his reputation as one of Europe’s best young sporting directors by helping to make his first club, Sporting, a force once more.

Sporting had not won the league title for 16 seasons when Viana arrived with only six months’ experience at Belenenses. Under Viana’s direction, [Sporting](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon) have bested both Porto and Benfica twice to finish top – his first title coming in his third season at the club. The former Newcastle midfielder cannot claim all the credit for the turnaround but it was his decision to appoint his former teammate Amorim, paying €10m for a head coach who had started the season managing Braga B in the third tier.

The duo’s success means they will become rivals in Manchester; Viana will soon be tasked [with keeping the City train running](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/11/manchester-city-to-appoint-sporting-lisbon-hugo-viana-as-new-sporting-director) and Amorim with [trying to turn the United ship around](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november) after years of drifting. Working collaboratively is one of the key factors in the two men growing their reputations and whether they can slot into two very different environments and maintain their progression will be fascinating to watch and may even test their bond.

“I think one of the best things that Viana did was to bring the people that he trusts like Amorim,” Viana’s former teammate Hélder Barbosa says. “He’s a young coach and the people start talking a lot about the money they spend but right now everybody talks that he was not a cheap coach but probably he’s the best coach in Portugal right now and he’s young, so they are closer than ever before.”

Viana, however, has not built a career on the back of friendships. He is willing to be ruthless and take risks. He quit Belenenses after falling out with the president and sacked coaches with great regularity in his early days at Sporting in the hope of finding the right formula.

When City were searching for a replacement for [the departing Txiki Begiristain](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/08/guardiolas-future-in-fresh-doubt-with-begiristain-set-to-leave-manchester-city), the research was extensive. There was no chance the club would settle for someone they saw as second best. Quique Cárcel was another prime candidate for the position as director of football but he was left in post at one of City Football Group’s other clubs, Girona.

Barbosa commuted to Braga training with Viana and says: “I never expected that he would continue in football after retiring because we never talk about the players or scouting in the car. We always spoke about football in general but also about business because he had a lot of businesses before. He gave me a lot of advice before on how to spend my money, how to think about the things, because this guy thinks in front of everyone.”

Benfica and Porto were often able to mine talent, especially in South America, bringing in relatively cheap players with potential who required nurturing, alongside academy products. Viana knew he would have to expand the scouting network at Sporting to get them back on a level footing with their bitterest rivals. Over the past summer, Sporting’s four signings arrived from Denmark, Belgium, Mexico and Poland, helping them sit atop the league after 10 consecutive wins. He is regarded as good to deal with, a clear communicator and honest in his assessments in the market, and is helped by a strong relationship with the agent Jorge Mendes.

“Because he was a player, he knows how to speak with the players, the way they think, and it’s better for all of the players if you have someone that played before and he knows what you need,” Barbosa, who won his solitary Portugal cap alongside Viana, says. “He is one step in front of everyone. He was a very good teammate and as a director he has the same good advice and has not changed.”

From Coventry to Toluca, Viana has helped supply Sporting with a conveyor belt of talent to counteract the selling of those who have outgrown Portuguese football. Manuel Ugarte, Pedro Porro and João Palhinha have come and gone under Viana’s watch. All were regarded as investments, none were cheap but there was belief they could grow at Sporting and be sold on to ensure the club is profitable.

“He’s a very quiet guy but I never saw Viana being very nervous about things,” says Barbosa. “Even if he’s nervous, he can be very calm talking.”

Regardless of how good the players are, getting them to perform is not guaranteed and finding and backing the right head coach is imperative. Viana’s bond with Amorim has helped put Sporting back on the map. Amorim is regarded as the most overperforming coach in Europe, working wonders with the comparably limited means.

“Before Viana gets to Sporting, everybody talks about Sporting for bad reasons,” Barbosa says. “All the fans were unhappy, the organisation was not good. Everybody knows what’s happening inside of the dressing room and these kinds of things. In six years, everything changed and Sporting is better than ever.”

There is a cloak around Viana, a man so far away from the limelight it is difficult to shine much on him. He has a very close circle of trust but he will need to adapt to a change of scenery, where his closest ally is set to become an enemy.

Rúben Amorim wary of ‘new Ferguson’ tag if Sporting sink Manchester City
========================================================================

*   New Manchester United manager set for home farewell
*   Amorim says win could lead to ‘difficult’ expectations

[Jamie Jackson](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson) in Lisbon

Mon 4 Nov 2024 12.45 ESTLast modified on Mon 4 Nov 2024 21.31 EST

[Share](mailto:?subject=R%C3%BAbenAmorimwaryof%E2%80%98newFerguson%E2%80%99tagifSportingsinkManchesterCity&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/ruben-amorim-says-win-over-manchester-city-could-make-him-new-alex-ferguson?CMP=share_btn_url)

The incoming [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) manager, Rúben Amorim, has claimed supporters will think he is the “new Sir Alex Ferguson” if his ­current side, Sporting, defeat ­Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday. He said that could make expectations of his role at Old Trafford “difficult”.

City’s visit to the Estádio José Alvalade is Amorim’s last home game as Sporting head coach before [­taking over at United on Monday week](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november). His opening match as Erik ten Hag’s ­successor is on 24 November against Ipswich. His first derby against City will be at the Etihad Stadium on 15 December.

[Ennui is The Thing: welcome to the death-football of late-stage capitalism | Barney Ronay Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/vampirism-meets-overspend-to-make-death-football-of-late-stage-capitalism)

The 39-year-old was asked how he feels about becoming a hero to United ­supporters by securing a win against their local rivals in matchday four of the new Champions League format. He provided a somewhat cautious response. “I don’t think about that,” he said.

“My focus is on winning the match for [Sporting](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon). The conclusions are not important for me because they could be erroneous: if we win tomorrow they will think the new Alex Ferguson has arrived. That will be very difficult. It could increase expectations, I don’t know what is better when I start my new adventure.”

Amorim was asked how taking on City on Tuesday can aid him when facing them in the Premier League. “Tomorrow I will learn a lot during the matches, one thing to watch on TV another is to see it live,” he said. “When I go to Man Utd I will have a different idea, but I don’t know what I will find.”

Amorim spent time at United’s Carrington training base in 2018 as he sought to gain his coaching qualifications and said he was made to feel welcome by José Mourinho, the club’s manager at the time. Asked if he has ­spoken to ­Mourinho about his own ­appointment to the post, Amorim said: “I haven’t yet. He’s full of games \[at Fenerbahçe\] and so am I.

“The impact \[of my visit\] had on my career was the way he treated me. He showed me that you can win everything and be a different ­person than you think. A special coach who opened the door. I will have time to talk to him, he is very ­experienced.

“Regarding my ­experience in ­Manchester, it was the only club where I did an internship, but I never said ‘I want to come back as a coach.’ But \[more\] let’s see what happens.”

City defeated Sporting [5-0 in a Champions League last-16 first leg](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/sporting-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-match-report) two years ago. It was a bruising night for Amorim two years into his reign there but he says he has learned from the experience and moved on. “I feel like a better coach, but \[Pep\] ­Guardiola is also a better coach,” he said.

“The distance \[between us\] remains. We play in different championships, but I feel like I have better players \[than then\]. We are prepared to make a more complete game. Let’s see – tomorrow will be a good game to look at all these nuances.”

With City’s visit being his last in front of Sporting home fans, Amorim said: “I will be able to control my emotions. It is important to win. If so it helps me to leave with more joy. There were many games here, some very remarkable moments, some very difficult. But it will be my last in Alvalade and it will be special.”

Hugo Viana, Sporting’s director of football, will [replace Txiki Begiristain as City’s sporting director](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/11/manchester-city-to-appoint-sporting-lisbon-hugo-viana-as-new-sporting-director) next summer. With Guardiola’s future at the club uncertain, Amorim was asked if this caused him to think he may have been in contention to replace Guardiola at the Premier League champions. “It is something that crosses your mind but I never had any doubt. My decision is made,” he said. “I wanted Man United and that is what I did.”

**United need injection of confidence**
---------------------------------------

If Ruud van Nistelrooy was supposed to wash the nostalgia out of the Manchester United system then perhaps that was achieved, though maybe not as intended. If Rúben Amorim was distracted from preparing Sporting for Manchester City on Tuesday, he will be more aware of a United squad bereft of confidence. United’s [first 60 minutes against Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/vampirism-meets-overspend-to-make-death-football-of-late-stage-capitalism) saw them fumble pathetically for creativity. Not even the presence of one of the club’s greatest strikers has lifted the finishing quality in a group low on goals. Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were both bereft of touch and instinct; substitute Joshua Zirkzee’s signing remains a mystery. There was something of Van Nistelrooy in Rasmus Højlund winning Bruno Fernandes’s penalty, and the goalscorer’s knee slide towards the tunnel at the Stretford End. But there was to be no Ferguson-era ecstatic denouement. This United don’t do them. Van Nistelrooy has two games remaining until United seek the progressive future postponed by mistakenly retaining Erik ten Hag. **John Brewin**

**Caicedo and Lavia boost Chelsea**
-----------------------------------

At Old Trafford, Moisés Caicedo’s thrashing stood out from a performance where [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) allowed victory to slip from their grip. Amid the desperately dull torpor of the first half, with Caicedo and Roméo Lavia in midfield, Chelsea had control but Cole Palmer disappointed, against the club his family supports, as did Enzo Maresca’s other attackers. It was left to Caicedo to motor through midfield in the style that has lately become customary. Transfer values of a combined £220m dictate his partnership with Enzo Fernández needs to work but it is yet to. The Argentinian failed to get the better of even United’s pedestrian midfield after replacing Lavia. With Lavia went Chelsea’s thrust. Maresca has shown himself unafraid to sideline players the ownership wants to work out. He has carefully handled Mykhailo Mudryk’s situation, for example. Lavia, if he can remain clear of injury, suits Chelsea’s midfield far better in allowing Caicedo to be the player they paid top dollar for. **JB**

**Gordon rolls back the years**
-------------------------------

It was the sort of cross prefacing an unstoppable header that Nolberto Solano used to aim at Alan Shearer during Sir Bobby Robson’s Newcastle tenure. Anthony Gordon prefers playing on the left so he can cut inside and shoot on his naturally stronger right side but there is a lot to be side for right-footed right wingers and Gordon excelled in that role as Arsenal’s title hopes were dented. His assist for Alexander Isak’s winner also renewed Newcastle’s relationship with hope at the end of a week when they reached the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and clinched a first [Premier League](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague) victory in six attempts. On a day when Gordon, Isak, Joe Willock, Sean Longstaff and Lewis Hall were strong man of the match contenders, all Eddie Howe lacked was a specialist centre-forward to understudy Isak. Significantly Newcastle’s manager has sent the Swede’s deputy, Callum Wilson, to the pioneering Doha hospital where Erling Haaland and Lionel Messi undergo physical repairs. If Wilson’s back is mended, European qualification may beckon. **Louise Taylor**

**Solanke makes the difference**
--------------------------------

Dominic Solanke’s value to [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur) will be measured by more than goals. The striker can mix it with defenders, link the play and lead his side’s pressing. But for a side with a habit of throwing away points from winnable positions, having a ruthless striker is hardly something to be sniffy about. Spurs, who could once count on Harry Kane settling tight games, will have a better chance of finishing in the top four if Solanke is scoring. He made the difference during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa, notching his side’s second and third goals, and could take satisfaction from outperforming his England teammate Ollie Watkins, who missed a glaring chance in the first half. “The goals are great and as a striker I’m sure he loves the fact he’s got a couple but I can’t speak highly enough about him and what he brings to this team,” Ange Postecoglou said. **Jacob Steinberg**

**Every title contender needs a Gomez**
---------------------------------------

Arne Slot attributed Liverpool’s transformation into a team worthy of leading the Premier League to a change in attitude against Brighton, more than his own tactical switches, and it was Joe Gomez who embodied the fight, quality and character that had been sorely missing from their first-half display. The defender was introduced at the break after Ibrahima Konaté sustained an arm injury when Virgil van Dijk landed on him and was a major factor in extinguishing Brighton’s threat. For a player who was left out of Slot’s first Premier League squad at Ipswich, and whose [Liverpool](https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool) future was in serious doubt in the summer, Gomez’s attitude and professionalism is exemplary. He is what a title contender needs. “I know he came from an interesting summer,” said Van Dijk. “But the way he has been on and off the pitch is remarkable. He’s so respected within the club and the team. He’s a fantastic player and he showed it again. He was outstanding.” **Andy Hunter**

**Clock ticks rapidly for O’Neil**
----------------------------------

Statistics that straddle seasons can often feel pointless – or at least unfair – but it is growing hard to ignore the numbers surrounding Wolves. Gary O’Neil’s side have won one of their past 20 league matches, taking eight points from a possible 60 in that period. Matheus Cunha and João Gomes exhibited moments of brilliance in Saturday’s draw with Crystal Palace to prove it is not all bad but O’Neil, who signed a four-year contract extension in the summer, is running out of time to turn things around. Sections of supporters aired their grievances during the game and failure to beat [Southampton](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southampton) on Saturday will almost certainly spell the end. Regardless, Wolves are in a relegation fight for the long haul. “We’re going to have to scrap all season, we’re going to have to fight, that’s the situation we’re in,” O’Neil said. “We’ve accepted that in the dressing room.” **Ben Fisher**

**Iraola’s hard workers stun champions**
----------------------------------------

No need for panic after Manchester City’s first Premier League defeat of the season, though several concerns. If Bournemouth deserved huge credit, with Antoine Semenyo, Lewis Cook and Milos Kerkez the outstanding players, it was a combination of energy and desire that took apart the champions. Too often, in the press, in the duels and even in the latter stages when City at last exerted some control, it was a Bournemouth player first to the ball. Few would accuse a serial champion squad of lacking desire but in the performances of Ilkay Gündogan, Mateo Kovacic and Kyle Walker, age reared its head. Andoni Iraola fielded Semenyo so Walker would be the winger’s immediate adversary. The Ghanaian so roasted Walker that Pep Guardiola had to shift his raddled captain to centre-back. Kevin De Bruyne on the bench had been a surprise but he did not play. **JB**

**Fabulous Forest into the top three**
--------------------------------------

Ten games in and [Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest) have conceded only seven goals in the league. It is an incredible feat for a team who survived in the Premier League on the final day last season. The two additions to have changed the back four are Nikola Milenkovic and Àlex Moreno. Matz Sels, Ola Aina and Murillo were already impressing under Nuno Espírito Santo but they were given the perfect additions to make Forest robust and balanced at the back. It is an indication that if things are not going well, tweaking is often better than overhauling and Forest are being proven right for their more sensible approach in the market rather than hiring a completely new defence. West Ham had a meagre three shots on Saturday and only one of those was on target as Forest moved into the top three. **Will Unwin**

**Southampton finally shore up defence**
----------------------------------------

Aaron Ramsdale believes Southampton’s performance against Everton showed their togetherness as they picked up a long-awaited first Premier League victory of the season. Ramsdale pulled off several impressive saves before Adam Armstrong’s late winner to outshine England rival Jordan Pickford at the other end but paid tribute to the rest of his defence for their contribution to a first clean sheet of the campaign. “It was a real team effort,” said Ramsdale. “It feels great to get that off our chests, especially the first win. That was more important than the clean sheet but to get both together shows that we are really working for the team. The defenders dealing with Everton’s threat which they’re so good at. If they got through I was thankful I was there and they are the standards I hold myself by. That was the real Aaron Ramsdale the Saints fans saw.” **Ed Aarons**

**Tractor Boys plough on but need win**
---------------------------------------

Ipswich arrived in the brave new world of the Premier League without great expectation, so to have suggested to supporters that their team would avoid defeat in half their opening 10 games would have been an appealing prophecy. Yet five draws and five defeats means the Tractor Boys are one of two teams still without a win and they are letting points slip through their fingers. “It’s 10 games we haven’t won, but five from which we got a result, and probably eight that we competed in,” Kieran McKenna wisely surmised after Leicester snatched a late 1-1 draw at Portman Road, while also voicing some legitimate complaints in the direction of VAR and the referee Tim Robinson. Yet the contrast with fellow new boys Leicester – who are finding ways to grind out important points – is stark.

Title: Ennui is The Thing: welcome to the death-football of late-stage capitalism | Barney Ronay

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/vampirism-meets-overspend-to-make-death-football-of-late-stage-capitalism

Published Time: 2024-11-03T20:42:18.000Z

Markdown Content:
Well, something definitely happened there. But what exactly? There is an affectionate joke about good, punchy Australian sports writing, which basically involves saying _Here’s The Thing, right_, then spelling out exactly what The Thing is in 800 brutally frank words, pounding The Thing into submission, shaking hands with The Thing, then, ideally, going off for a quick drink with The Thing.

What was the thing here? Trapped energy. Drift. Ennui. A good goal by Moisés Caicedo. The death-football of late-stage capitalism. Casemiro lying down a lot, often to surprisingly good defensive effect.

Manchester United and Chelsea did at least produce something recognisable in the course of [this 1-1 draw](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report), specifically a game of two halves, one of them muddled and almost surreally tedious; the other muddled and blessed with a 10-minute spell where things actually happened.

The first half in particular was an extraordinary spectacle simply for its listlessness. It started quite well. Old Trafford always has that Christmassy feeling at kick‑off. Whatever the surrounding weather there is always energy in the ground for the team, and early on there was a familiar sense of will pushing down from the stands. Around here [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) is still a 10‑storey love song.

At which point: nothing happened. It is hard to remember a more meandering half of elite football, the same sense of time being killed pointlessly. Football is a sport made up of dull and forgettable games. Boredom is key part of the sport and an element of its beauty. Even Jorge Valdano’s “shit on a stick” description of English football was kind of a compliment. These people will cheer anything as long as it has energy. For a long time English football berated itself for having energy without craft, too much drive, too much desire.

What was this in that context? Light and heat without content. Football as something empty and frictionless, humans in coloured shirts waiting for life to happen, JG Ballard-ball. At one point there was a three‑minute build-up to a Bruno Fernandes free-kick that was punted into the nearest part of the wall and you felt grateful for the howls and frustration, because, well, it’s just good to feel something.

Cole Palmer flickered at the edges. Caicedo and Roméo Lavia controlled the centre of the pitch. Lavia is a really good midfielder, taking the ball in any space, angling his body always to go forward, fearless in his energy. Although by the end the main function of Chelsea’s competent central pivot was to demonstrate how evident it is Casemiro really has no place at this level. This was like watching a middle-aged man trying to play tennis with someone 20 years younger. At one point Casemiro won the ball with a dramatic full‑body challenge, to huge cheers, but even this was one of these oh-blimey moments, like the ageing fast bowler’s doomed dive at mid-on, the sole purpose of which is not to have to turn and chase the ball to the boundary.

United began to stir in the second half. Wesley Fofana got lost for the opening goal. Robert Sánchez slapped a hand down on Rasmus Højlund’s boot as he eased past. Fernandes buried the penalty. It was nice to see Ruud van Nistelrooy leaping and punching the air in his roll neck and overcoat. Van Nistelrooy has no obvious part in United’s future. The summer move, on a promise of extended Ten Hag time, has been a disaster for his own career path. This was a good moment for him.

Caicedo equalised on 74 minutes, a lovely volleyed finish that was only improved by the sight of Enzo Maresca, still furious about his team going behind, weirdly half-celebrating on the touchline with a face that still suggested someone had just pranged his Skoda Superb at a mini‑roundabout.

And that was pretty much that, barring some static towards the end, noise and fury without edge. The final score seemed fitting. A point takes Chelsea back into fourth spot. On the other hand they might also expect to beat the 13th best team in the country.

The keynote will remain the basic oddity of the occasion. This was in outline a meeting of two forms of US ownership, successful vampirism versus a mania of unsustainable overspend. Chelsea’s 11 featured nine players signed in the current age of wow‑ball for a combined half a billion or so. United’s was the usual collection of random footballers, half‑thought ideas, fill-ins, hook-ups, Mr Wrongs.

What will happen now to these carry-overs, all those big contract players that seem to have been at the club for decades, handed down from regime to regime like a cracked china tea service? Little wonder this team has no pattern. Here United had a player on the bench just called “Amass”. Next week: an idea. A thought. A seat.

For now the wheels keep turning, the content machine continues to churn. What is being sold here exactly? A middling team in red shirts. Brand recognition, aura, free‑floating energy. A point from a draw is at least a gift to the new manager as United wait in standby mode for the next leap forward; a club that have never been quite so obviously in need of A Thing.

‘I feel responsible’: Fernandes apologises to Ten Hag over sacking
==================================================================

*   ‘It is easier to get rid of a manager than 15 players’
*   Midfielder scored from spot in 1-1 draw with Chelsea

[Jamie Jackson](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiejackson) at Old Trafford

Sun 3 Nov 2024 15.32 ESTLast modified on Sun 3 Nov 2024 21.31 EST

[Share](mailto:?subject=%E2%80%98Ifeelresponsible%E2%80%99:FernandesapologisestoTenHagoversacking&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/i-feel-responsible-fernandes-apologies-to-ten-hag-over-united-sacking?CMP=share_btn_url)

Bruno Fernandes has revealed he apologised to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.theguardian.com/football/erik-ten-hag) for any part he may have played in the Dutchman’s sacking.

Speaking on Sunday after [Manchester United’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report) at Old Trafford, the club captain said: “It is easier to get rid of a manager than 15 players. I spoke to the manager and apologised to him. I was disappointed he has gone and I tried to help him. I wasn’t scoring goals, we are not scoring goals and I feel responsible.”

[Moisés Caicedo’s stunner secures draw for Chelsea at Manchester United Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report)

Fernandes scored United’s opener from the penalty spot against Chelsea in the 70th minute, Moisés Caicedo’s volley equalising four minutes later. This was United’s first league game since [Ten Hag’s removal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/what-took-manchester-united-so-long-to-sack-ten-hag) and Fernandes’s penalty his first league goal this season.

“We know that Erik has gone, it is not good for anyone at the club when the manager goes,” Fernandes said. “The team is not the best, the results are not the best and he is the one who pays for it. Whenever you see a manager go you have to take some of the blame on yourself, it is because the team is not doing so well.”

Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ten Hag’s replacement as interim manager, was asked about Fernandes’s apology. “It has been very difficult from last Monday to today: six days, a rollercoaster of emotions,” he said.

“I was very sad seeing Erik leave. The next day you have to start to focus on getting the lads ready for Leicester \[in the Carabao Cup last Wednesday\] because 75,000 people show up here at Old Trafford and the players feel they have an obligation to do better. They look in the mirror and their reactions then and today show they think about things.”

In the 93rd minute of the draw on Sunday, Lisandro Martínez caught Cole Palmer’s knee with a high foot. While the [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) playmaker continued, he required ice on the injury in the dressing room afterwards. Rob Jones showed the defender a yellow card and the video assistant referee supported the initial decision. At the final whistle Chelsea’s head coach, Enzo Maresca, asked the official to explain his ruling.

“No,” Maresca said. “They didn’t say anything. When there is no intention to go for the ball, and go for legs I think it is quite clear it is a red. He \[Palmer\] was in the changing room with ice so we are waiting now, hopefully it is nothing important. It is quite clear almost for all of us but the referee took a different decision. When there is not intention to go for the ball and you just go for the player, it is red.”

Regarding the incident the Premier League Match Centre on X said: “The referee issued a yellow card to Martínez for a challenge on Palmer. VAR checked for a potential red card and confirmed the referee’s call of no red card, deeming that it was a reckless challenge and not serious foul play.”

“I’m excited for it because it’s new, but then you’re always excited for a new manager, aren’t you?” says Siobhan, grinning. She and her sister Shauna are heading to their perches in Old Trafford’s North Stand with a spring in their steps. A sort of not‑quite‑but-soon new head coach bounce, if you will.

With the [ink now dry on Rúben Amorim’s contract](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november), thoughts, imaginations even, of Manchester United supporters are future-facing. A future, everyone hopes, that will be significantly brighter than the present.

Amorim’s delayed start date – he arrives on 11 November – meant [the 1-1 error-riddled draw with Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report) on Sunday lacked Portuguese flags and T-shirts paying homage to their new head coach. There was not even a witty ditty or two from the Stretford End.

All of that will come soon. Still, it was impossible not to sense the anticipation of a fresh start, a new school year, as supporters arrived.

Nearly a week has now passed since [Erik ten Hag received his P45](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/oct/28/erik-ten-hag-sacked-by-manchester-united-news-and-reaction-live). But even with that time to gather considered thoughts, finding a three-pronged plug socket on mainland Europe would be easier than locating anyone in Manchester’s red half willing to argue the Dutchman’s stint of two and a bit seasons should have run on further.

“Whatever else is going on in the club, whatever other problems we’ve got, with our squad 14th in the league after quarter of a season isn’t good enough,” Jack, a lifelong season‑ticket holder, says. “The decision was inevitable but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t disappointing.”

Arun says: “I still don’t understand what Ten Hag was trying to achieve. It’s been miserable coming here – no goals and a lot of losses.”

“When Erik first came in, we liked him,” Shauna says softly. “We still like him, and I don’t think he’s been treated very well. But it looked as though the players had downed tools.” She and her sibling insist the Old Trafford atmosphere under Ten Hag lacked the toxicity present during the later stages of the [David Moyes](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacked-manchester-united#:~:text=The%20move%2C%20revealed%20in%20The,handed%20a%20six%2Dyear%20contract.) and [Louis van Gaal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-sack) eras, with Siobhan telling the Guardian that there was “frustration, rather than dislike – all the patience had run out”.

Bobby, another season-ticket holder, says: “I’d give his reign a B- or a C+. There were some unbelievable moments, but there were big losses, concerns around recruitment and continual fitness issues for key players – I don’t remember the last time I saw Luke Shaw play.

“I have some sympathy with [Jim Ratcliffe’s team](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/20/sir-jim-ratcliffe-manchester-united-buy-in-official-sign-off#:~:text=Sir%20Jim%20Ratcliffe's%2027.7%25%20buy,the%20Glazers%2C%20the%20majority%20shareholders.). Ideally, they’d have replaced him after [the FA Cup final win](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/25/manchester-city-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report), but it would have been a very unpopular move and would have heaped a lot of pressure on any new manager.”

Last Wednesday night, a [Carabao Cup thrashing of Leicester](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-leicester-carabao-cup-match-report#:~:text=Fernandes%20double%20fires%20Manchester%20United%20to%20Carabao%20Cup%20rout%20of%20Leicester,-Jamie%20Jackson%20at&amp;text=Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy%20may%20never,warm%20him%20in%20his%20dotage.) under United’s interim leader, Ruud van Nistelrooy, lifted the club’s mood. “Maybe it was relief,” Siobhan says. “But there was a bounce physically when you saw the players come out.”

There was a visible buoyancy to Van Nistelrooy on Sunday, too, as he dashed around his technical area dressed as the school’s trendy humanities teacher. He is desperate to stay on in some capacity but is equally desperate to enjoy what is in effect a three‑game testimonial.

In a week’s time, though, Van Nistelrooy will hand over a sizable task to Amorim. A decade of overpayment and underperformance, of misinformed mis-step after mis‑step, will require some undoing.

For Arun, the key is that Amorim carves out “some sort of identity, a philosophy that he sticks to”, saying: “This season, for me, is a bit of a write-off already. I don’t mind where we finish if we get that identity.”

Bobby, who sees positives in the way United and Sporting have negotiated the terms of Amorim’s job swap, says: “I suspect he’s got a lot of problems to solve, and a lot of fires to fight from day one. The way it’s been handled sensibly shows an element of forethought, which perhaps other appointments haven’t had. That gives me some confidence and hope.

“Over the coming months we’ll be dipping back into the Sporting coaching staff and the team to bolster the squad. So keeping relationships cordial and Amorim happy are important.”

Amorim, for whatever words are worth in football, has said he will not return to Lisbon for a spot of January poaching, although it is no secret that a gaggle of his backroom staff are expected to join him in Manchester.

The king is … well, he never quite obtained royal status, did he? Long live the king. When he arrives.

Title: Moisés Caicedo’s stunner secures draw for Chelsea at Manchester United

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/03/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report

Markdown Content:
It has come to feel like a collector’s item – a [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) goal in the Premier League. When it came, Bruno Fernandes scoring from the penalty spot on 70 minutes, the celebrations were suitably wild. Especially from Ruud van Nistelrooy, the United interim manager who is keeping the dugout warm for Rúben Amorim.

Van Nistelrooy pumped his fists, he ran down the line, he jumped up and he punched the air. It was like the old days when he led the United line, and the release of emotion was understandable because there had been plenty of frustration about the team’s performance.

It was only their ninth goal of the league campaign – in their 10th game; remarkable levels of profligacy have been a major theme, one of the many drivers in the demise of Erik ten Hag.

The lead lasted only four minutes. [Chelsea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea) deserved something, especially on the back of their first-half display, and they got it when the game’s best player, Moisés Caicedo, caught a dropping ball so sweetly on the edge of the area after a half-cleared corner. It was a celebration of technique and concentration, the volley fizzing through a crowd and into the bottom corner, André Onana powerless.

There were chances at both ends thereafter, Fernandes blowing a gilt‑edged opportunity in stoppage time but the draw was about right. It left United on 12 points, their lowest tally after 10 league fixtures since 1986‑87, the season when Alex Ferguson took charge on 6 November (after 13 games). It is fair to say that Amorim will start from a low base.

Van Nistelrooy has two more games in charge – PAOK in the Europa League on Thursday, Leicester on Sunday, both at home – and this one was always going to be tougher than the Carabao Cup romp against Leicester last week. Chelsea had travelled with confidence, Enzo Maresca reverting to his first-choice XI after rotating all of them in the Carabao Cup exit at Newcastle. The team were set up for Cole Palmer and he was prominent, as usual.

![Image 1: Bruno Fernandes scores for Manchester United against Chelsea from the penalty spot.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba572affc9d1b1975b5b1b5a1a8108c4292ea21/0_124_3212_1927/master/3212.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

There was a reason why Palmer sought space up the inside left; to get at Casemiro, to exploit the United midfielder’s lack of mobility. It was from a loose Casemiro pass that Palmer almost profited early on, Caicedo stepping up to win the ball and feed him. Palmer was kept out by a solid piece of one-on-one defending by Matthijs de Ligt.

Chelsea were the better team in the first half, more cohesive up through the thirds, Caicedo excellent. Their big chance was Noni Madueke’s header from a Palmer corner on 15 minutes. With Wesley Fofana also free behind him, Madueke adjusted his body to head against the post. Was Fofana better placed? On the rebound, Lisandro Martínez swiped at Levi Colwill. Chelsea wanted a penalty. It would have been generous.

Chelsea’s press created a few problems for United, especially when Onana played Casemiro into trouble, Caicedo making the challenge and watching the ball loop up and over the crossbar. Chelsea’s general menace, though, did not translate into many clear chances.

United wanted to win the ball and transition quickly, looking for Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. There were too many times when they either missed their passes or did not move the ball quickly enough. It was a slog; plenty of effort, low levels of composure and quality.

United did have chances in the first half, two big ones, the first in the 24th minute when Rasmus Højlund crossed low on the counter and Rashford let it run for Garnacho. He stepped inside only to shoot tamely. On the stroke of half-time Fernandes crossed for Rashford, who banged a volley off the top of the crossbar from a difficult angle.

Pedro Neto ran at Diogo Dalot after the interval and drilled low past the far post but it was increasingly error strewn and attritional. When Garnacho blew a golden chance from a Fernandes cutback, scuffing the shot with his right foot, it was easy to wonder where the goal would come from. For Garnacho, it was one of those days.

Højlund battled gamely with Fofana and Colwill and finally he gave the former the slip, getting in behind him to control a Casemiro cross. If the touch took him away from goal, he got his reward when Robert Sánchez flew off his line to catch his ankle with his gloves. Fernandes’s penalty was nerveless.

Game over? Not a chance. With this United team, the closing stages are normally the prompt for the chaos. Once they were level, Chelsea almost scored again, the ball reaching Enzo Fernández, on as a substitute, after a ricochet and a De Ligt slip. With Onana off his line, Fernández’s chip sailed high.

Back came United. Garnacho shot past the far post and faded a side-on volley too high. In between times Joshua Zirkzee, on as a substitute, was too slow to get in on goal after a Fernandes flick.

Fernandes almost had the final word, enjoying the break of the ball inside the area only to volley over. Martínez was fortunate to see yellow rather than red at the very end after raking his studs down Palmer’s knee; he set out to stop him and wanted to make absolutely sure. With United, there are precious few certainties at present.

Ruud van Nistelrooy ready for criticism from ex-Manchester United teammates
===========================================================================

*   ‘They want the club to do well and have their opinions’
*   Interim manager backs Joshua Zirkzee after difficult start

[Dominic Booth](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dominic-booth)

Sat 2 Nov 2024 18.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 2 Nov 2024 18.52 EDT

[Share](mailto:?subject=RuudvanNistelrooyreadyforcriticismfromex-ManchesterUnitedteammates&body=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/ruud-van-nistelrooy-ready-for-criticism-from-ex-manchester-united-teammates?CMP=share_btn_url)

Ruud van Nistelrooy is not expecting an easy ride from his former [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) teammates in the media during his spell as interim manager.

The voices of former players such as Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand, members of the all-conquering Sir Alex Ferguson side that also featured Van Nistelrooy, have become prominent in the discussion around United in recent years.

With the Dutchman in situ as United’s interim manager [for three more games](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/ruud-van-nistelrooy-manchester-united-future) until the November international break – when Rúben Amorim is set to take permanent charge – he is braced for whatever the critics throw at him.

“We all do our jobs don’t we and basically they care for the club,” Van Nistelrooy said when asked whether his former colleagues’ criticism would be an issue. “They want the club to do well, and they are disappointed when it doesn’t go well, and they have opinions on that.

“I don’t take it personally. When I see them and have a cup of coffee with them I have no problems. I appreciate them as former colleagues and some of them I’m still in touch with. That’s the path some of them choose and others stay more on the football side, so for me it is absolutely fine.”

Van Nistelrooy oversaw [a free-scoring 5-2 win over Leicester](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-leicester-carabao-cup-match-report) in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday in his first game after Erik ten Hag’s sacking. A sterner test of his credentials awaits on Sunday as in-form Chelsea visit Old Trafford.

“In the end you are going to be judged,” he said. “I think \[against Leicester\] the reaction was good and everybody was positive. In football things can change or it can continue, but I don’t believe the hype or the drama that much, I know it’s the world we live in. For me it’s important to stay calm, do my job on a daily basis and I think that also has to be the case for this club. We are not going to turn it around from today to tomorrow. But I believe we’re going to get it done over the long-term future.”

Van Nistelrooy also believes Joshua Zirkzee will rise above the critics and become a key man for United. Zirkzee, signed for €42.5m (£35.8m) from Bologna in the summer, scored on his debut but has failed to find the net in 13 subsequent appearances and has taken flak from fans.

“He’s a young player with a lot of potential,” Van Nistelrooy said of his countryman. “He’s a typical No 9 in the sense that \[his\] hold-up play is very good, he’s good in the combination play. He’s a different type to Rasmus \[Højlund\], who’s getting behind defenders. Josh is more one who’s coming towards the ball and gets the team playing. He’s one with a lot of talent, a good age and a lot of potential to develop. One we need to look after, give him time and he will get better and better and be a very big player for this club.”

Title: Rúben Amorim has the Ferguson aura but will the United job eat the rising star? | Jonathan Wilson

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/nov/02/ruben-amorim-has-the-ferguson-aura-but-will-the-united-job-eat-the-rising-star

Published Time: 2024-11-02T20:00:23.000Z

Markdown Content:
Forget the details, forget the noise. Forget the specifics. Imagine you run a big club on a losing streak. You are looking to appoint a new manager. What do you want, ideally? You want a young manager on the way up, someone fresh, with vision and drive and personality. Someone who could perhaps still be leading the club a decade later.

At the very highest level, most managerial careers are relatively short. The notion of a “proven winner” is a consoling but meaningless shorthand. There is no such thing; everything is fluid, everything is contingent; there is always a context; every career has an arc.

There are exceptions, most notably [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson), but few managers last more than a decade at the absolute peak. Management is hard. Football evolves constantly. For a head coach to keep developing occasionally at the cost of what has worked in the past, to stay ahead of the game, is brutally tough and requires not only insight but spectacular will and self-belief.

Everyone tends, ultimately, to self-parody. It happened to Brian Clough, it happened to Arsène Wenger and it is happening to José Mourinho, as they reached not for the best solution to a problem but for the most characteristic solution. It is enormously to Jürgen Klopp’s credit that in his ninth season at Liverpool, after seven at Borussia Dortmund, he recognised that [fatigue was gnawing at him and left](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/19/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manager-farewell-anfield). And Klopp was somebody of unusual energy.

So ideally you want a manager on the way up, about to blossom, with a full decade of greatness ahead. Identifying that figure is hard. Almost by definition they will not yet have achieved great things. Chelsea’s appointment of Mourinho in 2004 was a rare case of the bright young thing being obvious, having just won the Uefa Cup and the Champions League with Porto. But when they tried to repeat the trick seven years later with André Villas-Boas, after he too had won the Europa League (as the Uefa Cup had become) with Porto, it failed. There are no certainties.

![Image 1: Alex Ferguson talks to Aberdeen players at the 1983 Scottish Cup final](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6373a57af98f3befe12e339533aaf473770db63d/55_168_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

It’s a sign of the lack of football knowledge at a decision-making level at [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) over the past 11 years that, until Erik ten Hag, they never tried to identify the rising star of world management. David Moyes was appointed seemingly because he bore a superficial similarity to Ferguson in being Glaswegian; in retrospect it seems mystifying that anyone thought the football with which he had sustained Everton would meet the demands of Old Trafford. Louis van Gaal was experienced and enjoying a pragmatic second flowering, but had turned 63 soon after taking the job; he was never a long-term appointment.

Mourinho in 2013 might have worked but by the time he took over in 2016 he had been through his toxic exits from Real Madrid and Chelsea, second time around. There were plenty of warning signs he was past his peak and [the toxicity he naturally brought](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/17/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-defensive-dogma) – which is why Sir Bobby Charlton vetoed an approach when Ferguson left – would not be offset by silverware.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær was a necessary short-term antidote to that, a cheery club legend whose obvious happiness to be there immediately dispelled much of the gloom, but his appointment on a permanent deal was evidence of a board swept along by public opinion, unable to undertake strategic planning. [Ralf Rangnick’s bizarre interim status](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/fred-says-rangnicks-interim-status-a-little-bit-bad-for-manchester-united) undermined him before he had begun.

Ten Hag seemed a coach of great potential. He had won the Eredivisie three times with Ajax and, after thrillingly beating Real Madrid and Juventus, had taken them to within about [30 seconds of the Champions League final](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/ajax-tottenham-champions-league-semi-final-match-report-moura). Not all promise is delivered upon – and he was 13 years older when he took the job than [the incoming Rúben](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break) **[](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break)**[Amorim](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/31/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-head-coach-start-international-break) is now.

In Amorim, United finally have one of the thrusting pups of European management, somebody who drew interest from both Liverpool and Manchester City. Not only that, but there is an obvious similarity to Ferguson in that in a league that is essentially a duopoly, he took a third force to the title.

![Image 2: Erik ten Hag ](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a524cb5ff7cd7752bcd543d02ee4daee22447a/27_56_5401_3241/master/5401.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

Erik ten Hag showed at United that just because a coach has the desirable managerial profile does not mean he will be a success. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images

Sporting are much closer to Benfica and Porto than Aberdeen were to Celtic and Rangers, and Ferguson had brought an almost unimaginable European success at Pittodrie as well. Ferguson was five years older when he took the United job than Amorim is now, but he too was a rising talent, who had succeeded with outsiders, ready for his chance in a wealthier, more glamorous league.

As Ten Hag’s example demonstrates, just because a coach has something approaching the desirable profile does not mean he will be a success. Perhaps more troubling for United, though, is the context that surrounds them, the size of the club, the depth of expectation, the incoherence of the squad.

After early defeats by Brighton and Brentford, Ten Hag’s first season seemed to have gone pretty well. Limitations of personnel forced him to amend his approach – as Amorim will have to change his too – and he did it well enough to get United to third in the Premier League albeit off the back of an exceptional season from Bruno Fernandes and a great and, as it turned out, unsustainable start from Casemiro.

'The soap opera is ending': Rúben Amorim on Manchester United move – video

He resolved the Cristiano Ronaldo problem with admirable clear-sightedness and, while United were far from spectacular, it didn’t seem unreasonable to think that his second season, with more of his own players, would bring further progress. It did not – and the players he brought in were ultimately what did for him. By the end the steely-eyed figure of that first season had become a risible character, who claimed that conceding 25 chances per game wasn’t a concern and gibbered about the fluidity of Matthijs de Ligt’s blood.

In his fall lies a deeper fear. What if this is just what United do to managers? What if that is why only three coaches have ever won the title with United despite them being the most successful side in English league history, as though the club is a vast and truculent dragon who will submit to being ridden by only a tiny chosen few? What if there is simply something about the United job that is just too big, too difficult, too chaotic? Stare into it long enough, and the United job stares back into you.

'I was told it was now or never': Rúben Amorim on Manchester United move – video
================================================================================

Rúben Amorim spoke to journalists before his move to Manchester United to replace Erik ten Hag. Amorim said he initially wanted to move to Old Trafford from Sporting at the end of the season but United told him it wasn't possible. He said: 'It's not the first time that I have had the clause paid by a club and it's not the second time and it reached the fifth year and I had to make a choice.'

Title: Rúben Amorim faces challenge to end Manchester United’s culture of instability

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/02/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-culture-of-instability

Published Time: 2024-11-02T12:30:14.000Z

Markdown Content:
At two and a half years, Rúben Amorim’s contract as Manchester United’s manager is no resounding this-is-our-man-for-the-long-term deal from Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s football department.

It may be a sagacious move by those charged with executing the best move for the club. In versing themselves in the 20-times record champions’ recent history, Dan Ashworth, the sporting director, and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, will have noted how, since Sir Alex Ferguson departed in May 2013, none of his five permanent successors [have lasted three years](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/what-took-manchester-united-so-long-to-sack-ten-hag).

This points to the quicksand beneath the Old Trafford hot seat that has sucked down David Moyes (tenure: June 2013-April 2014), Louis van Gaal (June 2014-May 2016), José Mourinho (May 2016-December 2018), Ole Gunnar Solskjær (March 2019-November 2021) and Erik ten Hag (May 2022-October 2024).

What we see, too, is how the mantra repeated by the club that all would be given time to right the listing ship evaporated once the maelstrom of poor results hit.

In one of Ten Hag’s last media conferences the point was put by this correspondent that no manager had been in place for three years and that since Ratcliffe et al recognise patience was needed, the Dutchman might need five.

Ten Hag said: “There’s almost no club in the world where expectations are so high and that’s set from the era of Sir Alex and the rest of us have to deal with this. Demands \[are\] the highest in every process and we’re not there in every process. We so far haven’t got to challenge for the Premier League or Champions League but that’s the ambition.”

Run through every post-Ferguson failure and the same stew of managerial missteps, abysmal recruitment, losing fans’ faith and pressure from inside/outside is found.

![Image 1: The former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal greets José Mourinho, the manager at the time, before United’s match against Liverpool at Anfield in October 2017.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f06b1898cc2e63e20b4bcc72b3b91624d9781ba/0_147_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

Moyes went after 34 Premier League matches and was culled when United could no longer seal a Champions League berth – a function of internal pressure. The Scot’s major signings were Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata – here, the dodgy recruitment. Moyes’s billing of Liverpool as “favourites” when visiting Old Trafford in March 2014 lost supporters, and came a month after the 2-0 Champions League loss at Olympiakos: [a “nadir” for this writer](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/25/olympiakos-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report) and the starting gun that set running the external scrutiny.

[Van Gaal was sacked](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-sack) the day after claiming the 2016 FA Cup – the first post-Ferguson trophy – because of Champions League qualification failure. “Average” is a fair characterisation of the transfers he was granted, a group who included Ángel Di María, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Daley Blind. Sideways, “anti-United” football wiped away fan backing and caused pundits and the media to question him.

Mourinho was removed 48 hours after the dire 3-1 loss at Liverpool in December 2018 amid a turf war ignited by the club’s refusal to purchase Harry Maguire that summer. And, his [“respect, respect, respect”](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/22/respect-covering-jose-mourinho-manchester-united-wild-ride) outburst to a question from this correspondent after a 3-0 home reverse to Tottenham four months before his removal was the moment the fans lost faith and seasoned United watchers started to wonder at the “Special One’s” longevity.

Solskjær’s big misstep was [failing to beat Villarreal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/26/villarreal-manchester-united-europa-league-final-2021-match-report) in the 2021 Europa League final: had he done this and broken his silverware drought, he might have survived the following season’s flatlining results which led to his axing in November. The Norwegian’s boom-and-bust time in charge caused near-constant speculation that the end was soon nigh. Transfer-wise, he was handed the fait accompli signing of an ageing Cristiano Ronaldo in summer 2021. And from the following mid-October, fans could not stomach the 4-2 defeat at Leicester, consecutive home humiliations by [Liverpool (5-0)](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/24/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report) and Manchester City (2-0) and the 4-1 trouncing at Watford, which finally caused the trigger to be pulled.

'The soap opera is ending': Rúben Amorim on Manchester United move – video

So, after the sorry tales of these proud managers, we arrive at Amorim, who in Friday’s press release was revealed as United’s first “head coach”. This is a function of Ratcliffe’s new structure, indicates that the all-powerful manager is viewed as an anachronism and, maybe, recognises that Amorim could be chewed up before the 12-month extension on his terms can be taken.

After all, Amorim is predated by 10 appointments in the 11 post-Ferguson years, once the quintet of interim managers is included: Ryan Giggs (April-May 2014), Solskjær (December 2018-March 2019), Michael Carrick (November 2021), Ralf Rangnick (November 2021-May 2022) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (October-November 2024). Instability has become United’s unwanted culture. Those picking the XI are here today and gone far too soon.

In April Amorim dallied with West Ham but a wage demand of about €10m is thought to have put off David Sullivan, the club’s largest shareholder. Ratcliffe has granted Amorim the salary, which represents an approximate threefold increase on his €3m (after tax) pay at [Sporting](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon). He hopes to start deserving it when taking his side to Ipswich on 24 November for United’s first game under him.

Amorim suggested that on Friday, after Sporting play Estrela, the “soap opera” of his move would be over. Maybe. But, soon, life under the United microscope begins. Recently this has been a saga featuring far too many embarrassing displays and ongoing high farce. To succeed and last for three years, at least, Amorim has to move the club on.

Title: Manchester United hail Rúben Amorim, who admits he tried to delay joining club

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november

Published Time: 2024-11-01T23:55:01.000Z

Markdown Content:
Manchester United hailed Rúben Amorim as one of Europe’s “most exciting and highly rated young coaches” after appointing him on a contract to 2027.

The 39-year-old revealed last night that he originally wanted to take over at Old Trafford at the end of the season, but will instead start as Erik ten Hag’s successor on 11 November after working out a notice period at [Sporting](https://www.theguardian.com/football/sporting-lisbon).

Speaking after the Portuguese side’s 5-1 win over Estrela, Amorim explained that he had already decided to leave Lisbon at the end of the season and had told the Sporting president. “Then this situation with Manchester United came up,” he said. “They paid the clause, they paid above the clause, and the chairman defended their interests.

“Then the negotiations came to me. I asked for it to be at the end of the season, I spent three days asking for it, and they told me it was impossible. That it was now or never. I had three days to make a decision that would radically change my life. That’s what I did.”

He added: “I knew that if I rejected it I wouldn’t have it in six months. And I knew that in six months I wouldn’t be at Sporting. The only club I want \[were United\] and that moved me.”

In their announcement earlier in the day, United described Amorim as their head coach, making him the first leader of the men’s team not referred to as the manager. That appeared to be a nod towards the structure put in place by Ineos since it took charge of football operations. Amorim is understood to be the only coach spoken to by United in this process.

The former Portugal midfielder was [United’s favoured candidate](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/manchester-united-sack-erik-ten-hag) after Ten Hag was sacked with the club 14th in the Premier League. Sporting announced on Tuesday that United had approached them and [expressed a willingness to pay](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/29/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-sporting-replacement) the €10m (£8.3m) release clause but the move was [held up by negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-sporting-30-day-notice-period) regarding his 30-day notice period.

A compromise, that involved United paying an extra €1m, was agreed for Amorim to continue at Sporting until after their game at Braga on 10 November.

Amorim claimed last night that he had turned down past offers, but the United job was the one for him. “It’s not the first time, nor the second, that I’ve had the clause paid,” he said. “I don’t want another club. After Sporting, I wanted that club \[United\].”

Amorim is United’s sixth permanent appointment since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013 and none of the previous five remained in position for three full seasons.

His contract runs for two full seasons after this one and the club have an option to extend it by a year. “Rúben is one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football,” United said.

“Highly decorated as both a player and coach, his titles include winning the Primeira Liga twice in Portugal with Sporting CP, the first of which was the club’s first title in 19 years. Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until Rúben joins.”

Amorim is expected to bring five backroom staff with him from Lisbon: the coaches Emanuel Ferro, Adélio Cândido and Carlos Fernandes, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and sports scientist Paulo Barreira. Amorim confirmed yesterday: “I’m going to take my staff. It was always one of the conditions.”

Amorim, who also won two league cups in four full seasons at Sporting, had been [on Manchester City’s radar](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/15/manchester-city-target-ruben-amorim-as-next-manager-if-pep-guardiola-leaves) as they plan for Pep Guardiola’s possible departure and a home Champions League game against City on Tuesday is among his final Sporting matches.

After the confirmation of his successor’s appointment, Ten Hag released a farewell letter to United supporters last night. “Dear fans, let me start by thanking you,” he said in the statement. “Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you. I felt it many times. Also in away games, it gave the team and me an incredible feeling to hear the United chants taking over the opponents’ stadiums.”

His letter added: “We won two trophies – achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, that dream has come to an end. I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory.

“Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.”

Ten Hag was fired after Sunday’s controversial [2-1 defeat at West Ham](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report), which left United with just three wins and 11 points after nine matches.

The interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy oversaw a [5-2 Carabao Cup win against Leicester](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/manchester-united-leicester-carabao-cup-match-report) on Wednesday and is now preparing to lead the side in Sunday’s league game against Chelsea.

The Dutchman, formerly assistant to Ten Hag, will also take charge against Paok in the Europa League and Leicester again in the Premier League before handing the reins to Amorim.

Amorim’s appointment was welcomed by the club’s Portuguese defender Diogo Dalot. “He is a fantastic coach and knows what he wants,” Dalot told Sky Sports. “Very demanding is what I can expect. It’s a perfect match for a club like this. The Premier League suits people from Portugal. We have a culture of constantly trying to improve ourselves as we come from a small country. I really hope that it is one more case. I am really excited to start working with him.”

Title: Amorim is the right choice at last: now Manchester United must make it work | Barney Ronay

URL Source: http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-analysis-optics

Markdown Content:
Live, die, repeat. There is a familiar feeling of pathos in watching [the latest Manchester United manager](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november) loom into view, carpetbag in hand, squaring those fragile shoulders, another face, another four-year plan, all these brave hopeful souls, like men in hats and coats heading off to Flanders.

It should be said United have been impressively efficient in reaching this point. Unsticking a premium European manager from a Champions League club in mid-season is no simple task. The announcement of Rúben Amorim as head-coach-in-waiting comes four days on from the [sacking of Erik ten Hag](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/manchester-united-sack-erik-ten-hag). After the Weekend at Bernie’s absurdity of Ten Hag’s new contract, after the four-month zombie-stumble into the current season that has made Amorim’s own task so much harder, this has at least been surgical and decisive.

At which point it is tempting to see the start of another whodunnit. We know this story by now. We know it ends with a body. We know the optics, the chalk lines, the world-weary forensics team, the detective inspector in the rumpled overcoat. The key point of interest at this early stage is always the same. Exactly how, in what highly personalised way, are [Manchester United](https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united) going to do for this poor soul?

The pattern in the post-Ferguson era has been to tease out one particular quality, to reduce the incumbent to an exaggerated cartoon. It took four months for David Moyes to be recast as a boggle-eyed impostor, the salesman with an empty suitcase. By the end of his own time Ten Hag looked like a quietly doomed knight-errant, out there still stubbornly riding his horse backwards into battle. Louis van Gaal: amusingly insane Dutch robot. José Mourinho: toxic super-villain. Ralf Rangnick: unhappy driving instructor. This place is an enchanted island. It will stretch you thin, twist you out of shape.

The difference this time is the club has actually done something new. Against all odds, bravely hurling the rulebook out of the window, Manchester United have appointed the right person. This is a novel concept all round. It is also a genuine test of the institution. It has been easy to grow resigned to the structural problems at this sclerotic super-club, the feeling as managers come and go of watching someone constantly changing the steering wheel cover on a car with a snapped timing belt.

![Image 1: Manuel Ugarte in action for Manchester United](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6124750d67d70ac4317644bd050a1d3deeb9eb/0_76_3657_2194/master/3657.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

But results, efficiency and good choices also have a tangible effect. Too many of those who came before were clearly out of their depth, symptoms of wider executive incompetence rather than a challenge to it. Well, here we have, if not the coming man of European football, then a coming man. We have a ruthlessness and self-possession, plus a new administration who have so far talked a good game without actually playing one. The ingredients are actually in place for something different. How’s this going to work out then?

Listing the potential pros and cons is fairly easy at this stage. All the good stuff is Amorim. All the bad stuff is Manchester United. The manager’s basic CV is hugely impressive. Domestic trophies, a compellingly intense Champions League presence, a Sporting team still on the rise four years in.

The optics are also compelling, and optics matter here. Amorim looks great. Beard, hair, jawline, tailoring. The eyes? The eyes are piercing. He looks like the handsome, successful man in an advert for caffeine-powered shampoo.

We already hear constant references to his Porsche, his personal charm, the energy of his press conferences. This shouldn’t matter, but it does. We’re dealing with magic, voodoo, haunted houses, extreme qualities of perseverance and resilience. Anybody walking through those doors needs to come tooled up with a pretty robust sense of self.

There has already been a vast amount of tactical analysis of Amorim’s teams and of his imaginary teams of the future. He likes to play three central defenders. In an ideal world [Lenny Yoro](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/31/manchester-united-leny-yoro-injury), Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martínez could be in line to form a theoretical dream backline, which does presuppose all three are going to be fit and in form at the same time. Rúben? Meet Jonny Evans. He’s quite useful.

There is early concern over the identity of potential wing-backs, but Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot is hardly the most notable bodge of recent Manchester United selections. Manuel Ugarte should be pleased to see his former mentor turning up. United have done something new here too. Reverse-engineer it. Sign the £50m holding midfielder. Then sign the right manager to actually make him work.

Otherwise phrases such as intensity, pressing, short passing and high defensive lines have swirled around. And yes, we have heard this before. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the Manchester United. Joining in the middle of the season doesn’t help either. But then, this just has to be a long-term project.

[skip past newsletter promotion](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-analysis-optics#EmailSignup-skip-link-15)after newsletter promotion

It is here that Amorim’s record comes into focus in other ways. Why is this a good fit? Try this. Sporting sold or released 30 professional players in his first seven months at the club. There is something almost sensually appealing about the idea of this process being enacted at Old Trafford. Oh yes. Raise the cleaver. Purge me daddy. Take that wire brush and scrape me down. Don’t talk about building, not yet. Just burn it all down.

Even better, Sporting traded at a combined profit of at least £200m across his four years in charge, while still moving forward, winning and getting better. This is not just impressive but overwhelmingly on point with where United are and how the owners work. This guy: he’s a one-man McKinsey. He’s Ineos in a €3,000 merino wool sports coat. He’s Kendall Roy striding the floor saying please leave your desks immediately, security will take your passes now.

This isn’t a criticism. It is instead necessary medicine at a club where filling the vast inherited hole at the heart of the midfield must go hand in hand with fixing the vast inherited hole at the heart of the institution. The astonishing amount of money spent on players endorsed by Ten Hag remains an affront to professional sports club administration. Somebody needs to fix this, recoup, regear.

United have played down the significance of their recently announced [£113m losses](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/11/manchester-united-financial-fair-play-113m-loss). But this remains a flashing red light, just as a two-year (probably) absence from the start of the regeared Champions League is a massive structural failure. Nothing lasts for ever. No brand is an island. And that boat is already leaving the port.

In this sense the message for United should be very simple. Every step taken must run the same simple test. Is this breaking the cycle? Is this the opposite of what went before? Didn’t fix the roof? Do fix the roof. Didn’t appoint the best available hyper-competent young manager? Do it now.

By the same token, the United job will continue to pull everyone out of shape until someone breaks that pattern. Amorim has been ruthless, driven and smart in the milder air of Lisbon. United simply need to back him from here. Not so much financially but in methods, style and internal decision-making; to make it work, finally, for the right man in the wrong place.

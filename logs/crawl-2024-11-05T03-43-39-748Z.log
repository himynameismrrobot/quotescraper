Manchester United midfielder Mason Mount has returned to training and is making progress in his return from injury.

Mount last played in the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham at end of September and has been absent from training and matchday squads since.

However, the Manchester Evening News can now reveal Mount is back in training, which represents the next step in his recovery.

**READ MORE:** [**Manchester United have to back Ruben Amorim by getting rid of eight players**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-back-ruben-amorim-30290717)

**READ MORE: [I played alongside Bruno Fernandes at Man United - he is misinterpreted and an excellent captain](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/played-alongside-bruno-fernandes-man-30291439)**

Whether Mount is available for selection before the November international break remains to be seen, though.

United play PAOK in the [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) on Thursday and Leicester City in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) at the weekend, but Mount won’t be rushed back and a source has confirmed he will be carefully handled to prevent a repeat injury.

Having struggled for form and fitness since joining the club from [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) last summer, Mount will be determined to impress new manager Ruben Amorim when he joins the club from Sporting CP a week today.

Mount's pressing ability was relied upon by Erik ten Hag in the opening fixtures of the campaign and he was a key cog in the team's tweaked pressing structure in attack.

But injuries have ruled him out of the last seven matches in all competitions, and he has featured in just 25 matches since joining last summer.

[United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) needed to sell players in the summer to generate funds and operate within PSR rules, but Mount had the backing from key figures inside the club to stay and become the important member of the squad they thought they were signing.

He will now look to maintain his fitness and prove his worth to Amorim, as he ushers in a new era at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

Manchester United have to back Ruben Amorim by getting rid of eight players
===========================================================================

If Man United are to execute Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 it will require at least five signings, which means at least five sales to go with those who will be released.

At eight o'clock outside the Stretford End on Sunday night, Manchester United supporters were still lined up. Bruno Fernandes had put in a shift on the pitch and it continued towards the car park as he fulfilled as many autograph and selfie requests as possible.

It was a night for the United captain to make time for the matchgoers after a respectable end to Ruud van Nistelrooy's first week in interim charge. It was not a bad draw with Chelsea but there was not a lot of good about it.

Noussair Mazraoui was United's most accomplished performer and, at the time of writing, he is one of two successful signings of the Erik ten Hag era. The other is Jonny Evans.

Evans was invited in to train with United by his old mate Darren Fletcher. Then he was invited to attend the pre-season tour. Then he was invited to sign a one-year contract. Then he ended up playing 30 games.

**READ MORE:** [**United failed to respond to Van Nistelrooy's tactical gesture**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/matthijs-de-ligt-reaction-shows-30288624)

**READ MORE:** [**A 7/10 and a 4/10 - United player ratings vs Chelsea**](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-player-ratings-vs-30288617)

That would only happen at United. Even a feel-good story like Evans' is cause for self-reflection and analysis.

There is another conundrum at centre back: how has Victor Lindelof survived eight years at United? Lindelof has started in two of the past four games and was teammates with Ruben Amorim at Benfica. They lunched together in the Carrington canteen during Amorim's internship at United in April 2018.

One hopes for United's sake that Amorim and the Ineos brains trust agree Lindelof should be released next summer. Ineos's card is already marked following a blinkered and Dutch-centric first transfer window. Mazraoui, hitherto the only success, signed the shortest contract of the five to arrive.

Players and their representatives have seen United dole out five-year contracts like Jordan Belfort flicking dollar notes. So they hold out for five years, which could be a quarter or a third of a player's career. Too often United yield.

The Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules have actually encouraged longer contracts through the amortisation practice as a player's fee is spread across the length of their contract. So Joshua Zirkzee, a £36.5million buy, is costing United a paltry £7.3m a year in their accounts.

Only Zirkzee does not resemble a footballer, never mind a striker. There were more disbelieving sighs from the stands during his meek cameo against Chelsea. It is now one goal in 15 games.

  

![Image 4: Zirkzee has been woeful](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291395.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2182060386.jpg)

Zirkzee has been woeful

The mess United have made of their striker situation is well documented. Rasmus Hojlund should be playing a role akin to Javier Hernandez yet is the number nine. He nor Zirkzee is a convincing starting striker.

Hojlund has hung off Alejadnro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo's coattails when on Sunday he failed to release Garnacho down the right and then the left-hand channel. Garnacho expressed his dismay, as he had at Zirkzee's glacial play against Fenerbahce.

With Hojlund, there are attributes to get behind. He is direct, quick and puts himself about. Zirkzee does not. He was seemingly signed as he had a release clause and is Dutch.

It is not too early to conclude United have to cut their losses on Zirkzee next year. Amorim's 3-4-3 formation requires a proven goalscorer. That is not Hojlund or Zirkzee, so one of them has to make way. Zirkzee is the inferior frontman and the more economical investment.

  

![Image 5: "Perhaps neither of us should start."](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30291397.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2181992216.jpg)

"Perhaps neither of us should start."

United have six senior centre halves yet there is more chance of them challenging for the title than the sextet being simultaneously available. Evans, Lindelof and Harry Maguire are out of contract in June, though United have the option of an additional year with the latter.

Lindelof has to be let go, Evans they can play by ear and retaining Maguire, a veteran of United and England back threes, would be prudent. Lindelof leaving would free up room for another incoming at centre back.

Maybe when Amorim has left-footed wing-backs fit he can drop Diogo Dalot for Mazraoui on the right. Left back has been United's problem position for upwards of a year and that department needs a thorough clearout.

The notion it would be extreme to discard two left backs is misplaced. Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola was underpinned by the departures of all four full backs in the 2017 summer.

  

![Image 6: All change at left back?](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30059069.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1250800933.jpg)

All change at left back?

Tyrell Malacia, behind schedule in his return from a long-term knee injury that has sidelined him for almost 18 months, will have a year remaining on his contract come the summer. You could count on one hand how many good games Malacia has had for United and he was a rare frugal addition.

Luke Shaw turns 30 in June and is already into his 11th year at United. Fernandes is 27 club appearances shy of Shaw's 275. Shaw made his debut in September 2014. Fernandes debuted in February 2020.

Shaw's conditioning and fitness have been risible for much of his time at United and his five-year renewal in April 2023 was excessive. The club cannot count on a player who put his country first during the European Championship, returned for pre-season three motnhs ago and got injured without participating in a full team training session.

Mason Mount and United was a mismatch from the get-go. Mount got a 'knock' five weeks ago and has been knocked out. If standards are to be restored at United, underperforming players cannot be afforded a third season. Antony has made it into a third but is such an irrelevance the severity of his ankle sprain has not been deemed newsworthy.

  

![Image 7: Antony has only offered tunnel vision](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29947173.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2171925489.jpg)

Antony has only offered tunnel vision

United's delay in bolstering their midfield has already had ramifications this season. Manuel Ugarte is floundering in the Premier League and will need a vibrant support cast if Amorim's 3-4-3 is to continue into his first full season.

Christian Eriksen, one of the few respectable performers at United this term, turns 33 in February and his deal expires in seven months. Casemiro turns the same age eight days later and there is a reason why he looked in his element against Leicester's reserves in the [League Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/football-league-cup).

The only signing they should be doing is for autographs.

Bruno Fernandes' passion to win at Manchester United is 'misinterpreted' as histrionics and he is an excellent captain.

That is the view of [Fernandes'](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) former [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) team-mate [Phil Jones,](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/phil-jones) who insists the Portuguese international midfielder is a leader who is 'really good' with the club's young players.

Jones was working as a pundit for the BBC for United's 1-1 draw at home to [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc), as Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Moises Caicedo's equaliser for the visitors.

Fernandes has never hidden his emotions on the pitch - positive or negative - and there have been question marks over whether his demeanour is befitting of a United captain.

However, Jones, who played alongside Fernandes at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) for three-and-a-half years, insists he is not only a brilliant player but a brilliant captain, too.

"I think he most certainly can," Jones told [Match of the Day 2](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qfl) when asked if he is the type of captain who can 'drag a team with him'.

"I almost get the impression he is misinterpreted at times and I can only go off my experience in the dressing room that I spent with him and the time I played with him.

"He is a leader in that dressing room, he is really good with the young lads and we all have different captains but he is a leader on the pitch in terms of the quality he brings.

"He is a player you build the team around. He has bags of ability, his range of passing is superb."

When asked if Fernandes 'cares too much', Jones replied: "Would that be a problem? I would rather that than the other way. I like that."

Footage of Casemiro dishing out a warning to Alejandro Garnacho for losing possession during Manchester United's draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) has gone viral.

Garnacho struggled against Chelsea on Sunday afternoon. He missed a handful of chances and was quiet against Malo Gusto, who managed to minimise the influence of the youngster.

The 20-year-old also received a rollicking from Casemiro in the second half when he lost the ball with a sloppy pass, which Pedro Neto intercepted. After winning the ball, Neto burst down the wing and was only stopped by a foul from Casemiro, who was furious with Garnacho.

The full exchange between Casemiro and Garnacho was recorded by a fan in the South Stand and it showed the Brazilian ripping into him for losing the ball and not recovering.

**ALSO READ: [United vs Chelsea as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-chelsea-score-30280008)**

In the footage, Casemiro begins to defend the free-kick and is high-fived by Lisandro Martinez and Bruno Fernandes for bringing Neto down when he was in a dangerous area.

Later in the game when there was a stoppage in added time, Casemiro and Garnacho were spotted hugging each other and appeared to be discussing their heated exchange.

There was no animosity between the pair and they settled the dispute before the final whistle. Casemiro's squad role has been gradually reduced in the last 18 months but he has broken back into the starting team in recent weeks and is still a leader in the dressing room.

Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy recently launched a passionate defence of Casemiro and said: "The way he's been training and helping the team, the club, it's such an example.

"You also see the crowd's reaction and they know what he's about. I'm delighted to have him around and going through difficult moments, he got a lot of criticism after the [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc) game.

"It's so hard, he was almost the one to blame for that game and it's not fair, he didn't deserve that and it's totally not true. If you see him train and prepare for games, with the history and all he's achieved with five Champions Leagues, he's an example for us and that was part of my celebration."

Sporting Lisbon manager Ruben Amorim spoke to the media on Monday afternoon to look ahead to Tuesday night's Champions League clash with Manchester City in the Portuguese capital.

[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim), as expected, was quizzed on a wide variety of topics, concerning both tomorrow night's game and his impending move to [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) next week.

The 39-year-old answered every question in his native Portuguese, refusing to speak in English when challenged by one reporter present. He joked that he will be 'missed' in Portugal and that he owes it to Sporting's fans to speak in his mother tongue.

Prior to Amorim holding court with members of the press, Sporting midfielder Morten Hjulmand answered questions and provided a detailed level of insight into what life has been like within the Sporting camp over the past week or so.

Amorim has just two games left in charge of Sporting, with his final home game being against [City.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc) His final game in charge is an away game at Braga on Sunday.

### Hjulmand on what United will be getting from Amorim

> "Of course, Ruben was one of the reasons why I came to Sporting. When you work with Ruben you see a clear picture. That was important when I joined Sporting - first to understand how he plays. The way that he manages the team inside the pitch and outside the pitch as well is not like I anything I have seen in my short career. I think Manchester \[United\] are in good hands with Ruben."

Sporting are making the right choice by taking him and I believe in them."

### City looking to get back on track

Following Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth, City will be itching to get back on track at the first available opportunity in the Portuguese capital.

Their defeat to the Cherries marked their first loss in any of competition this season, meaning they will travel to Sporting with the ambition of maintaining their unbeaten record in Europe this term.

In their opening threee Champions League league phase outings, City have drawn 0-0 with Inter Milan, beating Slovan Bratislava 4-0 and burshed Sparta Prague aside, winning 5-0.

*   24/11/2024: Ipswich Town (A) - Premier League

### Sporting's Champions League record so far this season

Sporting have made an encouraging start to their Champions League campaign, winning two of their opening three league phase matches.

They are currently eighth in the standings, but their upcoming fixtures against City and Arsenal will present them with their sternest challenges yet.

Sporting's 2024/25 Champions League results thus far:

*   Sporting 2-0 Lille
*   PSV Eindhoven 1-1 Sporting
*   Sturm Graz 0-2 Sporting

### What will be on the agenda?

Ruben Amorim will speak to the media this afternoon to look ahead to tomorrow night's Champions Legaue clash between Sporting Lisbon and City.

However, you can guarantee the topic of conversation will soon switch to his impending arrival at United, with the 39-year-old now exactly one week away from starting work at Old Trafford.

With that said, here is a flavour of what could be on the agenda today:

*   Thoughts on City
*   His final week at Sporting
*   Taking over at United
*   United's performance vs Chelsea
*   Being linked with replacing Pep Guardiola

### Amorim's final home game

Just a week away from becoming United's new head coach, it is quite fitting that Ruben Amorim's final home game in charge of Sporting Lisbon will be against City.

The two sides will meet in the Champions League league phase tomorrow night, with both sides still boasting unbeaten records in the competition so far this season.

City have won each of their opening three games and Sporting have won two and drawn one of their first three.

The visit of City will mark Amorim's final home game in charge of Sporting and he will be itching to bow out on a high ahead of moving to Manchester next week.

All eyes will be on [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) on Tuesday night as Sporting Clube de Portugal take on [Manchester United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) rivals, [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc), in the [Champions League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/uefa-champions-league).

The match will be Amorim's penultimate game in charge for Sporting [before completing a move to Old Trafford next Monday](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-appoint-ruben-amorim-30251457) (November 11). Sporting will host Pep Guardiola's side at Estadio Jose Alvalade and the Portuguese will be keen to leave a positive mark - as the majority of United's fanbase prepare to tune in.

‌  

When asked about that in his press-conference on Monday, [Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) namechecked [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson), [saying](https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-betclic/sporting/detalhe/em-direto-siga-a-conferencia-de-ruben-amorim-de-antevisao-ao-jogo-com-o-manchester-city?ref=HP_DestaquesPrincipais): "I know they will draw conclusions from this result, but it doesn't really matter to me.

"If the result is negative, expectations will lower. If we win, they'll think the new [Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) has arrived!"

Amorim chuckled to himself, at that point, and went on: "I'm Sporting's coach until the 11th.

"I understand the interest but, for me, it's another game against a team from the best league in the world."

‌  

After United announced Amorim as their new head coach last week, [Guardiola](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola) stated: "Welcome to United and England. I will congratulate him on Tuesday.

"We faced each other two or three seasons ago in the Champions League. Welcome. I'm not the right person to give advice to my colleagues. United have a lot of people who will tell him the situation in the club. I cannot give him any advice."

The Catalan faced Amorim twice as City manager after they met in the last-16 of the Champions League in 2022. City defeated the Lions 5-0 in the first leg in Lisbon - before a goalless draw in the second at the [Etihad Stadium](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/etihad-stadium).

[Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane) has described [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes)' apology to [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) as a matter of "too little, too late" following his departure from [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc). The Dutchman was relieved of his duties last Monday during his third season at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) - and a succession plan is in place.

Despite winning the [FA Cup](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup) and Carabao Cup, his efforts fell short of propelling United back to the pinnacle of football. [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) steps into the role as Ten Hag's successor, [assuming responsibilities from next Monday](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/do-better-ruben-amorim-already-30290438).

Meanwhile, Ruud van Nistelrooy, the club's interim manager, held [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) to a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. After that game, [Fernandes expressed regret over his own performance](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-legend-roy-keane-30293440) during Ten Hag's time when speaking to Sky Sports.

As quoted by [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-bruno-fernandes-manutd-34028472), he said: "When you see a manager go you have to look at the mirror first. I spoke to Erik ten Hag and I told him I apologise and I feel disappointed I couldn't do more for him. We should've done better.

"I wasn't scoring goals and I felt responsibility as I'm normally a player with a lot of goals and assists. The main thing is he's aware of that. Every week is challenging, it doesn't matter if you win or lose. It's a different week because we know Erik is gone."

Discussing the broader impact of managerial exits, Fernandes added: "It's not good for anyone at the club when a manager goes because it means that the position where the team is isn't the best, the results are not the best. We are all disappointed by that, you always have to take a little bit of the blame on yourself."

When the Sky Sports cameras returned to Keane in the studio, the iconic former United midfielder was far from receptive to what was being said. He said: "These are always awkward interviews for players but I wouldn't have much time and patience for the player to say; 'Listen, sorry, we let you down'. Too little, too late.

"We'll judge what you're doing on the football pitch. I don't think Bruno has done enough in a lot of the games already. He didn't show that leadership. So it would be interesting to hear what Ten Hag has to say about it. But you also have to move on.

"A lot of players don't care that much when a manager goes. They just focus on the next manager and get ready, and look after themselves. Players can be selfish, we know that... but I don't think Bruno done enough as a captain of Man United over the last year or two to help the manager out. Far from it."

Keane went on: "The proof's there with all the results. It's not just on Bruno, of course, but I don't think he showed enough leadership skills when the going's got tough with some of the performances. I don't think Bruno should be too proud of himself, of what's happened to the manager of the last week or two.

"I think the players let the manager down, ultimately."

Manchester United played their first game since the appointment of new head coach [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) at the weekend, although the new boss was watching from afar.

The current Sporting CP manager doesn’t officially start at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) until the upcoming international break, meaning that interim manager [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) was in the dugout for the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) clash against [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc). He will also be in charge for the upcoming matches against PAOK and Leicester City.

After overcoming Leicester in the Carabao Cup in the week, the clash against Chelsea was Van Nistelrooy's first league game as interim manager. Bruno Fernandes sparked celebrations from the Dutchman when he scored from the spot in the 70th minute after a foul from Robert Sanchez on Rasmus Hojlund.

**READ MORE: [Man United legend Roy Keane makes poppy decision after Joey Barton criticism](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-legend-roy-keane-30293440)**

But those celebrations lasted just four minutes before Chelsea equalised through Moises Caicedo. Despite chances for both sides, that’s how the game would end.

With the spoils shared, concentration for the national media in attendance was on the job that lies before Amorim when he does take over. Here’s what just some had to say after watching the draw against Chelsea.

#### [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14036321/Man-United-need-coaching-structure-identity-unpredictability-fallibility-Ruben-Amorim-sort-Erik-ten-Hags-chaos-quickly-writes-IAN-LADYMAN.html), Ian Ladyman

“The new United manager will know already what he is walking in to. United’s squad is not as poor as it sometimes looked under Ten Hag but it is far short of those working at clubs such as [Manchester City](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc), Arsenal and [Liverpool](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc). It is not at Chelsea’s level, either.

“Nevertheless, Amorim’s responsibility from the first moment will be to improve United quickly and fundamentally. This is a United squad and team that needs some coaching, some structure, some identity and something other than unpredictability and fallibility by which to recognise it.

“Amorim’s first significant transfer window remains eight months away. Opportunities in January are always limited. So the first stretch of his time in charge will very much be an examination of himself and his ability to impose his ideas on his players and build some kind of culture and belief system.”

#### [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-ruben-amorim-transfers-squad-b2640804.html), Richard Jolly

“Sir [Alex Ferguson](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson) was appointed in November 1986. If it is unfair to expect Amorim to have the impact the Scot did, he may not get the time either: he has an initial two-and-a-half-year contract, whereas Ferguson did not win a trophy for three and a half after his arrival.

“Half a century ago, meanwhile, United also had nine league goals after 10 games. At [Christmas](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/christmas), their goalkeeper, Alex Stepney, was their joint top scorer. At the end of the campaign, they were relegated. History is unlikely to repeat itself, unless Andre Onana reveals a clinical streak…

“Yet the nature of the opportunities is among the multitude of issues for Amorim to address. Some fall to the wrong players: Rasmus Hojlund had a lone touch in the box against Chelsea, though it did win a penalty. Marcus Rashford’s expected goals tally for the Premier League campaign is still under 1.0.”

#### [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/03/man-utd-vs-chelsea-live-score-latest-premier-league/), Simon Burt

“The in-tray for United’s next head coach, Ruben Amorim, who will have watched this game from his home in Portugal, will be large, daunting and near the top will be the need to get the basics right: signing players who are good enough.

“That will not be his responsibility, given the structure United have now put in place under sporting director Dan Ashworth, but the waste simply cannot go on especially after the half a billion spent under Erik ten Hag…

“…In a sense this game summed up United. It was neither one thing nor the other. It was a game that was far too open, too chaotic and yet not that exciting. They could have won and they could have lost. It had little sense of organisation, little identity and ended in an unsatisfactory no-man’s land of a draw. It was all a bit ‘meh’, in fact. It felt like drift which again raises the question whether United could have tried harder to bring Amorim in early and not during the international break. Are they wasting precious time or playing the long game?”

#### Sky Sports

Sky Sports pundits and United legends [Gary Neville](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/gary-neville) and Roy Keane had plenty to say on the appointment of Amorim at full-time of the draw against Chelsea. One of the things spoken about was the amount of time that the new man may need to turn things around.

"It took (Jurgen) Klopp four or five years, it might take Ruben Amorim four or five years to succeed," Neville said. "But you have got to have something \[success\] to hang your hat on."

Keane added: "You won't get that, he won't get three or four years. He has only signed a two-and-a-half year deal, the manager.”

Neville then said: "They are going to give him some time, you would imagine, and I wouldn't let him sign anyone in the transfer window. I would say look, let's see what these players can do for you for the next eight months."

But it was Keane who had the final word. "They say a type. They go after this manager, say he's going to be the one and the agreement, whatever, they give him a two-and-a-half-year deal," he said.

Lisandro Martinez has taken to social media after his contentious tackle on Cole Palmer during [Manchester United's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) match with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) - which ended in a 1-1 draw at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford).

The incident saw Martinez pick up his fourth booking of the season when he made a risky attempt to win the ball from [Palmer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cole-palmer)—a challenge that saw him receive a yellow card despite a VAR check. Although VAR deemed his action reckless, it did not warrant a red card for endangering the safety of the Chelsea and England star.

Chelsea fans were left fuming over the decision and felt it deserved a more severe punishment. Palmer, evidently affected by the incident, was spotted applying ice to his knee.

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is hopeful that the injury is not significant. He said: "He was there in the changing room with ice. We are waiting now. Hopefully, it's nothing important \[serious\]."

On Instagram, Martinez posted an image celebrating with teammates and conveyed perseverance with the caption: "Keep working and keep trying until the end, always as a team," accompanied by a flexed muscle emoji.

The message Lisandro Martinez posted on his Instagram story.

Reflecting on the situation, ex-[Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) referee Dermot Gallagher shared on Sky Sports' Ref Watch that he considered Martinez fortunate for avoiding a red card. "I think he's lucky," he stated.

"His starting position is close to Palmer, if he makes that challenge, comes in from distance, speed and intensity that's when he'll be in trouble. Because he's so close to him, he doesn't generate that force. It's fleeting contact. Because it's such a short distance, then he doesn't generate that intensity."

The match at Old Trafford ended with United climbing to 13th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) standings. [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) scored the opening goal from the penalty spot before Moises Caicedo's leveller just four minutes later.

Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez's booking at the end of the draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) has split opinion among experts in the aftermath.

With the game heading towards a draw, [the Argentine](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/lisandro-martinez) found himself in trouble when his studs caught [Cole Palmer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/cole-palmer) after the attacking midfielder had flicked the ball over the United man's head. Immediately, referee Rob Jones booked Martinez for the challenge, but as the opposition complained, [VAR](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/var) checked the incident.

After deliberation by Michael Salisbury, the decision was made to continue the game. However, that has not been the end of the debate. _MEN Sport_ has taken a look at the differing views of four ex-referees and the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) on the tackle.

### Premier League

Soon after the incident, the Premier League, through their Match Centre X account, explained the rationale of the VAR to not overturn the booking for Martinez. "The referee issued a yellow card to Martinez for a challenge on Palmer," they wrote.

"VAR checked for a potential red card and confirmed the referee’s call of no red card, deeming that it was a reckless challenge and not serious foul play."

### Mike Dean

After watching several replays, Dean added on co-commentary duties: "He’s come down, he’s just caught the end of his knee with his studs. There’s not a lot of force in it, it’s more of a glancing blow down across his knee rather than endangering the safety of an opponent."

### Dermot Gallagher

The co-host of [Sky Sports' Ref Watch](https://www.skysports.com/) Gallagher admitted that while the booking was correct, Martinez was mightily fortunate to escape further punishment. "I think he's lucky," he explained.

"His starting position is so close to Palmer, if he makes that challenge, comes in from distance, speed and intensity that's when he'll be in trouble. Because he's so close to him, he doesn't generate that force.

"It's fleeting contact. Because it's such a short distance, he doesn't generate that intensity."

### Keith Hackett

In his column for [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/11/03/football-outlaw-reckless-tackles-such-martinez-palmer/), ex-Premier League referee Hackett was less forgiving. "The landing area of the boot was on Palmer's knee and quite clearly it endangered the player's safety," he explained.

"Referee Rob Jones was in a good position to view the incident and decided yellow. He probably concluded that there was insufficient force behind Martinez's challenger to warrant a stronger sanction.

"That, for me, was a clear and obvious error and VAR should have asked the referee to go and review the incident on the pitchside monitor. We have seen a lot of yellow cards this season but the laws, which were penned to protect players by issuing red cards, should be enforced when appropriate.

"It was the type of tackle that can end a player's career. The Professional Game Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) should be more rigorous in enforcing this policy.

"Jones has had his career enhanced this season by taking charge of some big matches and this game at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) was probably his biggest yet, but he has been let down on this occasion by VAR."

### Jeff Winter

Concluding the analysis on the incident, another ex-top flight referee Winter told [Grosvenor Casino](https://www.grosvenorcasinos.com/): "This shouldn't affect the referee's decision, but he possibly didn't catch him as badly as he could have done. But when you look, if it was a slightly late tackle you could feel for the defender, but he was nowhere near the ball, it was the other side of him.

"I think the commentator saying it was an orange was a very kind assessment of that, because it could have quite easily have been a red. One thing that happened in that incident, I was always taught as a referee, if you're going to send a player off when there's been a really bad tackle, no matter how good the potential advantage is, you don't play on.

"Because if that potential advantage breaks down then there's repercussions between players and the action, so you can totally lose control of the game. When if you'd have just stopped the game and issued an early red card, it would have calmed it all down.

"So, I think the referee who did have a good game and was well placed, I think he's immediately known it's not a red card in his mind, but I think Martinez, now it's not for the first time in his career, was rather fortunate with that one. A different referee, a different day... \[he could have been sent off\] and this is the frustrating thing about VAR, sometimes it uses a little bit of common sense and says leave it to the referee. Other times, needlessly, in my opinion, they get involved."

There was no doubting Ruud van Nistelrooy's passion for Manchester United since he became interim manager at Old Trafford last Monday.

In two matches at the Theatre of Dreams, [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) kicked every ball and wore his heart firmly on his sleeve as [the Reds](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) secured a safe passage to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and a 1-1 draw with Chelsea. It is no secret that the Dutchman would like to remain at Old Trafford beyond this week even though he was appointed on the recommendation of [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag), even if that means moving away from his assistant head coach role.

The players want him to stay too, if [Sky Sports'](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13248186/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-utd-players-want-club-legend-to-remain-at-old-trafford-under-ruben-amorim) report on Monday is to be believed, as they like how he communicates with them. Van Nistelrooy certainly did not hang his players out to dry in his post-match interview either describing the players as a 'good group' which clearly irked [Roy Keane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane).

**READ MORE: [Van Nistelrooy hints at United injury boosts](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruud-van-nistelrooy-hints-manchester-30291922)**

**READ MORE: [United players' 'true feelings' on Van Nistelrooy clear](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-players-true-feelings-30292215)**

"Don't worry about the result then because he said they were good lads? That's key," Keane replied sarcastically. "Oh they are great lads, we don't have to worry about football results then. I would rather work with bad lads who put a shift in.

"I know it is an awkward question for him, he is not going to say they aren't good guys. What is a good group?"

It was trademark stuff from Keane after yet another underwhelming display by [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) which some could pass off as 'Roy being Roy,' but it is evidence of an underlying problem with keeping Van Nistelrooy at the club post-[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) appointment. Unfortunately, while he is a club icon he is also potentially blinded to the problems this set of players have.

The reason Ineos sacked [Ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) was because they felt fresh ideas needed to be implemented and, in fairness, that looks set to be coming with Amorim and his coaching staff. But where exactly does Van Nistelrooy fit into that model?

  

![Image 4: Ruud van Nistelrooy acknowledges the Manchester United fans at Old Trafford](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article30295703.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-2182698794.jpg)

Ruud van Nistelrooy acknowledges the Manchester United fans at Old Trafford

Amorim does not need another person in the coaching room to tell him about the dynamics of this team. Ultimately, every single player in that dressing room has to be held responsible for Ten Hag's departure and completely fresh eyes to analyse which players are underperforming and which are simply not good enough, is needed.

Undoubtedly Amorim will lean on the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte, who he has worked with before, to give an insight into this team. Is Van Nistelrooy also needed in an advisory role? Perhaps not.

It would be a shame to see Van Nistelrooy go especially as he is a bright young coach but now that Amorim has been chosen to implement his style on United, he just does not fit. Could the United squad want him to stay to fight their battles for them? Potentially, but that is simply not reason enough to keep him around.

Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has agreed with the decision to award [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) a penalty against [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc).

After an underwhelming first-half display, [Ruud van Nistelrooy's](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) side were handed a golden opportunity to go in front after Robert Sanchez hauled down the [Dane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/rasmus-holjund) in the box. Holjund's touch took it beyond the shot-stopper who brought him down as he looked to smother the ball.

[Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) made no mistake and sent the Spanish goalkeeper the wrong way, handing [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) the lead. However, the advantage was short-lived as Moises Caicedo levelled proceedings before both sides were forced to settle for a point after failing to find the elusive second goal.

While there were Chelsea protests for the spot-kick being awarded, Gallagher sided with referee Rob Jones. He said: "I thought penalty at the time.

"\[I\] Still think \[it's a\] penalty, \[Sanchez\] doesn’t get any of the ball, catches the ankle. It isn’t too dissimilar to Ederson on Anthony Gordon, which I thought was a penalty.

"Doesn’t get any of the ball. When you see it in slow motion, everything looks distorted - I think it’s a foul. He’s challenged with his arms, not taken the ball, caught him on the ankle, referee gives a penalty, I don’t think VAR will ever overrule it. We want referees to make on-field calls."

There were appeals for a penalty in the first half when Holjund went down holding his face after a collision with Levi Colwill, but nothing was given. United sit 13th in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) table and will be hoping to head into the November international break with a win over Leicester City, next Sunday.

Manuel Ugarte has revealed Manchester United's players were surprised by Ruben Amorim's age following his appointment as head coach.

[Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) is regarded as one of Europe's brightest coaching prospects and the 39-year-old has joined from Sporting Lisbon, where he masterminded their first league title for 19 years.

United believe they have appointed a coach who has the style of play, personality and winning mentality needed for the role, along with a reputation for developing young players. His first game in charge of United will come against Ipswich Town in the league on November 24.

There is excitement building ahead of Amorim's arrival and Ugarte, who played at Sporting for two years, has been asked questions from his United teammates about him.

During Amorim's career as a player, he shared a dressing room with Victor Lindelof at Benfica and played against Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans. He is also just nine months older than the oldest player in the squad, goalkeeper Tom Heaton, who is 38.

After the 1-1 draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) on Sunday, Ugarte spoke to DAZN Portugal about Amorim and he revealed the new United boss' age had been a topic of discussion in the dressing room.

"There are many questions about him from my colleagues," he said. "What surprised them was his age. He also has a strong desire to win, which is very important. I can tell you that they'll like him.

"I saw that Sporting fans were upset and it's understandable because he is a great coach. It’s good for United and we need to make the most of it and for him to convey his ideas as quickly as possible.

"I believe it will be a different dynamic, and the day-to-day will be somewhat similar to that we had at Sporting. The league changes, the country changes, and the football changes.

"It’s a significant challenge for him, but we all know he possesses the capability. It’s positive, especially since the club needs to start building a path, which is essential, and the manager will be key."

Amorim will officially begin work in Manchester on November 11, which is the first day of the upcoming international break, and Ruud van Nistelrooy's future remains uncertain.

Van Nistelrooy is managing United on an interim basis until Amorim arrives at Carrington and has confirmed he would like to stay in his first-team coach role.

Manchester United's squad reportedly want Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay at the club despite Ruben Amorim's impending arrival as manager.

[Van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) arrived at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) in the summer on the recommendation of previous manager [Erik ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag). The Dutchman became the Reds' assistant manager following the departures of [Mitchell van der Gaag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/mitchell-van-der-gaag) and Steve McClaren at the beginning of the campaign.

It was deemed by some that Van Nistelrooy was being groomed to replace Ten Hag as manager should he be sacked but this theory proved to be untrue. When the United boss left last week, the former PSV Eindhoven head coach stepped up to become interim manager while Ineos search for a replacement.

Once Amorim was appointed last Friday, United confirmed that Van Nistelrooy would lead the team up until November 11 when the Portuguese coach begins work in Manchester. Since taking over, the Dutchman has overseen a victory over Leicester City in the Carabao Cup and a draw to [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

Van Nistelrooy will be in the dugout for this Thursday's [Europa League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/europa-league) clash with PAOK and the match with Leicester in the Premier League before stepping aside. However, it is currently unclear whether he will remain at the club once Amorim starts.

According to [Sky Sports](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13248186/ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-utd-players-want-club-legend-to-remain-at-old-trafford-under-ruben-amorim), the United players would want the legendary striker to stay as they feel he has become a good go-between the squad and the management staff. It is also thought that first-team coach [Darren Fletcher](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher) is held in high regard for his work bridging the gap between the academy and the first-team.

Amorim has already confirmed that he will be bringing his coaching team to Old Trafford next week and this makes it difficult for Van Nistelrooy to stay on in his current role as assistant. However, the 48-year-old is believed to be open to staying at United which could hint at him being flexible in regards a new job title.

Bruno Fernandes has admitted he apologised to former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag after he was sacked last week.

[Ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/erik-ten-hag) was dismissed by United last Monday after overseeing just three victories from the club's opening nine [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) matches this season.

United moved swiftly to appoint the Dutchman's successor, turning to Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim, who will officially take charge at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) on November 11.

**READ MORE:** **[United failed to respond to Ruud van Nistelrooy’s attempted tactical change vs Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/matthijs-de-ligt-reaction-shows-30288624)**

Until Amorim arrives in England, [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) is holding the fort, and he oversaw a 1-1 draw with [Chelsea](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc) at Old Trafford on Sunday, meaning he has won one and drawn one of his opening two games in caretaker charge.

United thought they were going to bag a much-needed Premier League win after [Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) fired them ahead after 70 minutes, converting a penalty, only for Moises Caicedo to haul Chelsea level four minutes later with a brilliant strike.

Speaking to the media for the first time since Ten Hag exited the club, Fernandes revealed he apologised to the former manager after the club made the decision to dismiss him, admitting he felt as though he contributed to the decision.

"We know that Erik has gone, it is not good for anyone at the club when the manager goes," Fernandes admitted, speaking to Sky Sports. "The team is not the best, the results are not the best and he is the one who pays for it.

"Whenever you see a manager go you have to take some of the blame on yourself, it is because the team is not doing so well. It is easier to get rid of a manager than 15 players.

"I spoke to the manager \[Ten Hag\] and apologised to him, I was disappointed he has gone and I tried to help him. I wasn't scoring goals, we are not scoring goals and I feel responsible.

"I normally score a lot of goals but I always gave 100 per cent. He is aware of that."

Jose Mourinho launched a furious rant against VAR following Fenerbahce's controversial clash against Trabzonspor. Sofyan Amrabat fired the former [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) boss' side to victory late into stoppage time as [the Süper Lig title race builds a head of steam](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ten-hag-20-mourinho-claim-30278707).

Fred put Fenerbahce ahead shortly before the break. In the second half, [Trabzonspor were controversially awarded two penalties in quick succession](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ruben-amorim-discovered-first-manchester-30288187) – and Simon Banza converted both to take the lead.

Edin Dzeko, who replaced Sebastian Szymański, found an equaliser with quarter of an hour to play. Then, 12 minutes into added time, [Amrabat fired Fenerbahce ahead to snatch all three points](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jose-mourinho-believes-manchester-united-30267039).

As the midfielder's strike nestled into the net, [the Papara Park erupted into pandemonium](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jose-mourinho-jokes-manchester-united-30211657). Mourinho ran onto the pitch and, after hilariously failing to knee slide, he was bundled by his players and coaching staff.

While Fenerbahce waltzed away victorious, [Mourinho was left furious with the referee](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jose-mourinho-wants-manage-manchester-29123484), who he called 'invisible', a 'little boy' and the man of the match. The Portuguese tactician also incredibly claimed that he would have never taken a job in Turkey if he had been told the 'the whole truth' about match officials.

In an interview with beIN SPORTS, he pulled no punches. Mourinho said: "Today, the man of the match was \[VAR referee\] Atilla Karaoglan. We didn’t see him, but he was the referee of the match. The referee was just a little boy who was there on the pitch, but the referee was Atilla Karaoglan.

"He went from the invisible man to the most important man of the match. I speak on behalf of all Fenerbahce fans: we don’t want him again. We don’t want him because it smells bad. We don’t want him. We don’t want him on the pitch, but on the VAR even less.

"I know what I was told, even before I came. I didn’t believe. It’s even worse than I was told. But I prefer to be on this side. It’s more difficult. It’s more difficult because we play against good opponents like Trabzonspor is: good opponent with lots of good players and a historical coach.

"But we play against a system. And to play against a system is the most difficult thing. Tonight we play against a good team, against a strong atmosphere, against VAR, and against a system. So very hard. That’s why we celebrated this victory so much."

Mourinho added: "It’s unbelievable to win this match against so many powerful people. We are not going to give up. We know what we have. I blame the Fenerbahce people that brought me here! They told me only half of the truth.

"They didn’t tell me the whole truth, because if they told me the whole truth I wouldn’t come! But with half of the truth, with my boys we fight the opponent, we fight the system."

Mourinho didn't stop there. On [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/josemourinho/), the former United boss posted a video of a Trabzonspor player allegedly committing a hand-ball offence inside the box – which didn't result in a penalty for Fenerbahce. He captioned the clip: "Watch and smile. If you like it watch the game because the funny situations dont stop with this clip."

His post has already eclipsed half a million likes – one of which being Diogo Dalot – and almost 20,000 comments.

Manchester United drew 1-1 with Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.

[Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruud-van-nistelrooy) secured a dominant 5-2 victory over Leicester City in his first game as interim boss earlier in the week and the Dutchman was present on the touchline again.

The appointment of [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) from Sporting Lisbon was confirmed on Friday and his first match as United head coach will come against Ipswich Town on November 24.

Amorim will watch United from Portugal until he arrives and there were positives and negatives to take from Sunday's draw, with the points being shared between the two sides.

**ALSO READ: [United vs Chelsea as it happened](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/live-manchester-united-chelsea-score-30280008)**

Here are the moments you might have missed from the game...

**Casemiro couldn't watch**

Rasmus Hojlund won the penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted to open the scoring against Chelsea and Casemiro chose to stand on the halfway line and look away from the action.

Casemiro was crouched on the halfway line and looking at Andre Onana, who was facing the action, when the penalty was taken and they shared a warm embrace when it was converted.

Whether Casemiro chose not to watch the penalty out of superstition or was simply too nervous to watch is up for debate. Either could be true because United have been so wasteful this season and it wouldn't have been a surprise if Fernandes had missed from the spot.

United lacked quality in the final third against Chelsea and their performance was summed up by Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes ballooning late chances into the Stretford End.

Only Crystal Palace and Southampton have scored fewer goals in the Premier League than United this term and Amorim must address the team's problems in front of goal.

**The set-piece coach**

It seemed bizarre that Van Nistelrooy had to turn and instruct set-piece coach Andreas Georgson to come down to the touchline when Chelsea had their first corner of the game.

Georgson was appointed to the backroom staff in the summer to take charge of United's set-piece planning, but Van Nistelrooy had to encourage him to leave the bench.

Most Premier League teams have set-piece coaches and they tend to rush down to the touchline when a corner or free-kick is being taken. Georgson's first appearance on the touchline was around 11 minutes in and he stood helpless as Chelsea smashed the post.

Noni Madueke was unmarked in the box and the winger might have scored if he hadn't been clattered by his teammate. After that corner, Georgson appeared on the touchline whenever a set-piece was awarded.

**Van Nistelrooy's message**

It didn't take long to recognise United were losing the midfield battle against Chelsea. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte delivered strong performances against Leicester earlier in the week but they were both off the pace against Chelsea and the glaring space in midfield returned.

The South American pair struggled in the first half and their passing was wayward and sloppy, with Van Nistelrooy feeling the need to offer some words of advice after 20 minutes.

When Chelsea had a goal kick and there was a moment to pass on instructions, Van Nistelrooy shouted at Casemiro and Ugarte and told them to tighten up by gesturing with his hands.

Van Nistelrooy said United were 'light in midfield' in his pre-match press conference and he'll be hoping that Kobbie Mainoo is available before his final game in charge.

**Country roads**

There was a belting rendition of 'Take Me Home' before kick-off. The song was introduced for this season and is played following 'This Is The One' when the players walk out.

"To Old Trafford, to see Unitedddddd, take me home, United road," was aired as the players embraced in a huddle and it was the loudest rendition of the song so far this season.

That is because Erik ten Hag has been sacked and there is renewed optimism at Old Trafford.

**The warm-up is worth watching**

If you have a season ticket at Old Trafford or get the chance to attend the occasional fixture, it's worth keeping an eye on the pre-match warm-up as it can often hint at the team's tactics.

United practice crosses as part of their pre-game routine and Diogo Dalot will play crosses in from the fight flank if he's been selected to start at right-back. That's exactly what happened ahead of Chelsea and Noussair Mazraoui was on the other side, which indicated he'd start at left-back.

Former United manager Erik ten Hag started the new campaign with Dalot on the left side of defence but the 25-year-old struggled on that side and was recently relocated.

Watching the warm-up might sound mundane but it can be worth it.

Fernandes and Mazraoui celebrate

Manchester United drew 1-1 with Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday in Ruud van Nistelrooy’s first league game as interim head coach.

Both sides hit the frame of the goal in the opening 45 minutes with Noni Madueke’s header bouncing back off the post and Marcus Rashford’s late volley striking the crossbar.

United took the lead midway through the second half as Rasmus Hojlund was brought down in the area by Robert Sanchez and Bruno Fernandes converted the resulting penalty. The visitors hit back just four minutes later when Moises Caicedo’s volley found the bottom corner.

Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford.

**Andre Onana**

His kicking was iffy at times amid Chelsea's pressing and Moises Caicedo’s strike was not quite in the corner. 6

**Diogo Dalot**

Another sub-par performance accompanied by a deserved booking for a deliberate and cynical foul. Calmer in the second half but had no influence. 5

**Matthijs de Ligt**

Executed a good block to thwart Cole Palmer early in the first half. Showed good leadership at times with United often under pressure. 6

**Lisandro Martinez**

Back at centre back and better for it. Used the ball cooler than most teammates. Still too pent-up with elements of his play. 6

**Noussair Mazraoui**

United's best player and only good performer in a first half of random play. Showed why he should have started the season at left back. 7

**Casemiro**

Had to be told to be more compact with Manuel Ugarte by Van Nistelrooy. Survived some awkward spells to make the penalty happen. 6

**Manuel Ugarte**

Still floundering at Premier League level. Bossed by Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia and booked for a cynical shove on Cole Palmer. 5

**Marcus Rashford**

Cushioned a volley against the woodwork with the final kick of the first half. Ineffective but worked hard before he made way for Amad in the 72nd minute. 5

**Bruno Fernandes**

Tried without succeeding before half-time but created a chance for Rashford. Converted the penalty for his first league goal of the season. 6

**Alejandro Garnacho**

A physical mismatch against Malo Gusto in possibly his weakest performance of the season. Had three good goalscoring openings and underhit them all. 4

**Rasmus Hojlund**

Started bullishly and looked a physical match for Wesley Fofana and Levi Colwill but regressed and irked the crowd with delayed passes for Garnacho. Won the penalty through a heavy touch. 5

**Subs**

**Amad**

Had little of the ball. 5

**Joshua Zirkzee**

Did not look like a striker again. 4

**Victor Lindelof**

A short stint in midfield. 5

**Manager**

Picked the logical team with ten players absent and patiently delayed a substitution amid limited options on the bench. Turned to the right man in Amad. 6

Some Man United players' futures are becoming more certain as valuation changes - Samuel Luckhurst
==================================================================================================

Man United now have to get into the habit of not letting the manager solely decide players' futures. That forward planning has already started.

The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on [Harry Maguire](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire) but [Ten Hag](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about-erik-ten-hag) made it about Maguire.

"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it," Ten Hag said with relief. "You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four."

Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager.

Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.

**EXCLUSIVE: [Some United players delaying decisions on futures](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-players-delaying-decisions-28992949)**

Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.

Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.

The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.

At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.

Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.

This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.

  

![Image 4: Maguire soldiered on at Bournemouth](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29009808.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_GettyImages-2147781724.jpg)

Maguire soldiered on at Bournemouth

Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.

Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.

Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.

United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.

  

![Image 5: Casemiro struggled again at the weekend](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29009809.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-2148536142.jpg)

Casemiro struggled again at the weekend

Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.

Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.

United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.

Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.

However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.

Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.

Jason Wilcox will encounter familiar Manchester United transfer problem with no obvious solution
================================================================================================

Man Utd need to make at least a couple of key signings during the summer transfer window but getting away from the 'United tax' is never easy.

Jason Wilcox will lead United's recruitment plans this summer

A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. "When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million."

Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc).

They encountered it in [Erik ten Hag's first window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news), when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. "You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money," Murtough was told.

**ALSO READ: [Ten Hag has hinted at biggest United change this summer](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-hinted-biggest-29106572)**

The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.

That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for [Casemiro](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/casemiro) and Antony a couple of years ago.

This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.

In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.

United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.

Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.

It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.

That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.

Why Erik ten Hag is in a more secure position than previous Manchester United managers
======================================================================================

Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.

Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league) anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) can.

The misfiring [Antony](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/antony) is not assured of keeping his place and [Christian Eriksen](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/christian-eriksen), back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.

Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.

**READ MORE: [Only one United centre half is certain of staying next season](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/only-one-manchester-united-centre-28328724)**

**READ MORE: [Eight United players face an uncertain winter transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/eight-manchester-united-players-facing-28324556)**

De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.

As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.

That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.

There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.

Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.

The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.

The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.

  

![Image 4: Mourinho was named United manager five months after scarves were sold bearing his name and face](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article10680412.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS79409966.jpg)

Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.

There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.

Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.

  

![Image 5: Potter is not a credible threat to Ten Hag for now](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article24693798.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-1413423123.jpg)

Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.

United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.

Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.

That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.

There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.

[Sancho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho) has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.

Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.

**ALSO READ:** **[Dan Gore's journey to United debut](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/scoring-100-goals-season-sharing-28278214)**

"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards," said Ten Hag two weeks ago. "What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen."

Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.

Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.

Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and [Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nemanja-matic-claims-jadon-sancho-28228919) to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.

Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, [Raphael Varane](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/raphael-varane) this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.

He wrote: "As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.

"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.

"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things."

It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.

Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.

The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.

Sir Dave Brailsford is sounding out former staff at [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) as the Ineos Group prepares to make sweeping changes at the club.

[Brailsford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/dave-brailsford), the Ineos sporting director, is conducting thorough due diligence and a source has suggested the changes at United could be "brutal".

United sources say Brailsford has been attending meetings this month to gauge the performance challenge at United, whose title drought is certain to tick past 12 years.

Although Ineos plan to hire a sporting director and potentially a head of recruitment, the incumbent football director John Murtough wants to remain at the club.

A club source said in December it was "in the balance" as to whether Murtough stays at United or ends his decade-long association with the club.

**READ MORE: [How the United squad will look after the transfer window](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/what-manchester-united-squad-look-28456366)**

The Manchester Evening News revealed last month [Ineos are open to retaining Murtough in a more administrative role](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/ineos-target-dan-ashworth-stance-28308415) and Murtough never envisaged his role at United to centre on recruitment.

United have backed manager Erik ten Hag with investment of more than £400million on signings and sources have stressed they were tracking certain targets before the Dutchman was appointed in April 2022.

However, Murtough feels his involvement in picking players has been limited and six of Ten Hag's permanent additions played in the Eredivisie.

Brailsford and Jean Claude Blanc, the Ineos chief executive for sport, are due to join the United football board. A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently.

Blanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday.

"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.

Tyler and Jack were regulars in the [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford) directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.

The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, [Darren](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/darren-fletcher). The [United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.

The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.

Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.

It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.

Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.

If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.

Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.

It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.

Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.

Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.

The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.

A 16-year-old Darren Fletcher at The Cliff in April 2000

Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.

Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.

The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.

Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.

United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to "keep it as low-key as possible", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.

Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.

On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.

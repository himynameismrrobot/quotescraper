Dimitar Berbatov leaves Jamie Carragher in stitches with 'unexpected' analysis of Fulham's late win over Brentford
==================================================================================================================

Harry WIlson scored a late brace to sink Brentford.

**Dimitar Berbatov delivered an iconic piece of analysis on Monday Night Football after Fulham substitute Harry Wilson scored twice in stoppage time to complete the most dramatic of comebacks against Brentford.**

Thomas Frank's side took the lead with their first shot on target at Craven Cottage, as Vitaly Janelt beat goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the 24th minute with a stinging left-footed strike from range.

To their credit, [Fulham](https://www.sportbible.com/fulham) responded well and continued to dominate possession but their lack of decisiveness in front of goal continued to frustrate the Craven Cottage faithful.

Advert

In the 82nd minute, Marco Silva decided to replace Reiss Nelson with Harry Wilson, which turned out to be an inspired change from the Portuguese manager.

Wilson equalised with a spectacular chip over [Brentford](https://www.sportbible.com/brentford) keeper Mark Flekken and four minutes later, in the 96th minute of stoppage time, the [Wales](https://www.sportbible.com/wales) international netted a diving header after some great play from full-back Antonee Robinson.

It was a remarkable ending made even more memorable by former [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) and Fulham striker [Dimitar Berbatov](https://www.sportbible.com/dimitar-berbatov), who put his own 'unique' spin on the game.

Advert

Speaking in the MNF studio, Berbatov said: "I'll tell you something, this is the type of game where after the game, babies are made."

Jamie Carragher burst into laughter at the comment, as did Sky presenter Dave Jones, who said he "wasn't expecting that one" before the coverage cut to a commercial break.

Here's how fans on social media reacted to Berbatov's analysis.

One said: "Berbatov on MNF, 'After this type of game babies are made'. Probably not wrong. Some finish," while another wrote: "Berbatov: this is the kind of game where after babies are made. Get him on TV more, he's been brilliant."

Advert

A third commented: "Dimitar Berbatov summarising Fulham’s injury time win “guys, these are the types of games where babies are made after” Quality."

A fourth wrote: "Quote of the Year by Dimitar Berbatov after Fulham 2, Brentford 1...'This is the sort of game where babies are made afterwards,'" and a fifth added: "One of the best I’ve seen on MNF."

Sporting Lisbon fan gives insight into what Man Utd fans should expect from Ruben Amorim and it's gone viral
============================================================================================================

Amorim has been praised for "resurrecting a sleeping giant" at Sporting.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A Sporting Lisbon fan has given Manchester United supporters an insight into what Ruben Amorim has managed to achieve since he took over the Portuguese club in 2020.**

It was finally confirmed on Friday that one of Europe's most exciting and highly-rated young coaches, [Ruben Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim), will succeed Erik ten Hag as [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united)'s next head coach.

The 39-year-old, who has signed a contract until June 2027 with the option of a further year, is set to take charge of his first game at Ipswich on November 24 but will officially join on November 11 – just a day after Sporting's trip to Braga.

Advert

It would be an understatement to say Amorim has a major job on his hands. So far, United have picked up just three wins from a possible 10 games in the league, and have yet to record a victory in Europe.

But one Sporting fan has faith in the young manager. In fact, he backed Amorim to succeed at Old Trafford in a lengthy social post that has since gone viral.

Responding to a video on Amorim's impact at [Sporting](https://www.sportbible.com/sporting-lisbon), the fan wrote: "Sporting fan here. That is a very accurate description of Amorim's revolution of football. It is by far the best football played by the club in 40 years, and in a country of cunning coaches and players, no one has yet found the antidote for it.

Advert

"Just for more context, Amorim joined a broken club. The fans had attacked players and half left. There was no money, record low attendance... horrible football.

"In a broken club that demands wins but has half the money of [Benfica](https://www.sportbible.com/benfica) and [Porto](https://www.sportbible.com/porto), and whose pressure on coaches is almost infamous and usually eats them by the dozen, here comes Amorim.

"\[He was\] a coach for two years at that point, can he do it? Yes he can. He recalls loaned players, promotes youth, gets some rejects from other clubs, changes to his infamous 3 -4 -3 and is champion in his first year."

Amorin, who took the Sporting job in 2020 following a short stint at Braga, has guided his team to two [Primeira Liga](https://www.sportbible.com/primeira-liga) titles during an impressive four-year reign.

Advert

In total, Amorim has taken charge of 156 league games but more impressively, he boasts the best win ratio of any Sporting coach on record, winning 120 of those previously mentioned matches in the Portuguese top-flight.

The fan continued: "It is now year four, Sporting have won another league title, their second in four years. It has full stadiums every game, win or lose we cheer. \[We have\] made more money in sales in the last four years then the last 20 combined, losing key players but never loosing strength.

"Sporting's win average has skyrocketed and we are honored with amazing football every week. And also until this year, Sporting's team didn't have a proper striker. This year they gave him one......just look at the stats.

Advert

"This man and his team by their craft alone resurrected a sleeping giant with half of the money that his direct competitors had. You keep asking that same question that we did... is he ready? Let me answer for you, are you ready for him?"

Thoughts on United's appointment of Amorim? Let us know in the comments.

Ruben Amorim has incredibly awkward exchange with reporter after being persistently asked to speak in English during press conference

Amorim spoke to the press ahead of Sporting CP's Champions League clash against Manchester City.

**Ruben Amorim was involved in an awkward exchange with Sky Sports reporter Gary Cotterill during a pre-match press conference on Monday, after the Portuguese coach was asked to speak in English.**

The 39-year-old, who was [named Manchester United's new head coach on Friday](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/man-utd-ruben-amorim-manager-186278-20241029) following days of intense speculation, will officially join the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) club on November 11.

But before doing so, he will take charge of his penultimate game at [Sporting CP](https://www.sportbible.com/sporting-lisbon) as they host Manchester City in the Champions League league phase on Tuesday night.

Advert

“My focus is on winning the match for Sporting," he said ahead of the game in Lisbon. "The conclusions are not important for me because they could be erroneous: if we win tomorrow they will think the new Alex Ferguson has arrived."

Amorim added: "That will be very difficult. It could increase expectations, I don’t know what is better when I start my new adventure.”

Throughout the press conference, [Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) appeared relatively relaxed as he spoke in his native Portuguese.

Advert

When asked a handful of questions in English, however, his press officer interrupted and said English journalists would get answers when he officially starts at United later this month.

Sky Sports reporter Gary Cotterill, meanwhile, was determined to get an answer in English, and asked on multiple occasions if he could reciprocate.

"You could be a hero even before you get on a plane to Manchester. Has that crossed your mind?" said Cotterill, who then proceeded to ask if he could answer in English.

Amorim then responded: "Mmm sorry, I cannot speak in English, no."

Advert

As you can see in the footage below, Cotterill questioned why on two occasions but Amorim was intent. "Sorry... they will miss me in Portugal," he said. "So I have to speak in Portuguese."

Cotterill then hit back, saying: "They've had about 25 minutes in Portuguese. We want 10 seconds in English... It's like a cold shoulder to all your English fans."

Amorim, who speaks good English having completed some of his UEFA coaching qualifications in Belfast, admitted that his communication skills will be "more basic" when he first arrives at [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd).

Advert

"My communication at the beginning will be simpler because it is in English," he said, as quoted by the [**Daily Mail**](https://x.com/NathSalt1/status/1853451120334565565). "I think I will have to spend three months... they say that is enough. The players will not be offended if I say that they are more basic. I give training sessions here in English."

He added: "It will be a different adaptation, but my life will be the same, there is a way of playing, an idea. But communication will be more basic."

**A former scout has "heard whispers" about Arsenal's interest in one of the Premier League's most sought-after strikers, but they would have to spend a significant sum to get their man.**

Arsenal's activity in the next transfer window will certainly be a topic of discussion after it was reported that Edu Gaspar, the club's sporting director, will step down from his role.

Edu is set to take on a new role at Nottingham Forest once his exit from [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) is confirmed, according to [**The Athletic**](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5806690/2024/11/04/arsenal-edu-leaves-club/), who claim there is an agreement in place that will see the former midfielder take on 'a fresh challenge' under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis.

Advert

Marinakis, meanwhile, is ready to ['triple' Edu's current salary and offer him the chance to become CEO](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/arsenal/mikel-arteta-edu-departure-real-reason-979289-20241104); something he was unable to do at Arsenal.

The news around Edu's impending departure comes just days after [the Gunners suffered a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/arsenal/arsenal-newcastle-mikel-arteta-252642-20241102), who earned all three points thanks to a first-half header from [Alexander Isak](https://www.sportbible.com/alexander-isak).

On the subject of Isak, a number of clubs have expressed an interest in the Sweden international, including big-spenders [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea), who made an approach in the summer.

Advert

Newcastle rebuffed any approach and a price of at least £200 million was mentioned, according to the [**Northern Echo**](https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/24413025.newcastle-uniteds-alexander-isak-chelsea-response-amid-interest/), with the Magpies 'determined to do all they could' to keep Isak after his 23-goal contribution last season.

Arsenal have also been linked with the in-form striker. In fact, Manchester United's former chief scout Mick Brown has "heard whispers" of a possible move.

“He’d be an asset to any club in Europe,” Brown told [**Football Insider**](https://www.footballinsider247.com/alexander-isak-ive-heard-whispers-about-a-move-to-arsenal/). “I’ve heard whispers speaking about a potential move to Arsenal and that wouldn’t shock me.

"There are a few of the top clubs who have been keeping an eye on his situation. I think he’s getting a bit fed up at Newcastle and was expecting them to show a bit more ambition in the transfer window and with their results."

Brown added: “He might feel next summer is a good time for him to move on. That’s the way things are now, particularly if they don’t qualify for Champions League.”

The real reason for Edu's departure has been confirmed.
-------------------------------------------------------

#### **Following the departure of sporting director Edu, Arsenal fans have a theory of the real reason behind the key figure's exit.**

It was reported on Monday that Edu would be making the step down from his duties at [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) following the club's 1-0 loss to [Newcastle United.](https://www.sportbible.com/newcastle-united)

An official announcement from Arsenal is said to be planned in the next 24 hours.

It has since been announced by [David Ornstein](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5806690/2024/11/04/arsenal-edu-leaves-club/) that Edu is set to take on a brand new role at another [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) club once his exit from Arsenal is confirmed.

The report states Edu has agreed to join the group controlled by [Nottingham Forest](https://www.sportbible.com/nottingham-forest) owner Evangelos Marinakis, but the role he will take is still unconfirmed.

A source at [The Independant](https://x.com/MiguelDelaney) claims Marinakis is ready to 'triple' Edu's current salary and offer him the chance to become CEO, something he was unable to do at Arsenal.

Following the shock reports, Arsenal fans have shared some theories on the reason behind Edu's exit and it involves [Mikel Arteta.](https://www.sportbible.com/mikel-arteta)

Over the summer, a report from [The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/uk/) stated the Arsenal hierarchy weren't entirely convinced by the signings of [Riccardo Calafiori](https://www.sportbible.com/riccardo-calafiori) and Mikel Merino but Arteta pushed for their signatures.

David Ornstein also recently revealed Arteta has gained a lot of power at Arsenal, [stating](https://x.com/aliftbll/status/1852871853515178074): “As he’s grown in power at the club, it’s not easy to question him internally.”

With this in mind, [one X user](https://x.com/aliftbll/status/1853370315000152116) has suggested that Edu has grown sick of Arteta's antics and theorised the 'power struggle' over the summer was responsible for Arteta's new contract.

They wrote: "He didn’t agree to a new contract until after the window closed. I think he said get the players I want or I'm not signing."

![Image 2: Edu Arteta- Getty](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt61197f76edb27f52/6728e9322a4e33c4831245ed/GettyImages-2171497843.jpg)

Edu Arteta- Getty

Another fan replied: "Imagine issuing an ultimatum for Calafiori and Merino, please can we get a sporting director who will challenge Arteta."

A report from [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14038371/Edu-quitting-Arsenal-SAMI-MOKBEL-sporting-director.html) could back up these claims, as it revealed Edu's power had been 'diluted' in recent times.

Edu has a great relationship with Evangelos Marinakis, and a move to Forest could be expected shortly after confirmation of his exit from The Emirates.

In his first [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) match as interim manager of [United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united), [Ruud van Nistelrooy welcomed Chelsea to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/roy-keane-ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-utd-chelsea-514260-20241104)

Despite a penalty from [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.sportbible.com/bruno-fernandes) putting the hosts in the lead late in the match, the points were split after a goal from [Moises Caicedo](https://www.sportbible.com/moises-caicedo) equalised the match.

And after the match, former player and pundit [Scholes](https://www.sportbible.com/paul-scholes) has spoken out about one player for their lacklustre performance during the huge match.

Speaking after the game, the ex-midfielder criticised United winger [Marcus Rashford](https://www.sportbible.com/marcus-rashford) for his failure to capitalise on a chance presented to him at the end of the first half.

“I expect him to do better,” Scholes told [Premier League Productions](https://www.premierleague.com/matchweek/18399/blog) when reacting to a clip of the moment.

“I think he is trying to make the goal look better by going high into the roof of the net. It is quite a simple side-foot volley from seven yards.

“All he has to do is keep it down."

Had Rashford put away the chance, he would have opened the scoring and put the hosts ahead, potentially changing the outcome of the match.

Instead, it was Fernandes who scored the first goal as he put away a penalty after striker [Rasmus Hojlund](https://www.sportbible.com/rasmus-hojlund) was fouled in the box.

But just five minutes later, Chelsea midfielder Caicedo equalised with a powerful shot just outside of the box, locking the two sides in a stalemate until full-time.

In 10 Premier League matches, the Red Devils have found the back of the net just nine times, a concerning issue that Scholes argues must be addressed by new manager [Ruben Amorim.](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim)

“It is something the new manager has to address,” Scholes continued. “They have had chances this season. It has to get better.

“The lack of goals is a problem. We have one centre forward who we are not quite sure about. He \[Hojlund\] is a young lad but can get 20.25 goals? He looks more like a 10 to 15 man.

“Zirkzee who they brought in for over £30million hasn’t got up and running yet. Where are the rest of the goals coming from?

"So the biggest job he \[Amorim\] has is to find 70-80 goals to elevate them to where they should be.”

Damning Cole Palmer stat emerges after Man Utd draw as fans all ask the same question about Chelsea star
========================================================================================================

Fans have the same concern.

#### Fans have all raised the same question following Cole Palmer's performance in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford.

[Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) had to settle for a point at Old Trafford, as they came from behind against [Ruud van Nistelrooy's](https://www.sportbible.com/ruud-van-nistelrooy) United side.

[United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united) broke the deadlock in the second half from the penalty spot thanks to [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.sportbible.com/bruno-fernandes), but United held the lead for just four minutes as [Moises Caicedo'](https://www.sportbible.com/moises-caicedo)s volley levelled the scores.

Advert

The point puts Chelsea ahead of [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) as they sit fourth in the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league), whilst United move up to 13th as they look to bounce back from their worst-ever start.

One player who didn't have the impact expected was [Cole Palmer](https://www.sportbible.com/cole-palmer), who has so often been the difference between three and one point for [Enzo Maresca.](https://www.sportbible.com/enzo-maresca)

Following the match, a rather [damning stat](https://x.com/yakobper90/status/1853143668812550264) surrounding the [England](https://www.sportbible.com/england) star emerged, as his lack of return against United give him just two non-penalty goals against the top six in 13 games for Chelsea.

Advert

Palmer has scored 29 Premier League goals since making the move from the Etihad in 2023, but his killer instinct has often evaded him against the League's big boys.

Given his recent form, many fans have made the argument that Palmer is the best player in the league, with his four-goal haul against Brighton a particularly stand-out performance.

![Image 3: Cole Palmer- Getty](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt7273f3dc89da12ff/6728afd57b474c290998cdf6/GettyImages-2182697188.jpg)

However, given his record against the traditional top-six fans on social media have begun to question whether Palmer is at that level.

Advert

One fan commented: "Like 70% of his goal contributions this season came from just 2 out of 10 games. Statpadder."

A Chelsea fan fired back: "He got man of the match against United Arsenal and City since last season stop begging it and basing everything based on goals."

A second replied: "Wouldn’t lace Salah's boots."

Another comment read: "I’m happy you’re calling it out cos I don’t entertain these convos waste of time."

Updated 11:29 4 Nov 2024 GMTPublished 10:44 4 Nov 2024 GMT

The Sky Sports pundit didn't hold back.
---------------------------------------

**Manchester United legend Gary Neville has hit out at two players from his former club following their disappointing draw to Chelsea in the Premier League.**

On Sunday, [United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united) welcomed [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) to Old Trafford for the first Premier League match [with interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy in charge.](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/roy-keane-ruud-van-nistelrooy-man-utd-chelsea-514260-20241104)

Despite taking the lead late in the match through a penalty scored by captain [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.sportbible.com/bruno-fernandes), United allowed Chelsea back into the game as Moises Caicedo equalised five minutes later, [leading to a full-time score of 1-1.](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/man-utd-chelsea-premier-league-ruben-amorim-582620-20241103)

And after the match, former player and [Sky Sports](https://www.sportbible.com/sky-sports) pundit [Gary Neville](https://www.sportbible.com/gary-neville) spoke about United's performance in the match, and he called out two players in particular for their lack of effort during the game.

Speaking after the match on [The Gary Neville podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSGxltAgxeU), the pundit said: "I’m not going to dig Rashford and Garnacho out but I am…

"They are two players who have come through the ranks and with that comes some credit. The fact you’re an academy player, you get a level of buy-in from the fans because of that, there’s a level of enthusiasm towards then.

"But when I watch Saka, Trossard and Martinelli for Arsenal, Silva and Foden for Man City, or I watch players at Liverpool… I watch them all scurrying back and harassing players and doubling back.

"I’ve watched \[Malo\] Gusto run forward there in the first half, we couldn’t believe how much space he got.

"The first ethic is you’ve got to work hard. I’m not saying Rashford and Garnacho don’t work hard but they could work harder, I know that."

Neville explained that during his time at United, there was an expectation on all players in the team to do their defensive duties, even forwards, and it is clear that [Marcus Rashford](https://www.sportbible.com/marcus-rashford) and [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.sportbible.com/alejandro-garnacho) were not prepared to do that on Sunday.

"When I played, the defensive work the players in those positions put in resulted in rewards at the other end of the pitch. The harder you work the luckier you get," he added.

"They think they’re working hard and applying themselves but we’ve got to get back to the idea that you’re all in it together.

"I’ve got to point towards Garnacho and Rashford today and say they can do a lot more off the ball. I’m not interested in what they can do on the ball. I’m interested in the spirit to fight for the team all the way through the match.

"I’m not saying they did badly today but I watch the other wide players in the league do a lot more than them."

Key Mikel Arteta ally set to leave Arsenal in major blow days after Newcastle defeat
====================================================================================

A huge blow for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta.
-----------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Ryan Smart](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=96&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt73e6c63a94b68964/6346a0a78eaeb10f480f6633/PSFix_20200526_204156.jpeg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/ryan-smart)[Ryan Smart](http://www.sportbible.com/author/ryan-smart)

**Arsenal have announced the shock departure of a senior figure at the club just days after their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle.**

The Gunners failed to have a single shot on target after Alexander Isak's first half header put the Magpies in front at St James' Park.

It was an uncharacteristic performance for [Mikel Arteta](https://www.sportbible.com/mikel-arteta)'s side in that sense, and they are now already seven points behind Premier League leaders [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) after 10 games.

And the Gunners have now been given a fresh blow, with sporting director and key Arteta ally Edu set to leave the club in a surprise move.

The reason behind his departure is said to be unclear at this stage, although the Daily Mail report that [it is the Brazilian's own decision](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14037425/Arsenal-sporting-director-Edu-LEAVING-club-major-blow-Mikel-Arteta-loses-key-ally-masterminded-transformation-signed-Martin-Odegaard-Declan-Rice.html) to leave the club following talks with the senior hierarchy.

An official announcement is said to be planned in the next 24 hours.

Advert

Edu re-joined [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) in 2019, having been part of their Invincibles squad as a player, and is seen as a key factor behind the comprehensive changes brought in at the Emirates Stadium.

Perhaps more significantly, he has a strong relationship with Arteta, having played a role in his appointment as manager in December 2019.

Speaking of his working relationship with Edu in 2022, Arteta [commented](https://www.arsenal.com/news/every-word-mikels-pre-psv-press-conference-0): "I hope that he stays here for a long time, because I think it's going to be a really positive thing for the club.

"I've worked with him really well, and I think he's a super important figure at the club that represents all of the values and ideas that we want to take the right way, and hopefully that will be the case.

"There is a lot happening at a football club and he has a huge role. He has a really good way of communicating with people and managing a lot of things that happen daily, so for me and for the team he's really important."

PGMOL issue statement explaining why Lisandro Martinez wasn’t sent off for lunge on Cole Palmer
===============================================================================================

It was one of the big talking points from Sunday's game between Man Utd and Chelsea.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Jack Kenmare](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=96&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltf01b4d12f956d167/61151c77961af910ebfb9107/WDSSq4y6.jpeg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)[Jack Kenmare](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)

**The PGMOL – the refereeing body of English football – has explained why Lisandro Martinez avoided a red card for his challenge on Cole Palmer during Sunday's clash between Manchester United and Chelsea.**

A rare moment of quality from Moises Caicedo cancelled out Bruno Fernandes' penalty as visitors [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) secured a hard-fought point to climb above Arsenal in the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) table.

It was a far-from-memorable game in Manchester but one of the big talking points came in stoppage time, when referee Robert Jones was met with an awkward decision to make.

Advert

With a minute remaining, United defender [Lisandro Martinez](https://www.sportbible.com/lisandro-martinez) caught [Cole Palmer](https://www.sportbible.com/cole-palmer) on the knee with his studs high. VAR Michael Salisbury proceeded to review the incident but to the surprise of many, he did not upgrade the booking to a red.

After the incident, the [**Premier League Match Centre**](https://x.com/PLMatchCentre) released a statement on the incident.

"The referee issued a yellow card to Martinez for a challenge on Palmer," they said. "VAR checked for a potential red card and confirmed the referee’s call of no red card, deeming that it was a reckless challenge and not serious foul play."

Roy Keane, meanwhile, said Martinez was "very lucky" to stay on the pitch.

Here's how fans on social media reacted to Martinez's challenge on Palmer.

Advert

One said: "How did Lisandro Martínez escape a red card here? The inconsistency in this league is baffling," while another wrote: "How did he get away with it?"

A third commented: "Lisandro Martínez’s biggest asset as a player: Avoiding red cards that in literally any other scenario would be a straight expulsion."

A fourth wrote: "Lisandro Martínez should've been shown a straight red," and a fifth added: "It’s the same as Bruno’s against Spurs that wasn’t a red now all of a sudden they’re campaigning for it to be a red."

Thoughts on the incident? Should Martinez have seen red? Let us know in the comments.

Man Utd fans want Ruben Amorim to make immediate change to the team after watching Chelsea game
===============================================================================================

Amorim will join United on November 11.
---------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Jack Kenmare](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=96&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltf01b4d12f956d167/61151c77961af910ebfb9107/WDSSq4y6.jpeg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)[Jack Kenmare](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)

**Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was inundated with advice regarding team selection during Sunday afternoon's Premier League clash against Chelsea.**

The 39-year-old, who has signed a contract until June 2027, with the option of a further year, will take charge of his first [United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united) game against Ipswich Town on Sunday, November 24.

He will, however, take charge of the club on Monday, November 11, which means he will get a decent chunk of time on the Carrington training pitch before this month's four-hour trip to Portman Road.

Advert

Based on players he has managed in the past, the Portuguese coach is expected to give former [Sporting Lisbon](https://www.sportbible.com/sporting-lisbon) midfielder Manuel Ugarte more first-team minutes.

Ugarte, who established himself as one of the Europe's best defensive midfielders under Amorim [before joining PSG in 2023](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/psg-manuel-ugarte-man-utd-contract-premier-league-134470-20240827), has failed to hit the ground running since his big-money move in the summer.

Bu he is familiar with Amorim's preferred 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1 system.

With all that being said, fans think his midfield partnership with Casemiro is lacking after the pair started Sunday's clash against Chelsea on Sunday afternoon

Advert

Here's how fans on social media reacted during the game.

One fan wrote: "An Ugarte-Casemiro double pivot gotta be one of the worst combos you can have in possession."

Another said: "This pivot of [Casemiro](https://www.sportbible.com/casemiro) and Ugarte is going to take years of my life. So bad," while a third commented: "Midfield pairing of Casemiro and Ugarte is horrendous."

A fourth wrote: "A midfield of Ugarte and Casemiro is criminal," and a fifth added: "The trio of Bruno-Casemiro-Ugarte is where ball retention doesn't exist. Shocking passing even in short distances from Bruno now."

Advert

Somebody who is convinced by Ugarte is interim manager [Ruud van Nistelrooy](https://www.sportbible.com/ruud-van-nistelrooy), who was full of praise for the Uruguayan this week.

“I’m convinced about Manuel. He will be a great player for United," said van Nistelrooy. “He has very specific qualities where he gets in between players and recovers a lot of balls to get us into attacking positions."

![Image 3: Image credit: Getty ](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt93f60497380f5a5d/6727bee802b878371277e1d7/GettyImages-2182026068.jpg)

Image credit: Getty

Van Nistelrooy added that United will have to rely on Ugarte more in the coming weeks as [Kobbie Mainoo](https://www.sportbible.com/kobbie-mainoo) and Mason Mount recover from injury.

Advert

"The recruitment is not part of the assistant manager but I can comment on working with Manuel on a daily basis," the Dutchman added. "He’s adjusting, he wants to adjust, he wants to be part of this club, do well and he’s very motivated to do so.

"He’s getting better every time. We are very thin in midfield, the coming games, we’re going to definitely need him and I think he’ll do well in the coming games."

Roy Keane identifies the 'big problem' that Ruben Amorim must solve at Man Utd
==============================================================================

Amorim has got plenty of work to do when he officially joins United on November 11.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ruben Amorim will encounter a "big problem" when he takes charge of Manchester United, according to Roy Keane, who has delivered a scathing assessment of "a few players" in the current team.**

After days of intense speculation, it was confirmed on Friday that [Amorim will succeed Erik ten Hag as the next Manchester United head coach](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/man-utd-ruben-amorim-manager-186278-20241029) following four trophy-laden years at Sporting Lisbon.

The 39-year-old, who has signed a contract until June 2027, with the option of a further year, will take charge of his first game at Ipswich Town on November 24.

He will, however, take charge of the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) club on Monday, November 11 – just a day after Sporting's trip to Braga.

Amorim has quite the job on his hands after United's lacklustre start to the 2024/25 campaign. In fact, [Roy Keane](https://www.sportbible.com/roy-keane) says the Portuguese coach will be met with not just one, but two "big" problems on his arrival.

Speaking to [**Sky Sports**](https://x.com/SkySportsPL) ahead of Sunday's game between [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/man-utd) and Chelsea, the former Republic of Ireland international criticised the work ethic of "a few players" in the United team – and said Amorim must act quickly to weed them out.

"There’s a few players in the United team in big positions who can’t run, which is a big problem," Keane began.

"But they also have players in the team who don’t want to run and when they do run they don’t run hard enough, fast enough, for long enough so he has to get that into the dressing room, that mentality. The players who aren’t doing it you have to try and move them on.

"This team doesn’t run, that’s a big problem. They’ve got really talented players but if you’re not going to run you’ll get nowhere fast."

He added: "This group of players don’t dig in, when the going gets tough they go under, they go under too easily."

Keane also brought up United's lack of firepower in forward areas. So far, they have managed just eight goals in nine league games.

"The lack of goals is a huge problem for Man United," he said. "Every time I read the league table, after nine or 10 games, minus three goals for Man United, it’s hard to read."

Do you agree with Keane? Let us know in the comments.

Liverpool have been linked with a move for a Premier League star.

**Liverpool have reportedly been offered a chance to sign a Premier League star.**

Dutchman Arne Slot has enjoyed a fine start to life at Anfield after replacing Jurgen Klopp in the summer.

Currently, the Reds sit top of the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) table, two points ahead of reigning champions Manchester City.

[Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) have also made a perfect start in the UEFA Champions League, having won all three matches so far.

Looking ahead to the transfer window, it has been claimed that Liverpool are interested in signing Wolverhampton Wanderers full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri.

As [reported](https://www.footballinsider247.com/wolves-could-accept-cut-price-liverpool-offer-for-ait-nouri-sources/) for Football Insider, the [Wolves](https://www.sportbible.com/wolverhampton-wanderers) left-back has been on Liverpool’s wish list for a while and could sign the 23-year-old in a cut-price deal.

Advert

The report stated: “The Reds have been monitoring the left-back since Jurgen Klopp’s final season at Anfield, with the Premier League giants seeing him as a potential long-term option.

“Arne Slot is currently not fully convinced by his left-back options, with the feeling being that he wants to bring in a younger player.”

![Image 3: Image](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/blt46a54ecd5caf65a7/67279b34893453f07861b69b/GettyImages-2180410527.jpg)

On Saturday afternoon, Liverpool had to dig deep to come from 1-0 down to beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-1, with Mohamed Salah scoring the winner.

Advert

Speaking after the match, [Slot](https://www.sportbible.com/arne-slot) said: “First of all, credit to Brighton the way they showed up over here. They showed a lot of composure, they were not afraid to play. They play out from the back really well. A lot of energy without the ball. And we didn’t show up at all, in every part of the game, maybe except for the set-pieces part.

“But for the rest we were not there, and if you face a very good team like Brighton it’s not enough to run once, twice or three times, you have to keep on running.”

He added: “So, we changed a bit of tactics but that had nothing to do with ball possession, that had nothing to do with us coming out stronger in the second half, it all had to do that the players showed a different attitude and different intensity.

“Therefore, I said a few things and we showed a few things, but it wasn’t that I was screaming or fuming around. It’s just making sure the players understand that this was not enough, and I think they felt it themselves as well.”

[Vinicius](https://www.sportbible.com/vinicius-jr) has dominated headlines this week after he surprisingly missed out on the [2024 Ballon d'Or](https://www.sportbible.com/ballon-dor/pages/1), with [Manchester City's Rodri claiming the award.](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-city/ballon-dor-rodri-vinicius-jr-jude-bellingham-stats-193873-20241029)

The Brazilian winger has been central to Madrid's success in recent years, winning 13 trophies including three [La Liga](https://www.sportbible.com/la-liga) titles and two [Champions Leagues.](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league)

But now, a new report has revealed that the 24-year-old has made a decision regarding his future at the club, as two [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) sides have registered their interest in securing his signature.

Under his current contract with the club, Vinicius is set to stay with Los Blancos until the summer of 2027, after he signed an extension to his deal in October 2023.

However, according to a report from [Revelo](https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.relevo.com%2Ffutbol%2Fliga-primera%2Fprimeros-contactos-renovacion-vinicius-meses-20241030010208-nt.html&h=AT0G2xY4mVOsNonpAOHRnLdzyfRUalCsKO-wIL5wJ3nDyeF8Ohp10nZlY9F1Yuai0nRxLzKwNOJ4hRS823Vh9DHzB3Sol_w_78pvhBif8p6c4Wp1w6OjS07ngaLWGAwyZYWe8ACkfnWrykukziva4eU9eomlEaSU-k0&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT16zQ3sz8uZHIlvLPtDh5cQN6DSnL87QHoqpZ9HkVJcjcikSEPrF4VkAoV_DHo9WkMhG84fbBq7eVQLP0AShVnlS4CfbDfbrprDWgm1VnDqOHI2_xucIkGPERafv3KWKpaQOezoj7yeKcM6RtSCDgMBVsfJI982XqLnVsduBM0860Bw0w) , despite offering the Brazilian several opportunities to sign a new, and likely improved, deal to extend his stay further, the forward has decided against entering into negotiations.

Vinicius is said to be happy with his current deal and, while he thanked the club when they showed interest over the summer, he would rather wait for the best possible moment if he is to sit down and extend his stay.

With the superstar already the highest paid player in the Madrid squad, with a reported wage of £333,000-per week, it perhaps comes as no surprise that he is happy to wait and assess his options in the future.

The news comes after a [report](https://www.relevo.com/futbol/mercado-fichajes/ases-manga-vinicius-renovar-real-20241031124030-nt.html) that claimed that Premier League giants [Manchester United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united) and [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea), plus French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint Germain, are all keeping their eyes on the ongoing situation.

Should they believe that a deal for the winger would be possible, they could be prepared to offer a huge transfer package to bring him to the club.

Another option for Vinicius would be a move to the Saudi Pro League who Revelo report have offered him the chance to become the world’s highest-paid player with a deal worth a staggering €1 billion over five seasons.

Ruud van Nistelrooy tells Man Utd players to follow 'golden rule' set by Sir Alex Ferguson ahead of Chelsea game
================================================================================================================

Ferguson made the demand of his squad throughout his 26-year spell in charge.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Jack Kenmare](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=96&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltf01b4d12f956d167/61151c77961af910ebfb9107/WDSSq4y6.jpeg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)[Jack Kenmare](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jack-kenmare)

**Ruud van Nistelrooy has asked his Manchester United players to live by a rule that Sir Alex Ferguson "demanded" during his 26-year reign in charge.**

Van Nistelrooy, who took charge on an interim basis after [Erik ten Hag was sacked on Monday](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/erik-ten-hag-man-utd-sack-premier-league-024134-20241028), will remain in the Old Trafford hot seat for games against Chelsea, PAOK and Leicester before Ruben Amorim takes over on November 11.

The Dutchman started his interim spell with a 5-2 win over Leicester in the Carabao Cup but Sunday's much-anticipated [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league) clash against [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) will no doubt be his toughest test to date.

Advert

Ahead of the clash, [Van Nistelrooy](https://www.sportbible.com/ruud-van-nistelrooy) has urged his team to embrace the culture that [Sir Alex Ferguson](https://www.sportbible.com/sir-alex-ferguson) engrained in each and every one of his players.

"Ferguson said, 'No one is bigger than the club,'" said Van Nistelrooy, as quoted by the [**Daily Mail**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14034973/Ruud-van-Nistelrooy-Man-United-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-Chelsea-Ruben-Amorim.html). "Anyone can shout it. But if you then, as Ferguson did, give substance to your own words with every decision, every choice, it becomes different. Then players know, 'This is how it works here.'"

He continued: "Take the interaction with supporters. Always thanking people after a game, good or bad. Or at hotels where we come and where there are fans. Just handing out an autograph. Take a photo.

"Ferguson demanded us at the time to take time for that. I'm back there myself now. And I encourage it in players. Do I think it's an example of an important cultural thing? Yes. He is present at every home game. That's when we run into each other.

"He also came to watch Rangers when I coached PSV Eindhoven in Glasgow in the [Champions League](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league) in 2022. I really appreciated that. Ferguson also openly states how nice it is that I am back. How good he thinks that is. That's nice.

"This man has coloured a very important part of my football life. I was able to achieve my achievements at United partly because of him. He motivated, inspired, guided me through that period."

After the Leicester game on Wednesday night, Van Nistelrooy discussed his future after [Ruben Amorim](https://www.sportbible.com/ruben-amorim) agreed to succeed [Erik ten Hag](https://www.sportbible.com/erik-ten-hag) as the permanent manager of Manchester United.

“Of course," he told Sky Sports when asked if he was open to staying. "I came here as an assistant to help the club. Now in this role, I’m helping as long as needed. In the future in any capacity, I’m here to help the club further to build towards the future that’s what I'm here for.”

Van Nistelrooy reiterated his desire to work under the next manager. “I’m here to help and serve and give my everything for the club in any capacity with so many people here around me that want the best for the club and that will never change," he added.

Steven Gerrard tried to convince two players to sign for Liverpool over text message and they rejected him instantly
====================================================================================================================

Gerrard failed to convince two footballing stars to join Liverpool.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Steven Gerrard once tried to convince two players to join Liverpool by text message - but was instantly rejected.**

Gerrard spent his the majority of his career as a [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) player, despite an attempt from [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) to sign him in 2005.

He had been made captain in 2003 by then manager Gerard Houllier, and kept the role for 12 years.

Advert

As a result, [Gerrard](https://www.sportbible.com/steven-gerrard) marshalled Liverpool throughout numerous eras at Anfield, and lifted the [Champions League](https://www.sportbible.com/champions-league) final in 2005 before reaching the final again two years later.

And the former captain also had an occasional hand in helping to convince players to move to Liverpool, given his standing at the club. But it didn't always work out.

In his 2015 autobiography, 'My Story', Gerrard revealed that he had actually had an 'unofficial role' at the club in which he persuaded players to join the Reds - but missed out on two players in particular after they turned him down.

Advert

He wrote: "I had an unofficial role at the club, trying to persuade some great players to join Liverpool.

"In 2013, the latest player in our sights was Willian, the Brazilian midfielder. I followed the usual routine when approaching a star player we wanted to sign.

"Instead of calling him directly I always sent a text. It seemed more respectful and allowed the player to read my message at a time when it suited him best.

"I slipped into the groove with William. I said hello and hoped he didn't mind me contacting him directly, I stressed how much I admired him as a player.

Advert

"And then, having mentioned that I knew Liverpool were speaking to his agent, I used the standard line: 'If you need to chat or ask any questions I'm available at any time'.

"However, he replied with: 'I'm not sure Liverpool can win me the Champions League'."

Later in the book, he also explained: "We \[Gerrard and then manager Brendan Rodgers\] both admired Toni Kroos immensely.

Advert

"I knew Real Madrid were gearing up to make Bayern Munich an offer and so I felt a bit awkward when I texted Kroos.

"The German was on his way to winning the World Cup with his country and Real were the champions of Europe. But God loves a tirier, and so I gave it a whirl."

Willian would eventually join Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, having turned down moves to both Liverpool and [Tottenham](https://www.sportbible.com/tottenham-hotspur).

After a spell at Arsenal, the Brazilian spent the previous two seasons at Fulham before moving to Galatasaray in the summer.

Advert

Kroos, meanwhile, joined [Real Madrid](https://www.sportbible.com/real-madrid) in 2014 and spent a decade at the Bernabeu before retiring from professional football following Euro 2024 with Germany. He won five Champions League titles while with Real.

“The German was on his way to winning the [World Cup](https://www.sportbible.com/world-cup) with his country and Real were the champions of Europe. But God loves a trier, and so I gave it a whirl.”

Sir Jim Ratcliffe makes brutal comments about the Man Utd squad during interview and fans are in disbelief
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He made the comments after watching INEOS Britannia lose against Emirates Team New Zealand in the Americas Cup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sir Jim Ratcliffe made a comparison between football and sailing after INEOS Britannia lost against Emirates Team New Zealand in the Americas Cup – and it doesn't reflect well on the current Manchester United squad.**

The 71-year-old British businessman, who is the founder and majority owner of INEOS – one of the world's largest chemical producers – [acquired a 25 per cent stake in Manchester United in February for a fee of around £1.3 billion](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/man-utd-sir-jim-ratcliffe-premier-league-623931-20240118).

Ratcliffe and his team assumed total control of football operations at Old Trafford as they signalled their intent to implement a new structure with the hire of Omar Berrada as chief executive.

But after spending more than £200 million on five new signings in the summer window, [United](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-united) have made a dismal start to the 2024/25 campaign, winning just three games out of a possible nine in the [Premier League](https://www.sportbible.com/premier-league).

Ruben Amorim has plenty of work to do when he arrives on November 11, the day after their home game against Leicester City. In fact, Ratcliffe himself has appeared to suggest that he is not entirely happy with the current squad.

Speaking after INEOS Britannia lost against Emirates Team New Zealand in the Americas Cup, the United co-owner pointed out a parallel between what he'd just seen to Manchester United.

Here's how the conversation played out.

**Reporter**: "Is there was anything you can take away from this campaign in sailing to Manchester United?"

**Ratcliffe**: “I think there’s one little crossover, which is that you cannot win the Americas Cup unless you arrive at the Americas Cup with a boat that 'could' win the Americas Cup.

“It's the same in Formula One. [Max Verstappen](https://www.sportbible.com/max-verstappen) in a Williams, he’s not going to win the [Formula One](https://www.sportbible.com/formula-one) Championship. With football it’s the same with the squad in a way. That’s the parallel for me – you can’t win anything in football if your squad isn’t good enough to win something. The quality of the squad is a bit like the speed of the boat. That’s the only parallel.”

Here's how fans on social media reacted to Ratcliffe's comments.

One said: "If this is not a wake up of all wake up calls to this squad then they are thicker than I thought. When the owner of [@ManUtd](https://x.com/ManUtd)'s footballing side of things comes out with this statement, you're on thin ice."

A second wrote: "Tears, he had to take a deep breath before he answered," while a third commented: "Can't get much more damning than that."

A fourth said: "Yeah we are cleaning house again next season. I love it," and a fifth added: "SJR hates the squad man."

Thoughts on Ratcliffe's comments? Do you agree? Let us know in the comments.

Premier League club ready to make stunning move for Aurelien Tchouameni in January after he was 'transfer listed' by Real Madrid
================================================================================================================================

Tchouameni could be playing in the Premier League in January.

**A Premier League club is reportedly preparing to make a stunning bid for Aurelien Tchouameni in January with Real Madrid willing to sell him.**

The France international joined [Real](https://sportbible.com/real-madrid) in the summer of 2022, later admitting that he turned down an offer from [Liverpool](https://sportbible.com/liverpool) to move to Madrid instead.

He reached the [World Cup](https://sportbible.com/world-cup) final with France in 2022 and was part of the Real squad that won the [Champions League](https://sportbible.com/champions-league) last season.

However, he suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the semi-final of the latter competition against Bayern Munich, missing the final as a result.

This season, he has been a regular starter for Real in all competitions, but Los Blancos have had a poor start to the season under Carlo Ancelotti.

They suffered a 4-0 humiliation at the hands of El Clasico rivals Barcelona in the Bernabeu earlier this month, and and lost to French side Lille in the Champions League.

Advert

According to reports, Real are willing to part company with the midfielder to fund other high-profile transfers, despite handing him a six-year contract when he arrived in Spain.

And TEAMtalk [now claim](https://www.teamtalk.com/liverpool/hopes-grow-dream-real-madrid-raid-transfer-record) that Liverpool are exploring the possibility of going back in for Tchouameni, with manager Arne Slot said to be keen on bringing him to Merseyside.

The Reds were adamant in the summer that Martin Zubimendi was their only target for the defensive midfield role - an area the club are clearly keen to strengthen in.

Once the Spaniard turned down a move, Liverpool kept faith in what they already had the club, though it is unclear if Tchouameni was ever a realistic alternative at the time.

Advert

Now, they could return for a player who [Jurgen Klopp](https://www.sportbible.com/jurgen-klopp) wanted to sign in his penultimate summer transfer window as Liverpool boss - as part of what is now a new era for the current table-topping side.

Jamie Carragher breaks the internet with social media post after Liverpool win and Man City and Arsenal both lose
=================================================================================================================

It was not a good day of Premier League action for Arsenal and Manchester City, which made Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher very happy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Jakob Barnes](http://www.sportbible.com/_next/static/media/sportbible.188d1f0d.svg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jakob-barnes)[Jakob Barnes](http://www.sportbible.com/author/jakob-barnes)

**We may be just ten games in to the new Premier League campaign, but the title race is hotting up already. This weekend, Liverpool were the main beneficiaries on a surprising matchday that involved surprising defeats for Manchester City and Arsenal, much to the delight of Jamie Carragher.**

Going into the weekend, [Man City](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-city) were top of the table, with [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) close behind, and [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal) further back in third place. Many had expected that to remain the same by the end of the weekend, but things have not quite gone to plan.

With both City and the Gunners dropping points, Liverpool have jumped to the top of the pile thanks to a win over Brighton, continuing the brilliant start to the season under new manager Arne Slot.

Arsenal had the chance to close the gap, at least temporarily, with the early kick-off away at Newcastle United. But, Mikel Arteta's side put in a toothless and limp performance at St. James' Park and registered their second defeat of the season, with an Alexander Isak header in the first half proving enough to win the game for the Magpies.

Meanwhile, in the 3pm kick-offs, Manchester City travelled to the Vitality Stadium to take on Bournemouth. Pep Guardiola's men were behind after just nine minutes, and their disadvantage was doubled just after the hour-mark. A late goal from Josko Gvardiol could only serve as a consolation in the end as City suffered their first league defeat of the 2024/25 campaign.

Those defeats, twinned with Liverpool's thrilling comeback, were enough to put [Carragher](https://www.sportbible.com/jamie-carragher) in an especially good mood. The pundit took to X/Twitter to share a clip from a previous CBS Champions League broadcast, where he comically delivers the line, "What a matchday this was."

The show is far more casual than your normal football broadcast, and Carragher has offered up plenty of meme-worthy moments during his time with CBS already. Now, his latest viral post has hit over 360,000 views at the time of writing, and has fans of all three clubs flooding the comments.

Advert

There is still a long way to go this season, of course, but for now at least, Liverpool hold the advantage with a two-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.

However, [Liverpool fans have already demanded Arne Slot replaces one player](https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/liverpool/liverpool-arsenal-arne-slot-premier-league-transfer-613378-20241027) if he is to maintain his challenge for the title this season.

Commentator aims brutal dig at Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta previously called 'best in class'
===========================================================================================

Not what you'd expect to say the least...
-----------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Luke Alfred Davies](http://www.sportbible.com/_next/static/media/sportbible.188d1f0d.svg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/luke-alfred-davies)[Luke Alfred Davies](http://www.sportbible.com/author/luke-alfred-davies)

**A commentator aimed a brutal dig at one of Mikel Arteta's coaching team during the first half of Arsenal's match against Newcastle.**

Fans were clearly amused by the comment as they reacted to a video posted to X.

The commentator in question, Jon Champion, 59, is a voice that many supporters will be used to.

Advert

The Harrogate-born broadcaster previously narrated several high-profile matches as well as a period covering for legendary match commentator John Motson for BBC's flagship football programme Match of the Day.

But on Saturday afternoon, Champion aimed a jibe at [Arsenal](https://www.sportbible.com/arsenal)'s set-piece coach Nicolas Jover.

Jover, 43, has been part of the Gunners' staff since 2021, having previously worked at [Manchester City](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-city), Brentford and the Croatian national team.

Advert

"It’s amazing how quickly he retreats into the dugout when the set piece doesn’t go well,” said Champion.

Arsenal were 1-0 down at that point after [Alexander Isak](https://www.sportbible.com/football/transfer-news/arsenal-premier-league-mikel-arteta-523086-20241102) headed home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross to hand the home side the advantage on 12 minutes.

The Swede found space in between Arsenal's centre-backs [William Saliba](https://www.sportbible.com/william-saliba) and [Gabriel](https://www.sportbible.com/gabriel-magalhaes).

Presumably, Jover will analyse the goal and advise the Gunners' defenders of how do improve in similar situations.

Advert

Set-piece coaches seem to be a trend in the Premier League at the moment with most club's employing one in order to get that extra edge over their opponents on free-kicks and corners.

Arteta praised Jover when asked if he was the best in his field back in September.

“In his field, in other fields, as a person, the relationship that we have, that’s why I made a decision to bring him to City when I was there and then to Arsenal," Arteta explained.

“Him and the staff, they have injected the belief to the players that there are many ways to win football matches and that this is a really powerful one.

Advert

“He’s given us a lot, so big compliment to all of them.”

Fans weighed in with their verdict on Champion's comments.

One said: "Does he want him to run on the pitch and start doing cartwheels?"

Another added: "What else is he meant to do?"

Advert

With a third saying: "Obviously he's \[a\] coach."

Arsenal's new stance on move for Premier League star while contract talks 'remain open'
=======================================================================================

The Gunners may look to bolster their attacking options in future transfer windows.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Luke Alfred Davies](http://www.sportbible.com/_next/static/media/sportbible.188d1f0d.svg)](http://www.sportbible.com/author/luke-alfred-davies)[Luke Alfred Davies](http://www.sportbible.com/author/luke-alfred-davies)

**Arsenal were reportedly interested in signing a world-class striker from a Premier League rival, and now an update has emerged.**

[Mikel Arteta](https://www.sportbible.com/mikel-arteta)’s side have endured a tough start to the season after being hit by several injury blows, with captain [Martin Odegaard](https://www.sportbible.com/martin-odegaard) having been sidelined since early September.

To add rub salt in their wounds, red cards received by [Declan Rice](https://www.sportbible.com/declan-rice), Leandro Trossard, and [William Saliba](https://www.sportbible.com/william-saliba) further depleted Arteta’s options in recent weeks, but so far, the north London outfit have coped well given the challenging circumstances – they sit third in the league, trailing leaders [Manchester City](https://www.sportbible.com/manchester-city) by five points (before kick-off in today’s fixture against Newcastle).

Despite their healthy league position, one criticism thrown at Arsenal has been their lack of cutting-edge in the attacking areas.

Unlike their rivals Manchester City and Liverpool, who boast clinical goal scorers Erling Haaland and [Mohamed Salah](https://www.sportbible.com/mohamed-salah), the Gunners’ goals are spread throughout the side with Kai Havertz (four goals), Saka (three), with Gabriel, Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli (all with two goals) chipping in with strikes.

But they may still look to bring a forward if the right deal can be struck.

The Gunners were linked with the likes of RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Newcastle United forward Alexander Isak in the summer transfer window, but both players remain at their respective clubs. Ironically the latter scored an impressive header against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon after latching onto Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross.

Isak, 25, is under contract at the Magpies until 2028, but he is concerned about the direction the club are heading in, according to [Football Insider](https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-arsenals-updated-stance-on-signing-alexander-isak-revealed/).

The report also suggests that talks are ongoing between the Swedish international’s representatives and the club regarding a potential new deal on Tyneside.

The former Real Sociedad marksman has struggled with injuries so far this term, scoring just twice in eight appearances, but he will be hoping to replicate his form from last season - which saw him net 21 times in the Premier League.

The forward previously addressed his situation, insisting he was “happy” at Newcastle in July 2024.

“I had my best season of my career, \[in 2023-24\],” Isak told Swedish outlet [Fotbollskanalen](https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/).

“You can’t underestimate that. I love everything about the club, the fans, the city,” he said.

“I don’t really have any toughts of moving \[club\] or anything like that. I’m having a great time, and I’m very happy with my life.

“It’s \[a transfer\] not something I speculate about. Within the team or the club, there has been no talk or drama around it. I have not received any information from the club that they would have to sell me.”

Title: Liverpool players feel Mo Salah 'disrespected' key teammate as stunning dressing room details come to light

Markdown Content:
**Liverpool star Mohamed Salah was once ‘disrespectful’ to one of his teammates – and the Reds' players were not happy.**

[Salah](https://www.sportbible.com/mohamed-salah), 32, has etched himself into the history book at Anfield, with his 219 goals for the club helping the Reds to several trophies - including the 2019 Champions League and 2020 Premier League title.

The Egyptian’s success on Merseyside coincided with [Jurgen Klopp](https://www.sportbible.com/jurgen-klopp)’s tenure at the club with the German signing Salah from Roma in 2017.

From the outside, Salah is seen as a pleasant family man who is a consummate professional acting as a role model to young footballers around the world.

However, in December 2020, the former [Chelsea](https://www.sportbible.com/chelsea) man was interviewed by two reports from Spanish outlet [AS](https://en.as.com/soccer/).

The player answered several questions from the reporters, but one particular revelation did not go down well with the [Liverpool](https://www.sportbible.com/liverpool) dressing room at the time.

Salah admitted he was disappointed by the fact he was not named as captain for a Champions League tie away at Midtjylland.

Klopp named a much-changed side, but Salah was one of the stars still involved, scoring in the first minute of the game.

However, then-22-year-old [Trent Alexander-Arnold](https://www.sportbible.com/trent-alexander-arnold) wore the captain’s armband in Denmark, to the dismay of his teammate.

“Honestly, I was very disappointed,” admitted Salah.

“I was hoping to be the captain, but it's a coach's decision. I accept it.”

Salah also voiced his admiration for Real Madrid and Barcelona during the interview, which was seen as an attempt to “connect himself” with Spanish fans - according to a report in the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14030741/truth-Mohamed-Salah-Jurgen-Klopp-uneasy-marriage-Liverpool.html), adapted from [Chasing Salah: The Biography](https://books.mailshop.co.uk/chasing-salah-9781408721155/) by Simon Hughes.

The report also suggests that several members of the Liverpool dressing room felt Salah’s comments were disrespectful towards Alexander-Arnold.

The interview was posted online ahead of the Reds’ trip to face Crystal Palace – a game which Salah was benched for.

Many Liverpool players saw this as Klopp’s way of showing Salah who the boss was.

It is said that members of Liverpool’s backroom team believe that Klopp and Salah’s relationship changed as a result of the player’s comments.

There are also suggestions that Salah did not take to Klopp’s ‘father figure’ approach during his Liverpool tenure as the 32-year-old did not see a manager as someone who needed to develop him as a person.

Of course, the pair’s most recent public disagreement came during Liverpool’s 2-2 draw away against West Ham in April 2024.

Salah and Klopp were seen engaging in what appeared to be a heated exchange before he replaced Luis Diaz on the 79-minute mark.

Tensions had not cooled after the full-time whistle as the Liverpool man addressed reporters waiting in the mixed zone at the London Stadium.

"If I speak, there will be fire,” said Salah.

“Fire?” a reporter replied.

“Yes, of course,” Salah answered.

However, Klopp insisted that the ill-feeling was “done” after the pair spoke in the dressing room.

In years to come, this will simply be a footnote connected to Klopp and Salah’s time together at the club.

Fans will remember the goals, and trophies, cherishing the memories the pair created rather than their alleged distant relationship.

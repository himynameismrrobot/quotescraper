    After a turbulent week ended in a 1-1 draw with [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea), the latest episode of BBC Radio Manchester's The Devils' Advocate has landed to dissect it all.
    
    In this week's show, Gaz Drinkwater and Joe McGrath discuss the Old Trafford draw with the Blues, caretaker boss Ruud van Nistelrooy and captain Bruno Fernandes' comments about former manager Erik ten Hag.

    Sporting boss Ruben Amorim says Manchester United fans may think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on Tuesday.
    
    The 39-year-old has two more games as Sporting boss before taking over at Old Trafford - including the Champions League match against his new team's city rivals.
    
    "If the result is very negative, expectations will drop and I don't think that's a bad starting point, when you begin at Manchester United," he said in his pre-match news conference.
    
    "If we win, they'll think the new Sir Alex Ferguson has arrived, which is very difficult to maintain.
    
    "I'm fully aware that I'm going to be judged as a manager on this game, and only on this game, and I realise what people can take from this depending on the result."
    
    Ferguson won 38 trophies during 26 years as Manchester United boss before retiring in 2013. He is leaving his role as club ambassador at the end of the season.
    
    Sporting have won 14 of their past 15 games in all competitions, only losing the Portuguese Super Cup this season.

    With a delayed flight and queues to get through security at Lisbon airport, I was in a rush and a bit flustered when I arrived at the press conference room for Sporting's pre-match media for their Champions League game against [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city).
    
    I didn't realise until I had sat down that I was only one - empty - seat away from Ruben Amorim, who was watching one of his players answering questions.
    
    I said hello and shook Amorim's hand. He said hello back and seemed perfectly civil.
    
    Then, after answering 20 minutes of questions in his native Portuguese, Amorim was asked another five or six by the English media.
    
    Again, the answers were in Portuguese. Asked by an English TV journalist if he could offer an answer in English, he declined. His press officer said English journalists would get a lot of answers in their native tongue when he starts officially at Manchester United on 11 November.
    
    For now, it is Portuguese only.
    
5.  ![Image 5: Noussair Mazraoui in action for Manchester United](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/2023/live/fec48780-9ab7-11ef-b676-1939a5bc8521.jpg.webp)Image source, Getty Images
    
    Full-back Noussair Mazraoui believes Manchester United "have too much" quality to be where they are in the table.
    
    In a week that saw Erik ten Hag sacked as manager and assistant Ruud van Nistelrooy stepping up to take caretaker charge, United ended it with a 1-1 draw against rivals [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) at Old Trafford.
    
    The Red Devils sit 13th in the Premier League table with just three victories and 12 points, recording their worst points haul after 10 matches since 1986-87.
    
    However, Mazaroui feels the team deserved more at the weekend and their current position does not reflect where they should be.
    
    "We fought really hard, but I think eventually if you look at the game and the chances we created, we deserve to win," he told MUTV.
    
    "I think if you look at the table where we are now, you cannot say that's where we belong. Everybody knows that. We know that.
    
    "We have to step up and get away from there really, really fast because, yeah, that's just not us.
    
    "You see that \[against Chelsea\]. We have too much of a quality to be there in this position."
    
    Van Nistelrooy shared a similar view to the Morocco international, saying the Chelsea draw and Carabao Cup win against [Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) showed a foundation of "spirit and fight" that means "football qualities will come out" at United.
    
    But Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca believes the Dutchman's side overstepped the mark late on in the game, when he felt Lisandro Martinez should have been sent off for a challenge on Cole Palmer.
    
    Asked if the match was at times too physical, Mazraoui said: "I don't agree. No, no, not too physical. I think it was really passionate from both sides.
    
    "I think for the supporters a great game to watch, even though there were just two goals in there. I think an amazing game to watch from everybody."

    We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Manchester United and Chelsea.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Man Utd fans:**
    
    **Ray:** Poor team performance. Thought there would be a bounce from the players with Ten Hag gone but more of the same - no cohesion between defence, midfield and forwards.
    
    **Andrew:** I pity our new manager - we are a complete shambles. Clueless. Playing for fouls and appealing to the ref is all we are good at. Worst I have ever witnessed in 58 years.
    
    **Adam:** It was a solid performance, but the lack of goals is becoming a concern now. United are six points off the top four but, in reality, we are nowhere near the teams above us in terms of an identity and style of play.
    
    **Christine:** It was a little better but still a team with no identity as such. It is going to take Amorim some time to sort out this mess. The defence is too leaky and the press is not fast enough. These players are not good enough and it's going to take time to change this team.
    
    **Chelsea fans:**
    
    **John:** It's a pity that we sent Petrovic out on loan. He is a good goalkeeper, and unfortunately Sanchez is going to prove very costly for us this season. Hopefully we can accumulate enough points to get top four without a quality keeper. Caicedo is immense for us at the minute - he's quality.
    
    **Alan:** Largely dull and boring. If the manager is happy with this performance then I would be surprised. We just do not know how to get the ball in the net. When pushed, our defence falls to bits. From previous games, we seemed to go backwards with our progress. At times, it was hard to believe we are in the top six playing against a team in the lower half.
    
    **Nick:** A decent performance without being exciting. We didn't seem to offer much of a threat in the final third. Satisfied with a point after going a goal down. Feeling positive about the remainder of the season. I think fourth place is achievable.
    
    **Stu:** I thought we were off it. Considering these players haven't played in a week they just didn't convince. Sanchez is the worst goalkeeper we've ever had. He's costing us goals almost every game and yet Maresca won't replace him. Says it all really.

    On Sunday's episode of Match of the Day 2, former England internationals Phil Jones and Danny Murphy looked at captain Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United and where he fits in when new head coach Ruben Amorim takes charge later this month.
    
    Fernandes' former United team-mate Jones said: "I get the impression he's almost misinterpreted at times, I can only go from my own experience in the dressing room that I spent with him.
    
    "He's a leader in the dressing room and he's brilliant with the younger lads. We've all got different captains and he's a leader who leads by example, in terms of the qualities he brings. He's a player that you build the team around.
    
    "He wants to win. Being at Manchester United is a heavy shirt to wear and I feel with him being the captain, he can certainly wear that shirt."
    
    Assessing his performance in Sunday's 1-1 draw against Chelsea, Murphy said: "No United player has really been outstanding this season, that's fair enough to say, and Bruno included - he's admitted it himself more or less.
    
    "But when they need somebody to be brave and creative, he stands up to be counted and again he did \[against Chelsea\].
    
    "Nearly all of the moments when United open up teams, he's involved somewhere. It doesn't matter what the score is, how big the crowd is, whether they're moaning or happy, he's always trying little things.
    
    "When the new man comes in, irrelevant of system or how he wants to play, he'll have to find a place for Fernandes because he is United's best creative spark."

    Former Manchester United manager David Moyes and ex-Premier League midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker have spoken to the BBC's Football Daily podcast about United's two performances under interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy since the exit of Erik ten Hag.
    
    **Reo-Coker:** "Even though it's only been two games, I see a vast improvement from what we saw from the players' performances under Ten Hag. They are running more, they're showing a greater desire to win.
    
    "Even just the body language, the way Ruud embraces the players after the game and the players with him, that tells you a bigger, deeper story than just a feelgood factor right now."
    
    **Moyes:** "I come from another side of it - I think it would be wrong of the players if they just suddenly put in a couple of good performances for the new manager. It would tell you more about the players than the manager they've just lost.
    
    "United have had some of the best managers in the world recently, like Van Gaal and Mourinho, Ten Hag had a great record as well. I think United were very loyal to Erik and gave him every opportunity to get it right. But I'd hate the thought that the players are suddenly starting to perform better because somebody else has taken over.
    
    "At United, the scrutiny is incredible and the manager takes the brunt of it, which they do at all football clubs, but at a club like United the players are an important part of it. I hope that the players have just stepped it up in the past week or two but it was nothing to do with the manager."
    
    **Reo-Coker:** "Ruud hasn't really changed anything tremendously, which is why you'd say it probably is on the players. He's still started in the same formation Ten Hag was playing, but it's just a different appetite that the players are showing.
    
    "It's unfortunate because United were very loyal to Ten Hag, but since the change has happened, you can see a different kind of energy in the players. Nothing has changed much in terms of formation and tactics."

    ![Image 17: Alejandro Garnacho of Manchester United reacts to a missed chance during the Premier League match between Manchester United FC and Chelsea FC at Old Trafford](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/44c4/live/035e9b90-9a14-11ef-9852-95dc1d6e0bb6.jpg.webp)Image source, Getty Images
    
    Alejandro Garnacho is Manchester United's highest goalscorer this season with six.
    
    But it should be many more.
    
    The Argentina wide-man had at least four clear cut chances against [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) - and wasted the lot.
    
    There are echoes of Cristiano Ronaldo's early days at Old Trafford before something clicked in the summer of 2006 and he returned more focused and started finding the net on a regular basis.
    
    I am not expecting Garnacho to get close to Ronaldo in terms of overall output but he can do better - and he needs to.
    
    At the moment, he is one of the reasons why United are struggling to score.

    **Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy spoke to BBC Sport after today's draw:** "Overall it was a very good performance. The players did really well and fought in every inch of the pitch. It was very good to watch that bit.
    
    "The chances we created, we could have scored one more to win the game. It was a shame we couldn't. Overall I'm slightly disappointed we didn't win.
    
    **On his job:** "It's an emotional rollercoaster - it's been almost a full week where so many things happened. My job was to steady the ship. The players reacted very well, something to build on in the next two games.
    
    "I came here to help the club in any capacity. After these two games that will continue and hopefully it can work out.
    
    "It's special to be back in the city and at the club. I really enjoy every single minute of it.
    
    "I try to share the culture of the club, the culture of the town and the fans. That's an important part. I'm glad I can share these moments and help the players understand the spirit.
    
    "I saw the spirit on the pitch on Wednesday and today. That's the foundation to grow."

    **Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been speaking to BBC Sport after today's draw:** "Everyone knows how much I wanted the goal to come. I need to help the team with goals and assists. It's been one of the most disappointing things this season - but I got some in the cup. Now scoring in the Premier League.
    
    "It was a lot of disappointment in the dressing room. We could have won the game."
    
    **On what has changed after Ten Hag:** "Not much has changed. In midweek the goals went in. I said to some friends everything will come to us and people will say we wanted the manager to be sacked. We get the point and we can be happy for that. We need to be disappointed because we're far back in the league."
    
    **On Ruud van Nistelrooy:** "Ruud is a nice guy, humble for someone who won everything at the club."
    
    **On incoming boss Ruben Amorim:** "I am a big fan of Sporting and watch a lot of their games. Ruben Amorim brought the excitement back to the club - it was a little bit split when he came \[to Sporting\]. He transformed everything and brought everyone together."

    Sporting boss Ruben Amorim says Manchester United fans may think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on Tuesday.
    
    The 39-year-old has two more games as Sporting boss before taking over at Old Trafford - including the Champions League match against his new team's city rivals.
    
    "If the result is very negative, expectations will drop and I don't think that's a bad starting point, when you begin at Manchester United," he said in his pre-match news conference.
    
    "If we win, they'll think the new Sir Alex Ferguson has arrived, which is very difficult to maintain.
    
    "I'm fully aware that I'm going to be judged as a manager on this game, and only on this game, and I realise what people can take from this depending on the result."
    
    Ferguson won 38 trophies during 26 years as Manchester United boss before retiring in 2013. He is leaving his role as club ambassador at the end of the season.
    
    Sporting have won 14 of their past 15 games in all competitions, only losing the Portuguese Super Cup this season.

    With a delayed flight and queues to get through security at Lisbon airport, I was in a rush and a bit flustered when I arrived at the press conference room for Sporting's pre-match media for their Champions League game against [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city).
    
    I didn't realise until I had sat down that I was only one - empty - seat away from Ruben Amorim, who was watching one of his players answering questions.
    
    I said hello and shook Amorim's hand. He said hello back and seemed perfectly civil.
    
    Then, after answering 20 minutes of questions in his native Portuguese, Amorim was asked another five or six by the English media.
    
    Again, the answers were in Portuguese. Asked by an English TV journalist if he could offer an answer in English, he declined. His press officer said English journalists would get a lot of answers in their native tongue when he starts officially at Manchester United on 11 November.
    
    For now, it is Portuguese only.
    
5.  ![Image 5: Noussair Mazraoui in action for Manchester United](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/2023/live/fec48780-9ab7-11ef-b676-1939a5bc8521.jpg.webp)Image source, Getty Images
    
    Full-back Noussair Mazraoui believes Manchester United "have too much" quality to be where they are in the table.
    
    In a week that saw Erik ten Hag sacked as manager and assistant Ruud van Nistelrooy stepping up to take caretaker charge, United ended it with a 1-1 draw against rivals [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) at Old Trafford.
    
    The Red Devils sit 13th in the Premier League table with just three victories and 12 points, recording their worst points haul after 10 matches since 1986-87.
    
    However, Mazaroui feels the team deserved more at the weekend and their current position does not reflect where they should be.
    
    "We fought really hard, but I think eventually if you look at the game and the chances we created, we deserve to win," he told MUTV.
    
    "I think if you look at the table where we are now, you cannot say that's where we belong. Everybody knows that. We know that.
    
    "We have to step up and get away from there really, really fast because, yeah, that's just not us.
    
    "You see that \[against Chelsea\]. We have too much of a quality to be there in this position."
    
    Van Nistelrooy shared a similar view to the Morocco international, saying the Chelsea draw and Carabao Cup win against [Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) showed a foundation of "spirit and fight" that means "football qualities will come out" at United.
    
    But Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca believes the Dutchman's side overstepped the mark late on in the game, when he felt Lisandro Martinez should have been sent off for a challenge on Cole Palmer.
    
    Asked if the match was at times too physical, Mazraoui said: "I don't agree. No, no, not too physical. I think it was really passionate from both sides.
    
    "I think for the supporters a great game to watch, even though there were just two goals in there. I think an amazing game to watch from everybody."

    We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Manchester United and Chelsea.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Man Utd fans:**
    
    **Ray:** Poor team performance. Thought there would be a bounce from the players with Ten Hag gone but more of the same - no cohesion between defence, midfield and forwards.
    
    **Andrew:** I pity our new manager - we are a complete shambles. Clueless. Playing for fouls and appealing to the ref is all we are good at. Worst I have ever witnessed in 58 years.
    
    **Adam:** It was a solid performance, but the lack of goals is becoming a concern now. United are six points off the top four but, in reality, we are nowhere near the teams above us in terms of an identity and style of play.
    
    **Christine:** It was a little better but still a team with no identity as such. It is going to take Amorim some time to sort out this mess. The defence is too leaky and the press is not fast enough. These players are not good enough and it's going to take time to change this team.
    
    **Chelsea fans:**
    
    **John:** It's a pity that we sent Petrovic out on loan. He is a good goalkeeper, and unfortunately Sanchez is going to prove very costly for us this season. Hopefully we can accumulate enough points to get top four without a quality keeper. Caicedo is immense for us at the minute - he's quality.
    
    **Alan:** Largely dull and boring. If the manager is happy with this performance then I would be surprised. We just do not know how to get the ball in the net. When pushed, our defence falls to bits. From previous games, we seemed to go backwards with our progress. At times, it was hard to believe we are in the top six playing against a team in the lower half.
    
    **Nick:** A decent performance without being exciting. We didn't seem to offer much of a threat in the final third. Satisfied with a point after going a goal down. Feeling positive about the remainder of the season. I think fourth place is achievable.
    
    **Stu:** I thought we were off it. Considering these players haven't played in a week they just didn't convince. Sanchez is the worst goalkeeper we've ever had. He's costing us goals almost every game and yet Maresca won't replace him. Says it all really.

    On Sunday's episode of Match of the Day 2, former England internationals Phil Jones and Danny Murphy looked at captain Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United and where he fits in when new head coach Ruben Amorim takes charge later this month.
    
    Fernandes' former United team-mate Jones said: "I get the impression he's almost misinterpreted at times, I can only go from my own experience in the dressing room that I spent with him.
    
    "He's a leader in the dressing room and he's brilliant with the younger lads. We've all got different captains and he's a leader who leads by example, in terms of the qualities he brings. He's a player that you build the team around.
    
    "He wants to win. Being at Manchester United is a heavy shirt to wear and I feel with him being the captain, he can certainly wear that shirt."
    
    Assessing his performance in Sunday's 1-1 draw against Chelsea, Murphy said: "No United player has really been outstanding this season, that's fair enough to say, and Bruno included - he's admitted it himself more or less.
    
    "But when they need somebody to be brave and creative, he stands up to be counted and again he did \[against Chelsea\].
    
    "Nearly all of the moments when United open up teams, he's involved somewhere. It doesn't matter what the score is, how big the crowd is, whether they're moaning or happy, he's always trying little things.
    
    "When the new man comes in, irrelevant of system or how he wants to play, he'll have to find a place for Fernandes because he is United's best creative spark."

    Former Manchester United manager David Moyes and ex-Premier League midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker have spoken to the BBC's Football Daily podcast about United's two performances under interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy since the exit of Erik ten Hag.
    
    **Reo-Coker:** "Even though it's only been two games, I see a vast improvement from what we saw from the players' performances under Ten Hag. They are running more, they're showing a greater desire to win.
    
    "Even just the body language, the way Ruud embraces the players after the game and the players with him, that tells you a bigger, deeper story than just a feelgood factor right now."
    
    **Moyes:** "I come from another side of it - I think it would be wrong of the players if they just suddenly put in a couple of good performances for the new manager. It would tell you more about the players than the manager they've just lost.
    
    "United have had some of the best managers in the world recently, like Van Gaal and Mourinho, Ten Hag had a great record as well. I think United were very loyal to Erik and gave him every opportunity to get it right. But I'd hate the thought that the players are suddenly starting to perform better because somebody else has taken over.
    
    "At United, the scrutiny is incredible and the manager takes the brunt of it, which they do at all football clubs, but at a club like United the players are an important part of it. I hope that the players have just stepped it up in the past week or two but it was nothing to do with the manager."
    
    **Reo-Coker:** "Ruud hasn't really changed anything tremendously, which is why you'd say it probably is on the players. He's still started in the same formation Ten Hag was playing, but it's just a different appetite that the players are showing.
    
    "It's unfortunate because United were very loyal to Ten Hag, but since the change has happened, you can see a different kind of energy in the players. Nothing has changed much in terms of formation and tactics."

    Alejandro Garnacho is Manchester United's highest goalscorer this season with six.
    
    But it should be many more.
    
    The Argentina wide-man had at least four clear cut chances against [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) - and wasted the lot.
    
    There are echoes of Cristiano Ronaldo's early days at Old Trafford before something clicked in the summer of 2006 and he returned more focused and started finding the net on a regular basis.
    
    I am not expecting Garnacho to get close to Ronaldo in terms of overall output but he can do better - and he needs to.
    
    At the moment, he is one of the reasons why United are struggling to score.

    **Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy spoke to BBC Sport after today's draw:** "Overall it was a very good performance. The players did really well and fought in every inch of the pitch. It was very good to watch that bit.
    
    "The chances we created, we could have scored one more to win the game. It was a shame we couldn't. Overall I'm slightly disappointed we didn't win.
    
    **On his job:** "It's an emotional rollercoaster - it's been almost a full week where so many things happened. My job was to steady the ship. The players reacted very well, something to build on in the next two games.
    
    "I came here to help the club in any capacity. After these two games that will continue and hopefully it can work out.
    
    "It's special to be back in the city and at the club. I really enjoy every single minute of it.
    
    "I try to share the culture of the club, the culture of the town and the fans. That's an important part. I'm glad I can share these moments and help the players understand the spirit.
    
    "I saw the spirit on the pitch on Wednesday and today. That's the foundation to grow."

    **Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been speaking to BBC Sport after today's draw:** "Everyone knows how much I wanted the goal to come. I need to help the team with goals and assists. It's been one of the most disappointing things this season - but I got some in the cup. Now scoring in the Premier League.
    
    "It was a lot of disappointment in the dressing room. We could have won the game."
    
    **On what has changed after Ten Hag:** "Not much has changed. In midweek the goals went in. I said to some friends everything will come to us and people will say we wanted the manager to be sacked. We get the point and we can be happy for that. We need to be disappointed because we're far back in the league."
    
    **On Ruud van Nistelrooy:** "Ruud is a nice guy, humble for someone who won everything at the club."
    
    **On incoming boss Ruben Amorim:** "I am a big fan of Sporting and watch a lot of their games. Ruben Amorim brought the excitement back to the club - it was a little bit split when he came \[to Sporting\]. He transformed everything and brought everyone together."

    20:58 4 November
    
    **Simon Stone**  
    Chief football news reporter in Lisbon
    
    Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken to the media before Tuesday's Champions League game at Sporting (20:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the main lines from his news conference:
    
    *   On losing two games in a row: "I know our standards. We lost one game in the Premier League. Maybe we will lose against [Brighton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-and-hove-albion) and [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) \[next two league fixtures\], but we lost one game and we are two points behind a top-class team in [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool). I know people expect us to win 38 games 5-0 and the Treble every season because this is our standards - but this will not happen."
        
    *   On a season of struggle: "We have to accept we are going to struggle and it is fine. Every game will be more difficult than when everything was smooth. We won six Premier Leagues in seven years and situations change. It's the reality. The middle class in the Premier League rise unbelievably. The top-class teams were always there - add [Newcastle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united) and Tottenham, but after you see [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham), [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford), most of the teams."
        
    *   On Erling Haaland's fitness and whether he needs a break: "He's fine, no problem. We have to occupy the news 24 hours a day. I don't think he needs a break."
        
    *   On Ruben Amorim's Sporting: "The pattern is clear. Movements in behind are so dangerous - the pace and the control. Good inside, good switch of players and movement. Winning the Portuguese leagues after 20 years and then doing it again shows how good the job he has done here."

    Sporting boss Ruben Amorim says Manchester United fans may think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on Tuesday.
    
    The 39-year-old has two more games as Sporting boss before taking over at Old Trafford - including the Champions League match against his new team's city rivals.
    
    "If the result is very negative, expectations will drop and I don't think that's a bad starting point, when you begin at Manchester United," he said in his pre-match news conference.
    
    "If we win, they'll think the new Sir Alex Ferguson has arrived, which is very difficult to maintain.
    
    "I'm fully aware that I'm going to be judged as a manager on this game, and only on this game, and I realise what people can take from this depending on the result."
    
    Ferguson won 38 trophies during 26 years as Manchester United boss before retiring in 2013. He is leaving his role as club ambassador at the end of the season.
    
    Sporting have won 14 of their past 15 games in all competitions, only losing the Portuguese Super Cup this season.

    *   Manchester City's Erling Haaland has been directly involved in 49 goals in 42 appearances in the Champions League (44 goals, five assists). If he scores or assists on Tuesday, the 24-year-old will become the player to reach 50 goal involvements in the fewest games in the competition's history - a record currently held by former [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy (45).

    We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Manchester City.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Bournemouth fans:**
    
    **Rob:** A monkey off our back with the City win! Can you really now say, "it was an off day for City" and also, "an off day" in the Arsenal game? And... were Villa also having an "off day"? I think Bournemouth deserve more credit. Up the Cherries.
    
    **Steve:** A tremendous performance from the Cherries. Iraola’s tactics were played out to perfection and rather than go for the low block many teams use against City, Cherries played their natural attacking game and took it to the champions from the first minute. Still buzzing 24 hours later. Europa Conference spot could be in reach.
    
    **Derek:** Another great performance, seven points from three top teams. As seems to be often the case the result is portrayed as being due to top team being off par rather than Bournemouth playing well and taking the game to the opposition. Iraola has instilled a belief and collective teamwork that does not give up and works from start to finish. Joy to watch.
    
    **Peter:** A historic win. I think we knew as fans that we can beat anyone at home. We have to keep hold of Semenyo and Kerkez. Evanilson is fitting in well. I hope the last three games give the team the belief that they can challenge in the top half of the table. Iraola is a magician!
    
    **Man City fans:**
    
    **Suraj:** Very disappointing, don’t understand why the performance was so flat. I know we’ve got injuries, but we still had a strong side. Not sure why more were not used, maybe Pep’s worried about more injuries. Liverpool I think are the ones to look out for as unlike us they came back from behind. I'm just not feeling confident for this season.
    
    **Abdullah:** City were off it today. Until Jeremy Doku came on we were actually horrendous and were shown how to play. Doku and Gvardiol our only positive players. Semenyo and Kerkez were outstanding and fair play to Evanilson, who converted his sole chance (something we couldn't do). You can't control injuries but we will bounce back soon, we always do.
    
    **Steve:** A lacklustre performance from us, proven by the fact it was the 80th minute for our first shot on goal to arrive. After four consecutive titles, I am not convinced we have the same hunger we had in previous seasons. One positive out of the game was another excellent performance by Nunes. Congrats to Bournemouth, who thoroughly deserved the win.
    
    **Roger:** City have been fragile defensively all season and combined with an aging midfield and several players all striving to find their best form this defeat was long overdue. Pep will no doubt turn it round but possibly might need to use some fringe players to achieve it.

    All good things must come to an end.
    
    Manchester City's 32-match unbeaten run in the Premier League is over after a lacklustre performance at in-form Bournemouth.
    
    After Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat Tottenham, Pep Guardiola bemoaned having just 13 fit players, but he was still able to name a strong eleven to face Bournemouth - Erling Haaland, Ederson, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva featured from the start.
    
    But it just did not click for the Premier League champions, who were unbeaten across their previous 21 fixtures against Bournemouth, and the busy calendar might be just starting to catch up with them.
    
    Conceding early was far from ideal with Antoine Semenyo putting the hosts in front after nine minutes and the half ended with Bournemouth fans chanting "ole" following every completed pass.
    
    City were carved open when the Cherries doubled their lead through Evanilson and it took until the 80th minute for the visitors to register an attempt on target, albeit a tame one from Erling Haaland.
    
    They did half the deficit two minutes later through Josko Gvardiol, who scored his sixth goal in seven away Premier League games.
    
    Haaland thought he had grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time but Mark Travers saved and the Norwegian's follow-up struck the post.
    
    Losing is not something City are accustomed to - it is the first time they have lost successive games across all competitions since September 2023 and the first time they have tasted defeat in the league since December 2023.
    
    A trip to Porto, managed by incoming Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, is next up for City in the Champions League on Tuesday.

    **Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day after today's loss:** "We knew we couldn't match the intensity. We have talked about it. It was an open game. We had chances at the end but I congratulate Bournemouth for the victory.
    
    "The 50-50 balls in the middle, the duels, they play this type of game. They are so aggressive. They had six-seven days to prepare. They have physicality and speed, but you have to win these types of situations. And they had chances. Ederson made a good save. We had real good moments at the start of the second half and after that it was difficult to swallow as we were good. After we scored we had momentum and chances but couldn't score \[again\]."
    
    **On injuries and fitness issues:** "It is what it is. We have few players with a lot of minutes and a lot of players with no minutes to the balance is a bit uncomfortable. We played good against Spurs but today we could not handle their intensity that they had and that's why we lost the game."

    Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches this season, against a variety of guests.
    
    For week 10, he takes on The Piano TV series winner Brad Kella.
    
    **Sutton's prediction: 1-2**
    
    This is another hard one to call. Manchester City's performances just haven't been there of late, but they are still finding a way to beat teams every week and I'm not sure what's going to be different this time.
    
    I don't think this is going to be easy for City, who are missing a few players though injury, but you have to remember how good they are at getting over the line in games like this.
    
    So, although I'm backing Bournemouth to score, I still expect City to edge this one.
    
    [Southampton,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) [Wolves](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/wolverhampton-wanderers) and [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) have all run the champions close recently, and all of them still lost. It could be the same story for the Cherries too.
    
    They are likely to be a lot more ambitious than Saints were at Etihad Stadium and that could suit City.
    
    Bournemouth are a team who get plenty of shots off and we saw what they did to [Arsenal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal) a couple of weeks ago, but that will leave more space for Pep Guardiola's side.
    
    **Brad's prediction: 2-1**
    
    I want a Bournemouth win and I think they can get one. Rodri has been a massive loss for Manchester City since he got injured and they have got a few other players out too.

    Speaking on a new episode of You'll Never Beat Kyle Walker on BBC Sounds, the Manchester City captain paid tribute to City team-mate and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri.
    
    "For him, it's absolutely fantastic," said the England full-back. "I think he's been nothing short of probably perfect in the last couple of seasons. You can see what he means to Man City.
    
    "I think this season we've adapted very well without him but in the last couple of seasons when he's not really been there, we've not really been the same Man City. The goals that he's scored, the assists that he's provided, it's not really a defensive midfielder.
    
    "'Gundo' \[Ilkay Gundogan\] said something in a post someone sent me and for a defensive player to get that award, for us defensive-minded players it means a little bit more.
    
    "If you look at the last 10-15 years, you've got Messi and Ronaldo without a shadow of a doubt, then Luka's \[Modric\] got it and then Benzema. It's recognition for the work that he's putting in without getting the headlines."

    As soon as Pep Guardiola answered my opening question at Friday's press conference with "you'll see tomorrow", I got the sense the Manchester City boss was not going to be too forthcoming about his side's injury issues.
    
    Part of it will be to keep Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola guessing over who will be in the City side at Vitality Stadium, but part will also be because he is waiting to discover exactly who is available and for how long.
    
    Guardiola accepted it is not unusual for clubs to suffer a long injury list. He also knows what a negative impact it can have.
    
    He mentioned Liverpool. In 2022-23 Jurgen Klopp's men in the end did well to finish fifth, with 67 points, a year after they had finished second with 92.
    
    That is the scenario Guardiola will be anxious to avoid this season.
    
    City are top. But you get the sense if they win a fifth Premier League title in a row, he would regard this one as the best.

    Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against [Bournemouth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/afc-bournemouth) (kick-off 15:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the key lines from his news conference:
    
    *   Savinho could be available for Saturday's trip to Vitality Stadium as it was "just a strong knock" he suffered against [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) and "no fracture".
        
    *   Guardiola says he "has many doubts" about who else could recover in time and he will "talk to players and the doctors" on Saturday morning.
        
    *   He said "we are in an emergency in certain positions" but the academy players are there to support and he trusts them.
        
    *   More on City's growing injury list: "It is what it is. It happens in many clubs and we're not the only club in the world to be going through it."
        
    *   Guardiola said he has told the players to "not feel sorry for ourselves".
        
    *   He said "the squad is enough when completely focused and fit" in response to whether he will look to bring players in during the January transfer window.
        
    *   On whether a conversation needs to be had about the football calendar and its toll on players' health: "We know it \[is too many games\], but it is the reality. We try to take care of them. We’ve not done anything differently to previous seasons. If anything we’ve trained less. But it happens and you have to adapt."

    The decision to allow Manchester City's stoppage-time winner against Wolves on 20 October has been backed by an independent panel.
    
    [John Stones' header was eventually awarded](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c93yv0xewzpt) following a pitchside review by referee Chris Kavanagh after it had initially been disallowed for offside, with Bernardo Silva standing close to Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.
    
    The Key Match Incident panel, which reviews the big decisions from every Premier League game, unanimously agreed with the VAR intervention, saying Silva was "not clearly in the line of the goalkeeper's vision or impacting his ability to make a save".
    
    During the game, the [Premier League Match Centre posted on X:, external](https://x.com/PLMatchCentre/status/1848017633133613354) "Stones' goal was disallowed on-field due to Bernardo Silva being in an offside position and in the goalkeeper's line of vision. The VAR deemed Bernardo Silva wasn't in the line of vision and had no impact on the goalkeeper and recommended an on-field review. The referee overturned his original decision and a goal was awarded."
    
    That weekend's fixtures - the eighth round of Premier League matches - saw multiple VAR reviews with penalties overturned and yellow cards upgraded to reds.
    
    In October, referees' chief Howard Webb said there had [been an 80% reduction](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgmgrljderro) in the number of video assistant referee (VAR) errors this season compared to 2023-24.

    Manchester City defender Callum Doyle has played all but around five minutes of Norwich City's Championship season so far, and that tells its own story.
    
    It is fair to say he has been a revelation for the team - beginning the campaign as a central defender but moving to left-back in more recent weeks. The highlight was a brilliant goal against Watford in a 4-1 win at Carrow Road.
    
    He already has more than 90 games under his belt in the second tier following loan spells at [Leicester,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) Coventry and Sunderland and, at the age of 21, he looks very comfortable in the division. Doyle is also a regular for England Under-21s.
    
    The Canaries' new Danish head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup likes his full-backs to cover a lot of ground and join in with central midfield positions when needed. Doyle has been the perfect player for the job.
    
    He is strong on the ball and plays with energy and a clear toughness that goes a long way in the hustle and bustle of the Championship. Sometimes his eagerness to get forward does have the potential to leave defensive areas exposed, but Norwich fans are quick to applaud his gut-busting runs to get back into position.
    
    The Carrow Road faithful are already dreaming of a permanent move for his services but it is clear he is a player who is destined for the Premier League, one way or another.

    Chelsea defender Levi Colwill feels the side "deserve to win most games" after a frustrating draw with [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united).
    
    The Blues missed the chance to go third in the Premier League table and close the gap on table-toppers [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) after coming away with a 1-1 draw from Old Trafford on Sunday.
    
    Despite the result, the young Chelsea side have still made an impressive start to life under new boss Enzo Maresca, sitting fourth in the table above last season's title challengers [Arsenal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal) and with a 100% record in the league phase of the Conference League.
    
    "I think the team are very frustrated," Colwill said after the match.
    
    "Where we are in the season, the football we've been playing, like today at times, we deserve to win most games.
    
    "I want to win every game so I was bit disappointed that we didn't. It was obviously a tough one out there and they had threats and that's how they scored.
    
    "We know what we're building, we know how good we are, how good we can be and how good we've been this season.
    
    "At times in this game we played good football, created good chances, but if you don't take the chances it keeps them in the game and they get a sniff. That's what happened."

    We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Manchester United and Chelsea.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Man Utd fans:**
    
    **Ray:** Poor team performance. Thought there would be a bounce from the players with Ten Hag gone but more of the same - no cohesion between defence, midfield and forwards.
    
    **Andrew:** I pity our new manager - we are a complete shambles. Clueless. Playing for fouls and appealing to the ref is all we are good at. Worst I have ever witnessed in 58 years.
    
    **Adam:** It was a solid performance, but the lack of goals is becoming a concern now. United are six points off the top four but, in reality, we are nowhere near the teams above us in terms of an identity and style of play.
    
    **Christine:** It was a little better but still a team with no identity as such. It is going to take Amorim some time to sort out this mess. The defence is too leaky and the press is not fast enough. These players are not good enough and it's going to take time to change this team.
    
    **Chelsea fans:**
    
    **John:** It's a pity that we sent Petrovic out on loan. He is a good goalkeeper, and unfortunately Sanchez is going to prove very costly for us this season. Hopefully we can accumulate enough points to get top four without a quality keeper. Caicedo is immense for us at the minute - he's quality.
    
    **Alan:** Largely dull and boring. If the manager is happy with this performance then I would be surprised. We just do not know how to get the ball in the net. When pushed, our defence falls to bits. From previous games, we seemed to go backwards with our progress. At times, it was hard to believe we are in the top six playing against a team in the lower half.
    
    **Nick:** A decent performance without being exciting. We didn't seem to offer much of a threat in the final third. Satisfied with a point after going a goal down. Feeling positive about the remainder of the season. I think fourth place is achievable.
    
    **Stu:** I thought we were off it. Considering these players haven't played in a week they just didn't convince. Sanchez is the worst goalkeeper we've ever had. He's costing us goals almost every game and yet Maresca won't replace him. Says it all really.

    Much of the talk around Chelsea in pre-season was how Enzo Maresca would find the right balance on the field when selecting from a large first-team squad, however, only four clubs have made fewer changes to their starting XI in the Premier League this season than the Blues (14).
    
    On Sunday's episode of Match of the Day 2, which analysed the draw with Manchester United, ex-England midfielder Danny Murphy said: "You build relationships and an understanding with players, where they're going to be and sometimes without even looking.
    
    "The two midfielders \[Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia\] were excellent but, all over the pitch, they seem to be settled.
    
    "It has been nice to see Reece James back as well. You forget what a wonderful talent he is, he's so comfortable on the ball."
    
    On Chelsea's midfield pairing, former Manchester United defender Phil Jones added: "A big part of a manager's job is to have that close relationship with the players and be someone that they can resonate with. Under Maresca, those two are blossoming."

7.  **Simon Stone**  
    Chief football news reporter
    
    ![Image 11: Enzo Maresca, Manager of Chelsea, speaks to Moises Caicedo at the end of the Premier League match between Manchester United FC and Chelsea FC at Old Trafford](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/7a00/live/83ea0ad0-9a1c-11ef-9852-95dc1d6e0bb6.jpg.webp)Image source, Getty Images
    
    Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca says 'one plus one doesn't equal two' when it comes to Moises Caicedo.
    
    He also feels the Ecuador midfielder has not been helped by the £115m fee that Chelsea have paid for him.
    
    The reality is Caicedo has, at times, looked a shadow of the player who excelled at [Brighton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-and-hove-albion), and justified the Seagulls holding out for such a huge sum amid strong interest from [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool).
    
    Caicedo caught the eye at Old Trafford thanks to his well-taken equaliser.
    
    But, there was much more to like about his performance.
    
    The old energy was there, his game intelligence and where he needed to be to cover [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) attacks and the simplicity with which he finds team-mates with short passes.
    
    As Maresca pointed out, supporters cannot expect the Caicedo to be the player he was at Brighton. He is operating in a different team, with different expectations.
    
    But we are seeing the talent on a regular basis now.

    **Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca spoke to BBC Sport after today's game:** "We knew it was a difficult game for many reasons. We scored, we came back. After the goal we tried to win.
    
    "We are happy because we knew how difficult it would be.
    
    "The \[United\] players want to prove they're good enough. A new manager with different ideas so we had to prepare a different way."
    
    **On his half-time change when he brought on Marc Cucurella for Malo Gusto:** "It was quite clear. We tried something different tactically. Not an injury for Malo \[Gusto\], just a tactical decision."

    **Chelsea scorer Moises Caicedo speaking to BBC Sport after today's draw:** "It was the chance to score a goal. I did it. I'm so happy. We knew if we waited for a long time \[to equalise\] it was going to be complicated. I'm so happy to equalise.
    
    "We deserved to win. We knew it would be a tough game but we were prepared for it. I'm so happy for the team. It was a great fight."

    *   Eight of the last 13 meetings between Manchester United and Chelsea in the Premier League have ended level. This is also the fixture with the most total draws in the competition’s history (27).
        
    
    *   None of the last five managers taking charge of their first Premier League away game at Old Trafford have lost (W2 D3 – Iraola, Postecoglou, Kompany, Slot and Maresca); the longest run in the competition’s history.

    Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches this season, against a variety of guests.
    
    For week 10, he takes on The Piano TV series winner Brad Kella.
    
    **Sutton's prediction: 1-1**
    
    Ruud van Nistelrooy is in charge of Manchester United as interim boss and he enjoyed himself against [Leicester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) in the Carabao Cup in midweek.
    
    The Chelsea players will be well-rested because their team that lost to [Newcastle United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united) in the same competition on Wednesday was totally different to the side that beat the Magpies in the league on Sunday.
    
    But Newcastle did create chances against them last weekend and, when I saw [Chelsea against Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c1wnxgl4223t) recently, they were brave at Anfield too.
    
    I see Chelsea as being the superior team here and my head tells me they will win. But, if they are quite open again at Old Trafford, then that could suit Manchester United and let them get something.
    
    **Brad's prediction: 0-3**
    
    Chelsea have got this and I'm going for a Cole Palmer hat-trick. What a mistake it was by Pep Guardiola to sell him because he is just unbelievable.

    After a turbulent week, there will be a lot of unknowns when Manchester United and Chelsea face off in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Sunday.
    
    While they go head-to-head on the pitch, we have asked our fan writers for each club to go head-to-head off it.
    
    Each fan got to ask three questions to each other before the big game...

    ![Image 20: Split fan's voice graphic with Manchester United and Chelsea badges](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/a5bc/live/0e92cd70-96df-11ef-ba4d-5b04a90bcb33.jpg.webp)
    
    _Here is what our Manchester United fan writer Dale O'Donnell had to say in response to questions from our Chelsea contributor Ross Mooring._
    
    **How much of a bounce are you expecting following Erik ten Hag's departure?**
    
    Ruud van Nistelrooy's Reds showed fight and attacking flair on Wednesday against a weakened Leicester City side.
    
    People talk about a new manager bounce, but this is a step into the unknown, although the initial signs were good. Chelsea will be favourites at Old Trafford.
    
    **Other than Cole Palmer, which current Chelsea player would you most want to sign?**
    
    There is nobody outside of Palmer. Not after Mason Mount. Erik ten Hag brought him to Old Trafford for a sizeable fee and we are still none the wiser about his best role in the team.
    
    **Who in a red shirt is most likely to make a big difference on Sunday?**
    
    Alejandro Garnacho is United's biggest threat in attack and he is a player that can hurt any side in the Premier League.
    
    He has seven goal contributions this season and will be looking to add to that on Sunday.

    _Here is what our Chelsea fan writer Ross Mooring had to say in response to questions from our Manchester United contributor Dale O'Donnell._
    
    **Do you think Enzo Maresca needs to do extra homework on Manchester United now Erik ten Hag has been sacked?**
    
    While I am sure Maresca will be looking at the win over Leicester and Ruud van Nistelrooy's past games as manager, the Italian is still very much bedding in his own style of play at the club.
    
    He also has to be concerned that the Blues have only kept four clean sheets so far this season and none in the past seven games, in spite of some relatively easy fixtures in Europe and the league.
    
    **What are your thoughts on Jadon Sancho at Chelsea?**
    
    Sancho has started brightly in a Chelsea shirt, assisting in his first three games and offering something on the left flank that none of the other options at the club do.
    
    However, he was subbed off at half time of the defeat at Liverpool and has not featured since, partly due to illness. Not being allowed to play against his parent club regardless, I would expect Pedro Neto will start on the left wing with Mykhailo Mudryk the alternate option.
    
    **What are Chelsea's biggest strengths going into the game at Old Trafford?**
    
    It might seem too easy to simply say "Cole Palmer" but it is the truth. Since the moment he signed on deadline day last year, Palmer has played in the manner of club legends Eden Hazard and Gianfranco Zola and he scored more goals last season than either ever achieved in a blue shirt to boot.
    
    While both Moises Caicedo and Nicolas Jackson have added composure to their games this season and Englishmen Noni Madueke and Levi Colwill have improved too, it is Palmer who will constantly be occupying two or three Manchester United players at a time on Sunday.

    Earlier, we asked you to identify the former Chelsea player from their Premier League statistics playing for the club.
    
    The correct answer was Gary Cahill.
    
21.  **Nat Hayward**  
    BBC Sport journalist
    
    Chelsea boss Enzo Marseca has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) (16:30 GMT).
    
    Here are the key lines from his news conference:
    
    *   Maresca confirmed he has a full squad available to select from apart from Jadon Sancho who is ill but would have been ineligible to face his parent club anyway.
        
    *   He is looking forward to facing former team-mate Ruud Van Nistelrooy who will be in the United dugout on Sunday: "I didn't speak with Ruud. I will give him a big hug on Sunday before the game. Fantastic guy, humble, very professional. I shared with him time when he was already finished but even then you could see how good he was."
        
    *   He retains 100% confidence in Enzo Fernandez despite the £105m midfielder losing his starting place in the Premier League: "I still trust Enzo, there is no reason in the world I can lose confidence in him. I like to say that we don't have an A or B team. There are players that are fantastic but we don't have indispensable players."
        
    *   On finding balance in his midfield: "When we play with Enzo \[Fernandez\], it has to be Enzo and one between Moises \[Caicedo\]and Romeo \[Lavia\]. When Enzo moves we struggle in the middle with physicality. In this moment, Moises and Romeo give us this."
        
    *   On Nicolas Jackson's fine form: "We are very happy because Nico is helping us, not just in terms of numbers but in the way we want to play. The way he links with his team-mates is helping us in our process. When he drops he gives us an extra man. When he attacks in behind, he is quick and can score goals."
        
    *   Maresca does not believe his team rely on counter-attacks: "It's not for me whether we need to play slow or fast. It depends on the game. We have players in wide areas that can attack quick but I've said many times, the problem when you attack quick is they attack quick, then it becomes like against Newcastle - up and down."

    Real Madrid are willing to either pay £84m for Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez or offer the Blues their 24-year-old midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni as part of a deal to sign the 23-year-old Argentina international.

    20:58 4 November
    
    **Simon Stone**  
    Chief football news reporter in Lisbon
    
    Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has spoken to the media before Tuesday's Champions League game at Sporting (20:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the main lines from his news conference:
    
    *   On losing two games in a row: "I know our standards. We lost one game in the Premier League. Maybe we will lose against [Brighton](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-and-hove-albion) and [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) \[next two league fixtures\], but we lost one game and we are two points behind a top-class team in [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool). I know people expect us to win 38 games 5-0 and the Treble every season because this is our standards - but this will not happen."
        
    *   On a season of struggle: "We have to accept we are going to struggle and it is fine. Every game will be more difficult than when everything was smooth. We won six Premier Leagues in seven years and situations change. It's the reality. The middle class in the Premier League rise unbelievably. The top-class teams were always there - add [Newcastle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united) and Tottenham, but after you see [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham), [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford), most of the teams."
        
    *   On Erling Haaland's fitness and whether he needs a break: "He's fine, no problem. We have to occupy the news 24 hours a day. I don't think he needs a break."
        
    *   On Ruben Amorim's Sporting: "The pattern is clear. Movements in behind are so dangerous - the pace and the control. Good inside, good switch of players and movement. Winning the Portuguese leagues after 20 years and then doing it again shows how good the job he has done here."

    Sporting boss Ruben Amorim says Manchester United fans may think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat [Manchester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city) on Tuesday.
    
    The 39-year-old has two more games as Sporting boss before taking over at Old Trafford - including the Champions League match against his new team's city rivals.
    
    "If the result is very negative, expectations will drop and I don't think that's a bad starting point, when you begin at Manchester United," he said in his pre-match news conference.
    
    "If we win, they'll think the new Sir Alex Ferguson has arrived, which is very difficult to maintain.
    
    "I'm fully aware that I'm going to be judged as a manager on this game, and only on this game, and I realise what people can take from this depending on the result."
    
    Ferguson won 38 trophies during 26 years as Manchester United boss before retiring in 2013. He is leaving his role as club ambassador at the end of the season.
    
    Sporting have won 14 of their past 15 games in all competitions, only losing the Portuguese Super Cup this season.

    *   Manchester City's Erling Haaland has been directly involved in 49 goals in 42 appearances in the Champions League (44 goals, five assists). If he scores or assists on Tuesday, the 24-year-old will become the player to reach 50 goal involvements in the fewest games in the competition's history - a record currently held by former [Manchester United](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united) and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy (45).

    We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Manchester City.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Bournemouth fans:**
    
    **Rob:** A monkey off our back with the City win! Can you really now say, "it was an off day for City" and also, "an off day" in the Arsenal game? And... were Villa also having an "off day"? I think Bournemouth deserve more credit. Up the Cherries.
    
    **Steve:** A tremendous performance from the Cherries. Iraola’s tactics were played out to perfection and rather than go for the low block many teams use against City, Cherries played their natural attacking game and took it to the champions from the first minute. Still buzzing 24 hours later. Europa Conference spot could be in reach.
    
    **Derek:** Another great performance, seven points from three top teams. As seems to be often the case the result is portrayed as being due to top team being off par rather than Bournemouth playing well and taking the game to the opposition. Iraola has instilled a belief and collective teamwork that does not give up and works from start to finish. Joy to watch.
    
    **Peter:** A historic win. I think we knew as fans that we can beat anyone at home. We have to keep hold of Semenyo and Kerkez. Evanilson is fitting in well. I hope the last three games give the team the belief that they can challenge in the top half of the table. Iraola is a magician!
    
    **Man City fans:**
    
    **Suraj:** Very disappointing, don’t understand why the performance was so flat. I know we’ve got injuries, but we still had a strong side. Not sure why more were not used, maybe Pep’s worried about more injuries. Liverpool I think are the ones to look out for as unlike us they came back from behind. I'm just not feeling confident for this season.
    
    **Abdullah:** City were off it today. Until Jeremy Doku came on we were actually horrendous and were shown how to play. Doku and Gvardiol our only positive players. Semenyo and Kerkez were outstanding and fair play to Evanilson, who converted his sole chance (something we couldn't do). You can't control injuries but we will bounce back soon, we always do.
    
    **Steve:** A lacklustre performance from us, proven by the fact it was the 80th minute for our first shot on goal to arrive. After four consecutive titles, I am not convinced we have the same hunger we had in previous seasons. One positive out of the game was another excellent performance by Nunes. Congrats to Bournemouth, who thoroughly deserved the win.
    
    **Roger:** City have been fragile defensively all season and combined with an aging midfield and several players all striving to find their best form this defeat was long overdue. Pep will no doubt turn it round but possibly might need to use some fringe players to achieve it.

    All good things must come to an end.
    
    Manchester City's 32-match unbeaten run in the Premier League is over after a lacklustre performance at in-form Bournemouth.
    
    After Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat Tottenham, Pep Guardiola bemoaned having just 13 fit players, but he was still able to name a strong eleven to face Bournemouth - Erling Haaland, Ederson, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva featured from the start.
    
    But it just did not click for the Premier League champions, who were unbeaten across their previous 21 fixtures against Bournemouth, and the busy calendar might be just starting to catch up with them.
    
    Conceding early was far from ideal with Antoine Semenyo putting the hosts in front after nine minutes and the half ended with Bournemouth fans chanting "ole" following every completed pass.
    
    City were carved open when the Cherries doubled their lead through Evanilson and it took until the 80th minute for the visitors to register an attempt on target, albeit a tame one from Erling Haaland.
    
    They did half the deficit two minutes later through Josko Gvardiol, who scored his sixth goal in seven away Premier League games.
    
    Haaland thought he had grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time but Mark Travers saved and the Norwegian's follow-up struck the post.
    
    Losing is not something City are accustomed to - it is the first time they have lost successive games across all competitions since September 2023 and the first time they have tasted defeat in the league since December 2023.
    
    A trip to Porto, managed by incoming Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, is next up for City in the Champions League on Tuesday.

    **Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to BBC Match of the Day after today's loss:** "We knew we couldn't match the intensity. We have talked about it. It was an open game. We had chances at the end but I congratulate Bournemouth for the victory.
    
    "The 50-50 balls in the middle, the duels, they play this type of game. They are so aggressive. They had six-seven days to prepare. They have physicality and speed, but you have to win these types of situations. And they had chances. Ederson made a good save. We had real good moments at the start of the second half and after that it was difficult to swallow as we were good. After we scored we had momentum and chances but couldn't score \[again\]."
    
    **On injuries and fitness issues:** "It is what it is. We have few players with a lot of minutes and a lot of players with no minutes to the balance is a bit uncomfortable. We played good against Spurs but today we could not handle their intensity that they had and that's why we lost the game."

    Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches this season, against a variety of guests.
    
    For week 10, he takes on The Piano TV series winner Brad Kella.
    
    **Sutton's prediction: 1-2**
    
    This is another hard one to call. Manchester City's performances just haven't been there of late, but they are still finding a way to beat teams every week and I'm not sure what's going to be different this time.
    
    I don't think this is going to be easy for City, who are missing a few players though injury, but you have to remember how good they are at getting over the line in games like this.
    
    So, although I'm backing Bournemouth to score, I still expect City to edge this one.
    
    [Southampton,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton) [Wolves](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/wolverhampton-wanderers) and [Fulham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham) have all run the champions close recently, and all of them still lost. It could be the same story for the Cherries too.
    
    They are likely to be a lot more ambitious than Saints were at Etihad Stadium and that could suit City.
    
    Bournemouth are a team who get plenty of shots off and we saw what they did to [Arsenal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal) a couple of weeks ago, but that will leave more space for Pep Guardiola's side.
    
    **Brad's prediction: 2-1**
    
    I want a Bournemouth win and I think they can get one. Rodri has been a massive loss for Manchester City since he got injured and they have got a few other players out too.

    Speaking on a new episode of You'll Never Beat Kyle Walker on BBC Sounds, the Manchester City captain paid tribute to City team-mate and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri.
    
    "For him, it's absolutely fantastic," said the England full-back. "I think he's been nothing short of probably perfect in the last couple of seasons. You can see what he means to Man City.
    
    "I think this season we've adapted very well without him but in the last couple of seasons when he's not really been there, we've not really been the same Man City. The goals that he's scored, the assists that he's provided, it's not really a defensive midfielder.
    
    "'Gundo' \[Ilkay Gundogan\] said something in a post someone sent me and for a defensive player to get that award, for us defensive-minded players it means a little bit more.
    
    "If you look at the last 10-15 years, you've got Messi and Ronaldo without a shadow of a doubt, then Luka's \[Modric\] got it and then Benzema. It's recognition for the work that he's putting in without getting the headlines."

    As soon as Pep Guardiola answered my opening question at Friday's press conference with "you'll see tomorrow", I got the sense the Manchester City boss was not going to be too forthcoming about his side's injury issues.
    
    Part of it will be to keep Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola guessing over who will be in the City side at Vitality Stadium, but part will also be because he is waiting to discover exactly who is available and for how long.
    
    Guardiola accepted it is not unusual for clubs to suffer a long injury list. He also knows what a negative impact it can have.
    
    He mentioned Liverpool. In 2022-23 Jurgen Klopp's men in the end did well to finish fifth, with 67 points, a year after they had finished second with 92.
    
    That is the scenario Guardiola will be anxious to avoid this season.
    
    City are top. But you get the sense if they win a fifth Premier League title in a row, he would regard this one as the best.

    Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against [Bournemouth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/afc-bournemouth) (kick-off 15:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the key lines from his news conference:
    
    *   Savinho could be available for Saturday's trip to Vitality Stadium as it was "just a strong knock" he suffered against [Tottenham](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur) and "no fracture".
        
    *   Guardiola says he "has many doubts" about who else could recover in time and he will "talk to players and the doctors" on Saturday morning.
        
    *   He said "we are in an emergency in certain positions" but the academy players are there to support and he trusts them.
        
    *   More on City's growing injury list: "It is what it is. It happens in many clubs and we're not the only club in the world to be going through it."
        
    *   Guardiola said he has told the players to "not feel sorry for ourselves".
        
    *   He said "the squad is enough when completely focused and fit" in response to whether he will look to bring players in during the January transfer window.
        
    *   On whether a conversation needs to be had about the football calendar and its toll on players' health: "We know it \[is too many games\], but it is the reality. We try to take care of them. We’ve not done anything differently to previous seasons. If anything we’ve trained less. But it happens and you have to adapt."

    The decision to allow Manchester City's stoppage-time winner against Wolves on 20 October has been backed by an independent panel.
    
    [John Stones' header was eventually awarded](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c93yv0xewzpt) following a pitchside review by referee Chris Kavanagh after it had initially been disallowed for offside, with Bernardo Silva standing close to Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.
    
    The Key Match Incident panel, which reviews the big decisions from every Premier League game, unanimously agreed with the VAR intervention, saying Silva was "not clearly in the line of the goalkeeper's vision or impacting his ability to make a save".
    
    During the game, the [Premier League Match Centre posted on X:, external](https://x.com/PLMatchCentre/status/1848017633133613354) "Stones' goal was disallowed on-field due to Bernardo Silva being in an offside position and in the goalkeeper's line of vision. The VAR deemed Bernardo Silva wasn't in the line of vision and had no impact on the goalkeeper and recommended an on-field review. The referee overturned his original decision and a goal was awarded."
    
    That weekend's fixtures - the eighth round of Premier League matches - saw multiple VAR reviews with penalties overturned and yellow cards upgraded to reds.
    
    In October, referees' chief Howard Webb said there had [been an 80% reduction](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cgmgrljderro) in the number of video assistant referee (VAR) errors this season compared to 2023-24.

    Manchester City defender Callum Doyle has played all but around five minutes of Norwich City's Championship season so far, and that tells its own story.
    
    It is fair to say he has been a revelation for the team - beginning the campaign as a central defender but moving to left-back in more recent weeks. The highlight was a brilliant goal against Watford in a 4-1 win at Carrow Road.
    
    He already has more than 90 games under his belt in the second tier following loan spells at [Leicester,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) Coventry and Sunderland and, at the age of 21, he looks very comfortable in the division. Doyle is also a regular for England Under-21s.
    
    The Canaries' new Danish head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup likes his full-backs to cover a lot of ground and join in with central midfield positions when needed. Doyle has been the perfect player for the job.
    
    He is strong on the ball and plays with energy and a clear toughness that goes a long way in the hustle and bustle of the Championship. Sometimes his eagerness to get forward does have the potential to leave defensive areas exposed, but Norwich fans are quick to applaud his gut-busting runs to get back into position.
    
    The Carrow Road faithful are already dreaming of a permanent move for his services but it is clear he is a player who is destined for the Premier League, one way or another.

Sun 3 November 2024 21:00, UK

Man United and Chelsea have joined Tottenham in the “huge” race to sign Lecce star Patrick Dorgu, **sources have told Football Insider.**

[Speaking on the latest edition of **Football Insider’s Inside Track podcast**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6HnmVC5VxoW1TqcVQbgPG6), senior correspondent Pete O’Rourke revealed that the 20-year-old’s performances in Serie A have caught the eye of top clubs from across Europe.

Interest from United comes following the appointment of Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, with the boss said to be keen to bring in players to suit his style of play.

Luke Shaw’s injury issues have often forced Diogo Dalot to fill in at left-back, but Dorgu’s ability to play higher up as a wing-back has made him a key target.

However, Tottenham and Chelsea are also keeping close tabs on his development and have been tipped to make moves should he become available.

**Football Insider** revealed on 18 October that [Spurs are looking to sign and develop some of Europe’s brightest talents, and Dorgu ranks among them.](https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-tottenham-working-to-sign-some-of-europes-biggest-talents/)

**_Tottenham, Man United and Chelsea race to sign Patrick Dorgu_**
------------------------------------------------------------------

Dorgu has made 12 appearances for Lecce across all competitions so far this season, and has showcased a capability to play across the pitch.

Primarily a left-back, he has also played as a wing-back, left-midfielder, left-winger, right-winger and right-back as he continues to display tremendous versatility.

He is also a Denmark international with three caps to his name despite his tender age, and he has scored one goal for his country – in a 2-0 Nations League win against Switzerland.

This has inspired interest from top clubs in the Premier League who believe he could be a long-term signing both for the present and to become a star in the future.

Among those interested is Tottenham, as the club remain keen to bolster their back line amid growing concerns about a lack of quality strength in depth across the defence.

Man United, meanwhile, are said to be interested in rediscovering their reputation for utilising the game’s top young talents and helping them to grow at Old Trafford.

**Football Insider** revealed on 2 November that [the Red Devils are keen to develop a bright young talent into a superstar and allow them to make their name at the club.](https://www.footballinsider247.com/man-united-plan-to-buy-young-gem-and-transform-him-into-superstar/)

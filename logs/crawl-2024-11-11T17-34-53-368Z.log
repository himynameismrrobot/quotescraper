    After caretaker manager Rudd van Nistelrooy signed off his temporary time in charge with a second win over [Leicester](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city), The Devils' Advocate team have been reacting to a result that leaves them just four points off the top four.
    
    They also discuss whether the club legend should stay on as part of incoming boss Ruben Amorim's backroom staff when he begins his new job this week.

    BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions.
    
    **@CF3Loyal asked:** Does Ruud van Nistelrooy’s success at Manchester United as interim manager, in addition to his relationship with the club, fans and players, cause a potential issue for Ruben Amorim when he takes over - assuming that he remains as part of his management team?
    
    **Phil answered:** Well, we should find out the answer to whether he will be part of that management team very soon.
    
    Van Nistelrooy could not have done much more in his spell as interim manager. He clearly loved the role and seems to want to stay at United. The fans who adore him will have no objection to that.
    
    The problem is that Ruben Amorim has a tried and trusted, very close-knit, support team and it is hard to see where Van Nistelrooy would fit into that.
    
    It is also difficult to see a powerful, opinionated personality such as Van Nistelrooy wanting to be a silent partner in that group simply to stay at Manchester United.
    
    It is a very delicate situation and one of the first tasks Amorim has to address.

    We asked for your thoughts after [Sunday's Premier League game](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c1lgj2eje9vt) between Manchester United and Leicester.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Man Utd fans**
    
    **Warren:** Manuel Ugarte is looking better and better and he made a huge difference to Casemiro, which was also very good. The midfield looked solid but the defence never looked safe with Diogo Dalot poor. Marcus Rashford was sadly anonymous again.
    
    **Eric:** We played great, with Amad Diallo as man of the match. We closed them down and were on the attack in the first half. The second half was slack but Leicester didn't score. Two great goals and I enjoyed it. I hope Ruben Amorim keeps Ruud van Nistelrooy.
    
    **Peter:** Not the best game ever but three goals and three valuable points will do. Some good performances: Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte... but poor from Dalot and Rashford. There is much work for Amorim to do but 100% effort is a minimum for every player.
    
    **Leicester fans**
    
    **Nigel:** Once again we were outplayed. Every Leicester ball was either over hit or passed to no one. It's one thing to play well on the training ground but another when you play your opposition. all in all a very disjointed performance. Feel we might be going down now.
    
    **JC:** Passive and disappointing. I didn’t expect us to win but I expected us to compete against a very average Man Utd side. I’ve been a supporter of Steve Cooper but today I could not see what the team were trying to do.
    
    **Stephen:** A shocking performance. No fight, no closing down and the defending was shocking. Not doing the basics right.

    Manchester United midfielder Casemiro says "it's been a good season" for him personally so far, despite the Red Devils' lowly league position.
    
    After being [urged to leave the club, external](https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/13130826/leave-before-the-football-leaves-you-jamie-carragher-thinks-casemiro-needs-to-leave-top-level-football) by Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher after a 4-0 defeat at [Crystal Palace](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace) in May, the 32-year-old has bounced back and started seven of United's 11 Premier League games this campaign.
    
    After Sunday's 3-0 win over [Leicester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city), he said: "Well, everyone can see, can't they? "I only had the [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) game, right \[the 3-0 home defeat in September\]? The whole team was not good in that game, or this season.
    
    "Individually, when the goals are missed, of course it ends up hurting the team more, but I think it's been a good season for me."
    
    The win over the Foxes marked the end of interim manager Ruud Van Nistelrooy's time in charge before Ruben Amorim assumes control over the international break.
    
    "He was a legend at Manchester United, he was a legend at Madrid," Casemiro said. "He is a legend of number nines.
    
    "It was a pleasure to share that moment with him. We do not know if he will stay or not, but it was a pleasure to share the dressing room with him."
    
    The five-time Champions League winner believes Amorim can bring success back to Old Trafford, after he secured Sporting's first Portuguese title in 19 years.
    
    "He has already proved he is a coach that has won a lot," Casemiro added.
    
    "There is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn."

    On Sunday's episode of Match of the Day 2, ex-Watford striker Troy Deeney highlighted the performances on Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro in central midfield as one area which has been much improved under Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy in recent games.
    
    "It's been a small tactical tweak of just not allowing the game to be so expansive," said Deeney.
    
    "They were looking after each other and were right in the middle of the pitch. They were never too far away from each other so if one of them made a mistake, the second one is there to help him out. They worked as a partnership.
    
    "In weeks gone past they were 30-40m away from one another. Now they're playing little passes with each other and controlling things.
    
    That's what Casemiro and Ugarte bring to your team. There's a reason they were at the clubs they were at before."

    **Former Premier League midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast about Ruud van Nistelrooy's spell as interim boss of Manchester United:**
    
    "We said before that he had his time in the limelight now and he had to use it wisely, and he's done it. We've seen a completely different Manchester United, playing the same 4-2-3-1 and he hasn't changed them tactically, but we're seeing a response from the players.
    
    "For the CEOs and directors of football, they should be watching that and saying that what Van Nistelrooy has done at United - a club that was an absolute mess - in such a short time with the same players, means he should be one people may be looking at for potential manager jobs.
    
    "He's done everything that you'd expect him to do and now it's just who is going to be wise enough to give him a good opportunity at a good club."

    **Ruud van Nistelrooy spoke to BBC Sport after Manchester United's victory against Leicester; his final match as interim manager:** "It was professional, you could see that players were fighting through the game. We scored two great goals and there were some good bits but we didn't have real control of the game.
    
    "It was an important three points. In the four games Bruno scored some important goals, assisting too so he is back producing. That's the Bruno that is helping the team the most.
    
    "I spoke to Alejandro Garnacho before the game, he has played a lot of minutes and I wanted him to make an impact off the bench and I'm glad it worked out. We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did an OK job.
    
    "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period. We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs and help the club which is important.
    
    "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment. To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough.
    
    "We will learn what the further plan is now."

    **Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes spoke to BBC Sport after Sunday's victory against Leicester:** "It was a good day at work, I have to say. We have a lot of players with big qualities, but people can get too excited after one game and too down after another.
    
    "Garnacho scored a banger but didn't celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him people will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.
    
    "I told him to celebrate, it was something special. He is a special player, we have difference makers. They are the ones who win us games. We want them to score every game but that isn't going to happen.
    
    "The Fantasy managers won't be happy with you guys taking that goal off me."
    
18.  ![Image 17: Bruno Fernandes scores for Manchester United](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/8005/live/bc348930-9f7e-11ef-a78a-cf70d1c044ad.jpg.webp)Image source, Getty Images
    
    Bruno Fernandes made his 250th appearance for Manchester United on Sunday. Since debuting for the club in February 2020, he’s played in more matches than any other player for a Premier League club across all competitions, while only Mohamed Salah (198) has been involved in more goals for such clubs than him (155 – 83 goals, 72 assists).
    
    The midfielder has been directly involved in 100 goals in 170 appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League (56 goals, 44 assists), reaching this milestone with just one more appearance than Cristiano Ronaldo (169) had upon doing so.

    Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.
    
    For week 11 he takes on Mylee and Tate from CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson FC (JJFC), which is set in the world of an elite academy at fictional Premier League club Hawx United.
    
    **Sutton's prediction:** 2-1
    
    Manchester United thrashed Leicester in the Carabao Cup at the end of October in Ruud van Nistelrooy's first game as interim manager, but the Foxes had made nine changes from their previous league game.
    
    So I am not sure that 5-2 scoreline tells us too much about what will happen here, but I do think United will win again.
    
    I have put United midfielder Bruno Fernandes back into my fantasy team. I should have captained him last week, when he scored a penalty against [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) - my assistant \[his son Ollie, who is the 'Taylor' in their Brian Clough and Peter Taylor managerial partnership\] told me to do that, but I didn't listen.
    
    **Mylee's prediction:** Another close one, and I am going to give it to Leicester. 0-1
    
    **Tate's prediction:** United are very difficult to predict until their new manager takes over, so I am going for Leicester - they are a Midlands club after all! 1-2.

    Manchester United coach Darren Fletcher has received an extended three-match touchline ban and been fined £7,500 for misconduct against [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) on Saturday 19 October.
    
    Fletcher is alleged to have acted in an "improper and/or confrontational manner" and used "abusive and/or insulting words" towards the match officials during the Premier League victory at Old Trafford.
    
    United were furious following Brentford's opener from Ethan Pinnock, which came after home defender Matthijs de Ligt was forced to leave the field for a third time to deal with a cut on his head.
    
    Former midfielder Fletcher admitted to this misconduct but has denied that he was abusive with BBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone saying United plan to appeal.
    
25.  **Phil Cartwright**  
    BBC Sport journalist
    
    Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against [Leicester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) (kick-off 14:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the key lines from his news conference:
    
    *   He hopes Amad Diallo will be available to face the Foxes, while Kobbie Mainoo is "making the right steps" in his recovery from injury but is "not yet with the team".
        
    *   Van Nistelrooy added that it was "good" that left-back Luke Shaw and fellow defender Leny Yoro are back in training after long-term injuries.
        
    *   Sunday's match will be Van Nistelrooy's fourth and final one in caretaker charge before Ruben Amorim takes over on Monday. He said: "It has been a special period and it was important to get through the four games as well as we could. We've done very well so far - the players reacted very well in the games. The focus is now to build on that and show that on Sunday with a big game ahead and a massive three points there to win."
        
    *   Asked if it will be his "second farewell" from the club, with his future at Old Trafford still unclear, Van Nistelrooy said: "There's not much more news from yesterday evening. Ruben and I are both focusing on our teams and our games."
        
    *   On how he has felt during his time as interim boss: "I've enjoyed it. The reaction of the players was outstanding. As an assistant you are quite close to players, so in the past three months I've spent a lot of time with the players and got to know them very well as human beings and also as football players, where they are in their development and how I can help. I think that relationship is helping now that we are together and we want to achieve something together."
        
    *   He continued: "That bond is there. I feel very supported so that gives a lot of energy, and the support of the fans obviously was amazing. That also gives lots of confidence and energy."
        
    *   On whether being in charge has given him the appetite to be a manager again: "The appetite to build further within this club is stronger than the other bit \[being a manager himself\]. I made a deliberate decision to step into this role for two seasons and take it from there. These four games haven't changed that sentiment and that's why I said at the beginning what my intentions were - also after my interim job."

    **@CF3Loyal asked:** Does Ruud van Nistelrooy’s success at Manchester United as interim manager, in addition to his relationship with the club, fans and players, cause a potential issue for Ruben Amorim when he takes over - assuming that he remains as part of his management team?
    
    **Phil answered:** Well, we should find out the answer to whether he will be part of that management team very soon.
    
    Van Nistelrooy could not have done much more in his spell as interim manager. He clearly loved the role and seems to want to stay at United. The fans who adore him will have no objection to that.
    
    The problem is that Ruben Amorim has a tried and trusted, very close-knit, support team and it is hard to see where Van Nistelrooy would fit into that.
    
    It is also difficult to see a powerful, opinionated personality such as Van Nistelrooy wanting to be a silent partner in that group simply to stay at Manchester United.
    
    It is a very delicate situation and one of the first tasks Amorim has to address.

    We asked for your thoughts after [Sunday's Premier League game](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c1lgj2eje9vt) between Manchester United and Leicester.
    
    Here are some of your comments:
    
    **Man Utd fans**
    
    **Warren:** Manuel Ugarte is looking better and better and he made a huge difference to Casemiro, which was also very good. The midfield looked solid but the defence never looked safe with Diogo Dalot poor. Marcus Rashford was sadly anonymous again.
    
    **Eric:** We played great, with Amad Diallo as man of the match. We closed them down and were on the attack in the first half. The second half was slack but Leicester didn't score. Two great goals and I enjoyed it. I hope Ruben Amorim keeps Ruud van Nistelrooy.
    
    **Peter:** Not the best game ever but three goals and three valuable points will do. Some good performances: Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte... but poor from Dalot and Rashford. There is much work for Amorim to do but 100% effort is a minimum for every player.
    
    **Leicester fans**
    
    **Nigel:** Once again we were outplayed. Every Leicester ball was either over hit or passed to no one. It's one thing to play well on the training ground but another when you play your opposition. all in all a very disjointed performance. Feel we might be going down now.
    
    **JC:** Passive and disappointing. I didn’t expect us to win but I expected us to compete against a very average Man Utd side. I’ve been a supporter of Steve Cooper but today I could not see what the team were trying to do.
    
    **Stephen:** A shocking performance. No fight, no closing down and the defending was shocking. Not doing the basics right.

    Manchester United midfielder Casemiro says "it's been a good season" for him personally so far, despite the Red Devils' lowly league position.
    
    After being [urged to leave the club, external](https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/13130826/leave-before-the-football-leaves-you-jamie-carragher-thinks-casemiro-needs-to-leave-top-level-football) by Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher after a 4-0 defeat at [Crystal Palace](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace) in May, the 32-year-old has bounced back and started seven of United's 11 Premier League games this campaign.
    
    After Sunday's 3-0 win over [Leicester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city), he said: "Well, everyone can see, can't they? "I only had the [Liverpool](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool) game, right \[the 3-0 home defeat in September\]? The whole team was not good in that game, or this season.
    
    "Individually, when the goals are missed, of course it ends up hurting the team more, but I think it's been a good season for me."
    
    The win over the Foxes marked the end of interim manager Ruud Van Nistelrooy's time in charge before Ruben Amorim assumes control over the international break.
    
    "He was a legend at Manchester United, he was a legend at Madrid," Casemiro said. "He is a legend of number nines.
    
    "It was a pleasure to share that moment with him. We do not know if he will stay or not, but it was a pleasure to share the dressing room with him."
    
    The five-time Champions League winner believes Amorim can bring success back to Old Trafford, after he secured Sporting's first Portuguese title in 19 years.
    
    "He has already proved he is a coach that has won a lot," Casemiro added.
    
    "There is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn."

    On Sunday's episode of Match of the Day 2, ex-Watford striker Troy Deeney highlighted the performances on Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro in central midfield as one area which has been much improved under Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy in recent games.
    
    "It's been a small tactical tweak of just not allowing the game to be so expansive," said Deeney.
    
    "They were looking after each other and were right in the middle of the pitch. They were never too far away from each other so if one of them made a mistake, the second one is there to help him out. They worked as a partnership.
    
    "In weeks gone past they were 30-40m away from one another. Now they're playing little passes with each other and controlling things.
    
    That's what Casemiro and Ugarte bring to your team. There's a reason they were at the clubs they were at before."

    **Former Premier League midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast about Ruud van Nistelrooy's spell as interim boss of Manchester United:**
    
    "We said before that he had his time in the limelight now and he had to use it wisely, and he's done it. We've seen a completely different Manchester United, playing the same 4-2-3-1 and he hasn't changed them tactically, but we're seeing a response from the players.
    
    "For the CEOs and directors of football, they should be watching that and saying that what Van Nistelrooy has done at United - a club that was an absolute mess - in such a short time with the same players, means he should be one people may be looking at for potential manager jobs.
    
    "He's done everything that you'd expect him to do and now it's just who is going to be wise enough to give him a good opportunity at a good club."

    **Ruud van Nistelrooy spoke to BBC Sport after Manchester United's victory against Leicester; his final match as interim manager:** "It was professional, you could see that players were fighting through the game. We scored two great goals and there were some good bits but we didn't have real control of the game.
    
    "It was an important three points. In the four games Bruno scored some important goals, assisting too so he is back producing. That's the Bruno that is helping the team the most.
    
    "I spoke to Alejandro Garnacho before the game, he has played a lot of minutes and I wanted him to make an impact off the bench and I'm glad it worked out. We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did an OK job.
    
    "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period. We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs and help the club which is important.
    
    "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment. To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough.
    
    "We will learn what the further plan is now."

    **Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes spoke to BBC Sport after Sunday's victory against Leicester:** "It was a good day at work, I have to say. We have a lot of players with big qualities, but people can get too excited after one game and too down after another.
    
    "Garnacho scored a banger but didn't celebrate like he should because he thinks he has lost faith from some fans. I told him people will always moan but lots of people like you and enjoy what you do.
    
    "I told him to celebrate, it was something special. He is a special player, we have difference makers. They are the ones who win us games. We want them to score every game but that isn't going to happen.
    
    "The Fantasy managers won't be happy with you guys taking that goal off me."

    Bruno Fernandes made his 250th appearance for Manchester United on Sunday. Since debuting for the club in February 2020, he’s played in more matches than any other player for a Premier League club across all competitions, while only Mohamed Salah (198) has been involved in more goals for such clubs than him (155 – 83 goals, 72 assists).
    
    The midfielder has been directly involved in 100 goals in 170 appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League (56 goals, 44 assists), reaching this milestone with just one more appearance than Cristiano Ronaldo (169) had upon doing so.

    Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.
    
    For week 11 he takes on Mylee and Tate from CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson FC (JJFC), which is set in the world of an elite academy at fictional Premier League club Hawx United.
    
    **Sutton's prediction:** 2-1
    
    Manchester United thrashed Leicester in the Carabao Cup at the end of October in Ruud van Nistelrooy's first game as interim manager, but the Foxes had made nine changes from their previous league game.
    
    So I am not sure that 5-2 scoreline tells us too much about what will happen here, but I do think United will win again.
    
    I have put United midfielder Bruno Fernandes back into my fantasy team. I should have captained him last week, when he scored a penalty against [Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea) - my assistant \[his son Ollie, who is the 'Taylor' in their Brian Clough and Peter Taylor managerial partnership\] told me to do that, but I didn't listen.
    
    **Mylee's prediction:** Another close one, and I am going to give it to Leicester. 0-1
    
    **Tate's prediction:** United are very difficult to predict until their new manager takes over, so I am going for Leicester - they are a Midlands club after all! 1-2.

    Manchester United coach Darren Fletcher has received an extended three-match touchline ban and been fined £7,500 for misconduct against [Brentford](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brentford) on Saturday 19 October.
    
    Fletcher is alleged to have acted in an "improper and/or confrontational manner" and used "abusive and/or insulting words" towards the match officials during the Premier League victory at Old Trafford.
    
    United were furious following Brentford's opener from Ethan Pinnock, which came after home defender Matthijs de Ligt was forced to leave the field for a third time to deal with a cut on his head.
    
    Former midfielder Fletcher admitted to this misconduct but has denied that he was abusive with BBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone saying United plan to appeal.
    
25.  **Phil Cartwright**  
    BBC Sport journalist
    
    Manchester United interim boss Ruud van Nistelrooy has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against [Leicester City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/leicester-city) (kick-off 14:00 GMT).
    
    Here are the key lines from his news conference:
    
    *   He hopes Amad Diallo will be available to face the Foxes, while Kobbie Mainoo is "making the right steps" in his recovery from injury but is "not yet with the team".
        
    *   Van Nistelrooy added that it was "good" that left-back Luke Shaw and fellow defender Leny Yoro are back in training after long-term injuries.
        
    *   Sunday's match will be Van Nistelrooy's fourth and final one in caretaker charge before Ruben Amorim takes over on Monday. He said: "It has been a special period and it was important to get through the four games as well as we could. We've done very well so far - the players reacted very well in the games. The focus is now to build on that and show that on Sunday with a big game ahead and a massive three points there to win."
        
    *   Asked if it will be his "second farewell" from the club, with his future at Old Trafford still unclear, Van Nistelrooy said: "There's not much more news from yesterday evening. Ruben and I are both focusing on our teams and our games."
        
    *   On how he has felt during his time as interim boss: "I've enjoyed it. The reaction of the players was outstanding. As an assistant you are quite close to players, so in the past three months I've spent a lot of time with the players and got to know them very well as human beings and also as football players, where they are in their development and how I can help. I think that relationship is helping now that we are together and we want to achieve something together."
        
    *   He continued: "That bond is there. I feel very supported so that gives a lot of energy, and the support of the fans obviously was amazing. That also gives lots of confidence and energy."
        
    *   On whether being in charge has given him the appetite to be a manager again: "The appetite to build further within this club is stronger than the other bit \[being a manager himself\]. I made a deliberate decision to step into this role for two seasons and take it from there. These four games haven't changed that sentiment and that's why I said at the beginning what my intentions were - also after my interim job."

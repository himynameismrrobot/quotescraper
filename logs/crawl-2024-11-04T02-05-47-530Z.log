Moises Caicedo’s volley found the bottom corner. Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford. READ MORE: United vs Chelsea as it happened READ MORE: Mourinho thinks United are getting the best coach in Portugal in Amorim Andre Onana His kicking was iffy at times amid Chelsea's pressing and Moises Caicedo’s strike was not quite in the corner. 6 Diogo Dalot Another sub-par performance accompanied by a deserved booking for a deliberate and cynical foul. Calmer in the second half but had no influ
ence. 5 Matthijs de Ligt Executed a good block to thwart Cole Palmer early in the first half. Showed good leadership at times with United often under pressure. 6 Lisandro Martinez Back at centre back and better for it. Used the ball cooler than most teammates. Still too pent-up with elements of his play. 6 Noussair Mazraoui United's best player and only good performer in a first half of random play. Showed why he should have started the season at left back. 7 Casemiro Had to be told to be more c
ompact with Manuel Ugarte by Van Nistelrooy. Survived some awkward spells to make the penalty happen. 6 Manuel Ugarte Still floundering at Premier League level. Bossed by Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia and booked for a cynical shove on Cole Palmer. 5 Marcus Rashford Cushioned a volley against the woodwork with the final kick of the first half. Ineffective but worked hard before he made way for Amad in the 72nd minute. 5 Bruno Fernandes Tried without succeeding before half-time but created a chan
ce for Rashford. Converted the penalty for his first league goal of the season. 6 Alejandro Garnacho A physical mismatch against Malo Gusto in possibly his weakest performance of the season. Had three good goalscoring openings and underhit them all. 4 Rasmus Hojlund Started bullishly and looked a physical match for Wesley Fofana and Levi Colwill but regressed and irked the crowd with delayed passes for Garnacho. Won the penalty through a heavy touch. 5 Subs Amad Had little of the ball. 5 Joshua 
Zirkzee Did not look like a striker again. 4 Victor Lindelof

    There were bound to be parallels aplenty with the Dutch-managed United of last month. United's shape was forlorn, as it usually is against the Premier League's big hitters, their play was devoid of strategy, largely absent of quality and reliant on the counter-attack. United were without ten players and the absences of Christian Eriksen and Kobbie Mainoo were particularly felt in a contest controlled by the visiting side. It was a novelty fo
r United to encounter a costlier midfield than their own but Moises Caicedo's British record £125million fee is starting to look moot now.

d Ruud van Nistelrooy's week in the manager's office ended creditably. Van Nistelrooy has conducted himself impeccably on the touchline, at the training ground and with the press since his temporary promotion on Monday. United ought to be bullish about two wins against PAOK and Leicester City next week. There was a flicker of managerial strategy behind their breakthrough. Rasmus Hojlund would have been a logical withdrawal yet played on and elicited the rash contact from Robert Sanchez that allo
wed Bruno Fernandes to notch a first Premier League goal of the season. Casemiro and Andre Onana, on their haunches in the centre circle, could not look and faced each other. They then heard the roar and embraced. Van Nistelrooy charged down the touchline, pumped his fists and turned to those in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Hojlund's miscontrol made the penalty possible from a visionary pass from Casemiro, more effective attacking from midfield rather than defending it. His header inadvertently
 assisted Caicedo's fine equaliser. Not for the first time against United, Caicedo was the best player on the pitch. Until United's midfield malaise ends, they will continue to rue the day they passed on signing the Ecuadorian for £5million in 2021. They played Culture Club's Karma Chameleon as kick-off loomed, a subtle ode to Van Nistelrooy. The day's soundtrack ended to that tune as the Stretford End put their hands together for their latest Dutch figurehead and chanted his name. The rendition
 of 'Take Me Home' was also louder and hollered with greater gusto than for any previous home fixture since it was bumped up the pre-match playlist. Removing Erik ten Hag and the choice of Van Nistelrooy as an interim have at least improved the Old Trafford acoustics, if not the football. Van Nistelrooy applauded Noussair Mazraoui following a recovery sprint and was critical of Matthijs de Ligt for going backwards rather than forwards. In defence of the defence, everything in front of them was h
aphazard. United's attempted pressing quartet was swiftly abandoned. Caicedo did a number on United a few times with Brighton and one virtuoso flick in his own third led to a Chelsea corner that Noni Madueke nodded against the upright. Twenty-five minutes in, Van Nistelrooy ordered Casemiro to adopt a more compact position next to Manuel Ugarte yet Chelsea continued to find the gaps. Wythenshawe-born Cole Palmer, scorer of four goals against United last term, was curiously blunt in the final thi
rd. "City reject," the Stretford End crowed just past the hour. Palmer heard it again as he headed down the tunnel. Ugarte, carded for shoving Palmer to the turf, was rollicked by De Ligt for eschewing a duel with Caicedo. Midfield was patently the area United had to prioritise with their summer recruitment. Ugarte's late arrival and his suspect league performances mean it is still the pressing area to address for Ruben Amorim. Fernandes, as is his wont, almost fashioned something out of nothing
 in an insipid first half with its penultimate kick. His clipped cross was wellied against the upright by Marcus Rashford, his clubface technique ensuring the ball was off-target. Hojlund began bullishly but soon regressed. Twice in as many minutes he failed to release the ball quickly for Garnacho, his teammate for 15 months now. The crowd was audibly irked the second time, their frustration cut short by referee Robert Jones's refusal to award Hojlund. Jones was woefully out of his depth and ca
stigated by United fans at full-time. When Wesley Fofana barged past Hojlund in the 64th minute, the crowd's frustration loudened. The sighs reverberated more widely when the unmarked Alejandro Garnacho scooped the ball into Robert Sanchez's midriff. Garnacho had his weakest performance of an otherwise bright season.

            Van Nistelrooy turned to the dugout in the 50

Hake was summoned again as Van Nistelrooy pondered a breakthrough from the bench. His patience prevailed without having to make a change. Yet Ratcliffe still did not see United win.

Ruud van Nistelrooy is looking forward to meeting incoming Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim but no discussions are planned while he remains in interim charge. Amorim will officially take over as the new United head coach on November 11 after he serves out his notice period at Sporting. Van Nistelrooy will manage United in their fourth Europa League match against PAOK on Thursday and for the visit of Leicester City in the Premier League on Sunday.

    Unite
d could introduce Amorim at the start of the November internationals and the 39-year-old is expected to be joined by up to five backroom staff members from Sporting. That has cast doubt on Van Nistelrooy's role at United, where he is under contract as an assistant coach.

"Obviously, he has done very 
well in Portugal, he’s a very young, talented coach and did well for a long time over a longer spell in Portugal. So, as I said, looking forward to keep helping the club forward and that’s my main goal.Top Stories1Bruno Fernandes reveals Manchester United dressing room reaction to Chelsea draw2Gary Neville sends 'clueless' warning to Ruben Amorim before Man United arrival3Gary Neville slams Manchester United tactic vs Chelsea and fumes at Andre Onana "I haven’t spoken to him and, at this moment,
 there is nothing planned for any conversation at all. I am doing my job to prepare for the Thursday and Sunday games and, in the meantime, I wait for how things develop in the communication towards the new head coach." United let a 1-0 lead slip to draw 1-1 with Chelsea in the Premier League, leaving them 13th in the table. United have won three of their ten league fixtures and still have a -3 goal difference.

            Bruno Fernandes put United 1-0 up from the penalty spot with only their ninth league goal of the campaign. Starting striker Rasmus Hojlund and replacement Joshua Zirkzee both struggled in the stalemate. Zirkzee has managed one goal in 15 games for United. "Today, we are slightly disappointed because we didn’t score the second with the opportunities we had, that is the feeling for me personally and also the dressing room," Van Nistelrooy added. "The last games we played we 
lost some points because we didn’t convert our chances. The good thing is we create a lot all through the season so far. In that sense, I am not too worried. When the players get in the flow of it with results coming and confidence growing, then goals will come."

Bruno Fernandes said there was a 'lot of disappointment' inside the Manchester United dressing room following Sunday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford. After taking a 70th-minute lead via Fernandes' first Premier League goal of the season from the penalty spot, United were pegged back just four minutes later through a wonderful effort from Moises Caicedo.

            Offering an insight into life under Van Nistelrooy, Fernandes added: "Not much has changed. In midweek the goals went in.  "I said to some 
friends everything will come to us and people will say we wanted the manager to be sacked. We get the point and we can be happy for that. We need to be disappointed because we're far back in the league. "Ruud is a nice guy, humble for someone who won everything at the club."

=== START OF TEXT TO BE SENT TO OPENAI FOR QUOTE EXTRACTION ===

Manchester United have now won just one of their last six Premier League matches after drawing 1-1 with Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. A low-quality game sparked into life inside the final 20 minutes when Rasmus Hojlund was clattered inside the penalty area by Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, resulting in Ruud van Nistelrooy's side being awarded a penalty. Bruno Fernandes stepped up and sent Sanchez the wrong way, claiming his first Premier League goal of the season. However, it 
didn't last long. Chelsea got themselves back on terms just four minutes later when Moises Caicedo fired in an excellent volley after United failed to clear a corner. Caicedo was one of the best players on the pitch and was worthy of his goal. United, as a result, are now winless in their last two league games, and end the weekend 13th in the table, seven points above the drop zone and six points shy of the top four.

 Sky Sports:"Everyone knows how much I wanted the goal to come. I need to help the team with goals and assists. It's been one of the most disappointing things this season - but I got some in the cup.

But it wasn't the goals that were immediately up for discussion after the final whistle, as that fell to the late foul committed by Martinez.

                Sir Alex Ferguson has already warned Ruben Amorim about one major Man United change

            Since then the Premier League have posted their own statement, which read: "The referee issued a yellow card to Martinez for a challenge on Palmer. VAR checked for a potential red card and confirmed the referee’s call of no red card, deeming that it w
as a reckless challenge."   This is in line with what former top-flight referee-turned-pundit, Mike Dean, told Sky Sports viewers, as he said: "He’s come down, he’s just caught the end of his knee with his studs. There’s not a lot of force in it, it’s more of a glancing blow down across his knee rather than endangering the safety of an opponent." Not long ago Martinez was also subject to debate for a similarly-judged reckless challenge against Crystal Palace. Today's booking is his fourth of the
 season, meaning one more would trigger an automatic one-game suspension.

Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has confirmed new head coach Ruben Amorim had no say in Manchester United's plans for the visit of Chelsea on Sunday afternoon. Amorim was installed as Erik ten Hag's permanent successor on Friday and will officially take charge at Old Trafford on November 11. His first game at the helm will be against Ipswich Town on November 24.

            Speaking in a separate interview ahead of kick-off, Van Nistelrooy also outlined the impact Rasmus Hojlund could have this afternoon. The Dane has been drafted back into the starting XI, replacing Joshua Zirkzee in attack. "He will have a very important part to play, Rasmus, today," Van Nistelrooy told MUTV. "I think Chelsea is a team that likes to press the opponent very high up the pitch and jump into man-vs-man situations, so we have to be clev
er with that, how we play out, how we find the free man and how we can use the space in behind of the full-backs and the centre-backs. "Rasmus is good at that. He will time his runs and use the space that they leave at the back. We will see how it works."

Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville has warned Ruben Amorim that he must deal with the club's lack of combinations when he arrives at Old Trafford. United and Chelsea played out a drab affair at Old Trafford as Ruud van Nistelrooy manages the club for the first time in the Premier League. His side were free flowing in midweek as they brushed aside Leicester City in the Carabao Cup but have struggled to get going against Enzo Maresca's Chelsea. When asked by commentator Peter Drury if A
morim will look to implement a 3-4-3 system immediately at Old Trafford, Neville explained that what he needs to implement is more fundamental than that. "I suspect the idea of implementing it during the season is a lot tougher than having pre-season with the team," he said. READ MORE: United vs Chelsea highlights

Walking the streets and being able to chat with fans in England, Europe, Asia, Australia, the USA - you inspired me and radiated a strong sense of unity. That's what makes United supporters so special. "I want to thank you for giving me this feeling and for your support. I also w

Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life.

            Sporting CP manager Ruben Amorim has been announced as the club's new manager but he won't commence his employment with United until Monday, November 11. 






  Ruud van Nistelrooy has been placed in interim charge in the meantime, and he began his reign with a 5-2 win over Leicester City in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. 
The Dutchman will lead United for today's Premier League clash against Chelsea, as well as Thursday's Europa League tie against Greek side PAOK, before another meeting with Leicester at Old Trafford.

Brailsford and Jean Claude Blanc, the Ineos chief executive for sport, are due to join the United football board. A new chief executive could report into Blanc but it is unlikely Patrick 
Stewart, the interim chief executive, will stay in the role permanently. Blanc and Brailsford accompanied Sir Jim Ratcliffe at meetings with United fan groups on Monday.

Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of his second game in interim charge on Sunday afternoon when Manchester United take on Chelsea at Old Trafford in the Premier League. The Dutchman kicked-off his stint as caretaker manager on Wednesday night in style with a 5-2 win over Leicester City in the EFL Cup. With Ruben Amorim's appointment confirmed yesterday, Van Nistelrooy will now take charge of three more games before the Portuguese officially starts his role.

    United's attention swiftly turns to Premier League a
ction with Enzo Maresca's men the opponents. Chelsea have hit a good run of form recently but crashed out of the EFL Cup on Wednesday. READ MORE: What Manchester United fans can expect from a Ruben Amorim side READ MORE: 'Most exciting young coach in Europe' - why Manchester United moved for Ruben Amorim Amorim is expected to be watching the game from afar ahead of his start date later next week. Van Nistelrooy is poised to pick from the same group of players who were involved against Leicester 
in midweek. With that said, here is all the very latest on the United injury front.Top Stories1How Manchester United could look next season with three major Ruben Amorim signings2Leny Yoro injury latest as Man United defender looks to make debut under Ruben Amorim3Yoro, Eriksen, Mainoo - Manchester United injury news and return dates ahead of Chelsea fixture Leny Yoro Injury: Fractured metatarsal United issued an update on Yoro last month, confirming he had started training outside at Carrington
. He has been unavailable since fracturing his metatarsal in the opening game of United's pre-season tour of the United States in July. United anticipated he would be sidelined for around three months after undergoing surgery at the start of August. He was walking without crutches as soon as early-September and has been working hard in the gym at Carrington since. He will not be rushed and his competitive debut for the club is 'not imminent'. Possible return date: November. Harry Maguire Injury:
 Foot Maguire has been absent since being forced off against Aston Villa prior to the international break. He limped off the field, requiring support from members of the United medical team, and was replaced by Matthijs de Ligt just before half-time.  Maguire posted on social media that he would be out for 'a few weeks', something former United boss Erik ten Hag confirmed a few days later. He has missed the last four matches. Possible return date: November.

 Luke Shaw Injury: Calf Shaw has now gone eight full months without playing for United. After originally being tipped to return after the first international break of the season in September and then after the second last month, his absence is still ongoing. Speaking after the defeat to West Ham United last weekend, Ten Hag confirmed Shaw had suffered a setback and that his recovery is not going in the direction United would have hoped 
for. He said: "The process is not going as we expected, that's the truth. The setback, if you want to call it like this, we want also to do it very careful. When he is now dropping again, we want to be very careful. "We know his past, we have to do this right, because we want him to be available, because he will have a big impact on our performances and also on our levels. We can't have him playing for some games and then drop out again. So, we will do it very carefully." Possible return date: U
nknown. Tyrell Malacia Injury: Knee Malacia has been training with the first-team in recent weeks, offering encouragement that his return might not be all that far away. He last played for United on the final day of the 2022/23 Premier League season. In August, Ten Hag said the defender was moving in the right direction, suggesting he could be back at some point in October: "He is not that far [off], but he is now in a progress situation. At a relatively short notice, he can again return into te
am training and then into team performance in games. I think it would be possible [to be available again] in two months." October, of course, has now been and gone and it remains to be seen when the left-back will be available for selection. Possible return date: Unknown.

 Kobbie Mainoo Injury: Muscle Mainoo suffered a muscle injury in the closing stages of United
's 0-0 draw with Villa and has missed the last four matches. Ten Hag, speaking at his pre-Brentford press conference a fortnight ago, said he expected the academy graduate to be unavailable for 'a couple of weeks'. It remains to be seen if he will be available for the visit of Chelsea. Possible return date: November 3 (Chelsea H). Christian Eriksen Injury: Unknown Eriksen was absent from the matchday squad against Leicester, watching the game from the directors' box. He is understood have pulled
 out of the squad through injury, but details of it have so far been kept under wraps. Possible return date: Unknown. Mason Mount Injury: Knock Mount has missed the last six matches after being forced off with a head injury that required stitches against Tottenham Hotspur on September 29.  Ten Hag, speaking ahead of last week's 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce, said: "I think a bit longer [to wait for Mount], that's what we expected. I think he will be back soon." Possible return date: Unknown.

 Toby Collyer Injury: Unknown Explaining why Jack Fletcher had been included in the squad for the win over Brentford almost a fortnight ago, Ten Hag revealed Collyer was another midfielder who had been added to the injury list. However, he stopped short of offering any detail on the nature or extent of his injury. The Manchester Evening News now understands he will be unavailable for 'roughly a month'. Possi
ble return date: December. Antony Injury: Sprained ankle

            After eight games p
layed in the U18 Premier League, United have eight wins and have scored a whopping 40 goals already. A statement to say the very least. The Red Devils are known for their esteemed academy and Amorim will be delighted that despite some trouble at the top, the Carrington hotbed of talent continues to deliver year after year. Scanlon, already a full Gibraltar international, is quietly going under the radar having featured for Ten Hag in pre-season, with it clear his opportunity will soon be deliver
ed upon. Most likely to be used in a wide position, the incoming United boss could use all the help he can get and with teenagers as talented as Scanlon the future looks incredibly promising. If Amorim's favoured 3-4-3 system - that has been widely discussed - will be used at Old Trafford, Scanlon could unlock a whole new avenue for United, given his attacking capabilities on the left flank. Although there are plenty ahead of him, his international pedigree and terrific form at Under-18 level th
is season will continue to leave eyebrows raised over what can be achieved.

Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton says she is in the best shape of her career to date and is happy to have put "unsettling" speculation over her future behind her.  Clinton joined United from Everton in the summer of 2022 but made her name on loan at Tottenham Hotspur last season, registering four goals and four assists in the Women's Super League (WSL) for the north London side. Her form was so impressive that she was named the PFA Young Player of the Year, with Spurs boss Robert Vilah
amn keen to keep her at Brisbane Road.

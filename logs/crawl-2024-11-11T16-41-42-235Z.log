Ruud van Nistelrooy ensured he remains unbeaten as [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) manager over the weekend thanks to a 3-0 win over Leicester City in the [Premier League](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/premier-league).

Goals from [Bruno Fernandes](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bruno-fernandes) and [Alejandro Garnacho](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/alejandro-garnacho) as well as an own goal saw United come out as comfortable winners at [Old Trafford](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/old-trafford). It means that the team picked up three wins and a draw in Van Nistelrooy's four games in charge of the club.

This week sees the start of a new era with new head coach [Ruben Amorim](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/ruben-amorim) arriving from Sporting Clube de Portugal. He will take training this week in preparation for the Premier League clash against Ipswich Town after the international break.

Amorim's arrival does however put doubt over where Van Nistelrooy's future lies. The former striker arrived this summer as assistant manager to Erik ten Hag.

With Amorim bringing his own staff to the club, it remains to be seen if Van Nistelrooy will stay at the club, and if so, in what capacity with a decision expected today (Monday).

Stay here for the latest updates surrounding Amorim's arrival and Van Nistelrooy's future, as well as any other Manchester United news.

### Casemiro speaks out on Amorim appointment

### Meet Amorim's assistants

Sporting CP coaches Carlos Fernandes and Adelio Candido are expected to soon be confirmed as Ruben Amorim's assistant as United.

[MEN Sport](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/ruben-amorim-appears-confirm-manchester-30343983) also understands that Paulo Barreira, Emanuel Ferro, and Jorge Vital are also all due to be members of the newly-assembled backroom team.

Fernandes and Candido are [both younger than several members of the United squad and have been a part of Amorim's managerial journey for many years.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/carlos-fernandes-adelio-candido-manutd-30265538)

The pair are one of a new wave of staff to have gone straight into coaching having not sustained a professional playing career.

### Ruben Amorim unveiling

Ruben Amorim's first press conference after arriving at Manchester United, will not be an unveiling on, with the new head coach doing his normal pre-match media duties.

That will be the first time that the new man will talk to the media, with no unveiling press conference planned, according to the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14065769/Ruben-Amorim-work-permit-manchester-united.html).

It meant that the press conference will take place just a couple of days before the Premier League meeting against Ipswich at Portman Road. That game will see United come up against former assistant manager Kieran McKenna with his team winning their first game of the season against Tottenham last time out.

### What has been said on van Nistelrooy's future?

One big question today is on the future of Ruud van Nistelrooy, here has what has been said so far:

Following the game against Leicester, van Niselrooy said:

> "I appreciated the clear communication of the club, that it was interim for the short term," Van Nistelrooy said. "It could've been one or two games even, that was the first communication, and they kept me in the loop and said okay, it's gonna be four \[games\].
> 
> "For me, it is important to have that clarity and I appreciated that and in the end the most important thing is this football club, and I'm here to support that in my role.
> 
> "And, as I said, I want to continue doing that in the future and now also the communication was after the block of four games there will be communication towards you and your colleagues who are in an uncertain situation. And I expect to hear today or tomorrow."

Amorim has since given his own update:

> “About a legend of the club. He did a great job. I have to talk with him tomorrow. Then I will explain everything. I am very clear and I will tell you like it is. Let’s wait until tomorrow.”

Ruben Amorim has arrived at Manchester Airport to start work as [Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc) head coach, taking over the reins from interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy.

Amorim was appointed on November 1 but was only released from his Sporting contract after their Primera Liga fixture against Braga on Sunday night. He officially starts work at United today.

He left Lisbon to fly to Manchester at 11am on Monday, landing at [Manchester Airport](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-airport) at around 1.45pm. Amorim was accompanied by the five staff members he is bringing with him to the club, Carlos Fernandes, Adélio Cândido, Paulo Barreira, Emanuel Ferro and Jorge Vital.

Amorim had been due to meet club staff at Carrington this afternoon, with the non-internationals in the first-team squad also in today, but for now it is unclear if he will head to the training ground.

The 39-year-old is also set to hold talks with Van Nistelrooy over whether he will form a part of his backroom staff, having overseen three wins and a draw from his four games in charge.

Amorim can't take training sessions yet as he waits for his visa to come through, although that is expected to arrive swiftly. The squad will be off for the rest of the week before reconvening at Carrington to prepare for Amorim's first game in charge against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Sunday, November 24.

Next week will be the chance for Amorim to begin implementing his own playing style on the squad, with Van Nistelrooy yesterday saying there is still more to come from this squad as he was asked whether it would fit the new head coach's playing style.

"That is a very good question. What for me is important when I started as an interim at the beginning of this four game period and staff to stabilise and continue playing what the players are used to 85 percent and put in little tweaks or changing players and resting players and that is where you start to get your own bit of identity in, try to get the confidence back," he said.

"You could see the quality of the players still not in a consistent way because there is a lot to improve but there is a foundation in the last four games of strong unity, good spirit, players who were at it and looking for results and we got four. It is a lot to analyse, are there wing-backs, inside forwards, I can’t comment on that."
